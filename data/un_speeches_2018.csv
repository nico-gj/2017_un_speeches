Afghanistan,"jt -^ , • \jf 4 statement by the chief executive of the islamic republic of afghanistan h.e. dr. abdullah abdullah 73""° session of the united nations general assembly united nations, new york september 26,2018 e^jii 6^jji ^ madame president, excellencies heads-of-state and governments, ladies and gentlemen. allow me to start by extending my congratulations to you madame president and wishing the 73*^^ unga presidency much success. let me also assure you that working with un member states and the un family, we look forward to advancing the seven priorities set in the unga73 agenda. from this podium, iwould like to provide the general assembly with the latest in regard to the situation in afghanistan - the gains, opportunities and challenges that my nation faces at this critical juncture - in addition to our views on other key global challenges. the record of accomplishments by this institution over the past 73 years demonstrates that wherever it might be, and whoever it might impact, we cannot escape the ripple effects of, or delink ourselves from the global, national, communal and human connectivities that bind us, whether in relation to the environment, climate, international finance or even the cyber and technology arenas. it is therefore critically important to go beyond just words, duplication of efforts or ineffective models that get inter-mingled and, at times, spur countervailing or lopsided interests. as albert einstein once said: we cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them. whether we are addressing hunger, acute poverty, climate change, overpopulation, terrorism, conflict, displacement, inequality or organized crime, we all share and own bits and pieces of the problems, in the same manner that we collectively benefit or learn from the solutions. as a result, we need to explore new means and identify new tools for reaching a wider consensus through more thoughtful dialog and result-oriented action. henceforth, to this day, we do not have a globally and officially acceptable definition for ""terrorism,"" a nefarious phenomenon used by rogue or politically-connected, criminal, state or non-state actors, using religious, ideological, economic or psychological cover to disrupt the status-quo, upend the global and nation-state order and reach a particular set of radical goals through the sheer use of indiscriminate violence that no religion in its undistorted form condones. while we are determined to fight with vigor newer versions of terror presenting themselves as remnants of daesh in a few pockets inside afghanistan, we are still struggling to fully comprehend the role that terror breeding grounds sanctuaries and funding pools - in many cases tied to criminal and illicit drug networks - play in the use and spread of terrorism. we are still trying to figure out how to render terrorism impotent as a policy tool used by some to further specific agendas. for example, afghanistan has for almost a quarter of a century experienced the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives and major infrastructural damage; it is partly because of geography, and partly because of short-sighted strategies and regional agendas that have generated an umbilical reliance on non-state actors used to keep others unstable through violence and the promotion of extremism. it has resulted in complacency and impunity. thus, we need to do more and go beyond the ineffective norms to bring about change and accountability. we have asked our neighboring states, especially pakistan, to help targeted societies - including their own - deal with this menace. we are looking forward to the timely and effective implementation of the recently agreed afghanistan-pakistan action plan for peace and solidarity (appaps). all stakeholders need to agree to treat all shades of terrorism as one, shut down the breeding grounds and sanctuaries and to prosecute or repatriate the violators. the response thus far has been sparse and insufficient. we are working with all countries near and afar to bring about better results. on that basis, afghanistan stands for the balanced implementation of all four pillars of the un global counter-terrorism strategy; and noncompliance must be seriously addressed as well. my country has also begun a process of structured cooperation with the un office on counter-terrorism and we are supportive of regional initiatives through forums that focus on such priority concerns. we will continue to engage and work with regional stakeholders in this regard. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. since we last met, afghanistan has turned a page and made unprecedented overtures to the taliban to be part of a credible afghan-owned and afghan-led peace process that could lead to a just and comprehensive political settlement through talks and reconciliation. on several occasions, we have pledged our commitment to unconditional intra-afghan dialog and the restoration of all rights and privileges for those who agree to end the cycle of violence. we even announced a unilateral ceasefire earlier this year that was agreed to by the taliban for a three-day period and gave the afghans a glimpse of what peace can look and feel like. unfortunately, extraneous agendas prevented us to replicate a second ceasefire more recently. but we will not rest, and we have vowed to pursue what is right and attainable. i want to express my sincere thanks to all nations, especially the united states, concerned nations and parties, including the governments of the kingdom of saudi arabia and indonesia- both of whom recently hosted ulema gatherings-the un and others for encouraging all sides to set the stage for a process that would lead to talks and a just and comprehensive negotiated settlement. looking at the 25 year-long record, a pre-requisite for talks is to learn from the history of peace engagements. we see that a dual approach is necessary to make sure that we win the peace but also protect and preserve our people's gains and hard-earned achievements; they include the constitutional order, freedom of expression, human and gender rights and creating economic opportunities. i want to pause here and pay tribute to afghans who continue to suffer as a result of violence, as well as to our valiant national security forces for their steadfast defense of our nation and for standing tall and strong at the frontline against terrorism. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. two important popular tests are ahead in afghanistan: parliamentary elections slated for next month and presidential elections for next year. drawing on past experiences, both president ashrafghani and i agree that political legitimacy is derived from the will of the people. while we pursue peace efforts and deal with security and governance challenges, we are reminded that, eventually, we need to make sure that, given our circumstances, the electoral process is trust-worthy and that the electorate can agree to a fairly credible and legitimate outcome. regardless of who wins or loses, afghanistan's future rests on nurturing national consensus that provides unity of purpose aimed at peace and political stability deriving legitimacy from foundations that are pluralistic, inclusive and democratic. in this regard, i want to thank the united nations - unama in particular - the european union and all other contributors and donors for helping us move the process forward. furthermore, we look forward to the upcoming geneva ministerial on afghanistan in november. it will be an excellent occasion to evaluate our work and the path ahead with the donors since we last met. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. on the humanitarian front, afghanistan also faces the daunting tasks associated with an impending drought, refugee resettlement and internal displacement caused by climactic and natural abnormalities, food insecurity and security threats. estimated to impact two-third of the country and the livelihoods of more than four million people, with the potential to force a million more into migration, we are in dire to attend to their humanitarian needs. i want to thank the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, other un agencies, ngos and donors for their contributions and hard work on the ground, however, we urge the international community to fully fund afghanistan's humanitarian response plan 2018-2021. excellencies, dear colleagues. the peaceful settlement of disputes and protection of oppressed peoples are core principles of the un charter, which benefit the promotion and preservation of international peace and security. as a war-ravaged country, we sympathize and feel for the people of syria, yemen and other victimized communities around the world, in the same manner that we stand for the basic rights to protection of the rohingya population in myanmar. afghanistan stands in full support of all un and other international efforts aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the question of palestine, including a un general assembly call for an international protection mechanism for civilians. moreover, the un's refined peace-building activities should provide due focus on the principle of national ownership; implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development; and promoting greater coherence among relevant un entities and agencies and development. in regard to the reform agenda, we stand in full support of efforts aimed at strengthening the role of the un in the context of the secretary general's initiatives. the creation of the department of political and peace-building affairs is a welcome move, as is the formation of the office of counter-terrorism. we are looking forward to the implementation of the resolution adopted on the repositioning of un development system and believe it will enhance our achievements in the formation of one-un in afghanistan. afghanistan's active role within the un system is currently more pronounced than ever before. our chairmanship of the third rrl committee during the 73 session comes at a crucial time as we have aimed to initiate and adopted several resolutions on shared themes that include victims of terrorism and threats of leds, in addition to refugee and migrant issues, rights of children, women's empowerment, human rights, social development, and other relevant committee agenda items. furthermore, afghanistan's election to the un human rights council for the first time in 2017 marked our commitment and showcased our achievements in this regard. we remain a party to major international protocols and conventions on human rights. i am pleased to inform that afghanistan has recently passed a set of national legislation prohibiting cruel and degrading treatment, endorsed the law inhibiting torture, on combating human and migrants trafficking, criminal procedures code, and on prohibition of children recruitment in our security forces. on the latter, we are working closely with the office of special representative of the secretary-general on children and armed conflict. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, i want to leave this podium today by presenting a bold concept - also recently mentioned by president ghani - that can form a new visionary paradigm for my country and our region as we strive to end four decades of conflict and enter a new phase free of violence and forced implementation of stagnant ideas and spoiler habits. it is a concept that dwells on afghanistan over the next few years becoming a platform of cordiality for regional and hemispheric cooperation, in sharp contrast to being pushed and pulled toward becoming an area of instability and confrontation. our people, who pose no danger to anyone, are demanding a fundamental change where they can play a constructive and collaborative role across boundaries, and help turn their country into a roundabout of people, goods, services, communications, cooperation and ideas across the wider region. i believe that with your help we can turn this concept into reality. we hope to further engage our regional partners in helping us bring this vision to fruition. i hope that this assembly and all concerned member states play their supportive and positive role to put an end to years of agony and open a new path leading to durable peace, stability and prosperity. thank you. 10","abdullah abdullah, chief executive of afghanistan, recalled that no one escapes the ripple effects of the global, national, communal and human connectivities that bind them through climate, international finance or cyber and technology arenas. it is regrettable that there is no globally and officially acceptable definition for “terrorism”, which he described as a nefarious phenomenon used by rogue or politically-connected, criminal, state or non-state actors using religious, ideological, economic or psychological cover to disrupt the status quo and upend the global and nation-state order. underlining that no religion in its undistorted form condones the sheer use of indiscriminate violence to reach radical goals, he added that he is determined to fight newer versions of terror in the form of remnants of islamic state in iraq and the levant (isis/da’esh) inside afghanistan. “we are still trying to figure out how to render terrorism impotent as a policy tool,” he said. he deplored the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives and major infrastructural damage during the last 25 years due to geography and short‑sighted strategies and regional agendas, among other challenges. noting the call to neighboring countries like pakistan to help targeted societies to deal with the menace, he pointed to the timely and effective implementation of the afghanistan-pakistan action plan for peace and solidarity. the implementation of the united nations global counter-terrorism strategy must be balanced and non-compliance seriously addressed. he pointed to the unprecedented overtures to the taliban as a part of a credible afghan‑owned and ‑led peace process. to bring about peace and to protect afghans’ gains and achievement, such as constitutional order, freedom of expression and human and gender rights, a dual approach is needed. on the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, he said that their political legitimacy derives from the will of the people and that the electoral process must be trustworthy, in the hopes of agreeing to a fairly credible and legitimate outcome. the humanitarian challenges like the impending drought, refugee resettlement and internal displacement, food insecurities and security threats will impact about two thirds of the country and the livelihoods of more than 4 million people, he said, urging the international community to fully fund the afghanistan humanitarian response plan 2018‑2021. welcoming and supporting the reform efforts of the united nations, he said that the creation of the department of political and peacebuilding affairs as well as the formation of the office of counter-terrorism is a welcome move. he is also looking forward to the enhancement of the achievements in the formation of one un for afghanistan and he welcomed the chairmanship of the third committee during the seventy-third session, aiming to initiate and adopt resolutions concerning victims of terrorism and threats of improvised explosive devices, refugee and migrant crises, rights of children, women’s empowerment, human rights and social development. he also noted the adoption of national legislation prohibiting cruel and degrading treatment, adding he endorsed the law inhibiting torture, on combating human and migrants trafficking and prohibition of children recruitment in their security forces. a bold concept forming a new visionary paradigm for afghanistan and the region will help to end four decades of conflict. his country will thusly enter a new phase, free from violence and forced implementation of stagnant ideas."
Albania,"republic of albania the president remarks of the p esident of the republic of alba ia h*e. mr* ilir meta, at the 73 sessio of the general' assembly of the united nations making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies new york on 28th september 2018 madam president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, let me first join yo all in congratulating and wishing success to madam president espinosa garces, and assuring her excellency of albania s full support in her tasks and mission. the topic of this general debate making the united nations relevant to all people takes us to the heart of multilateralism; the kind that our nations have built, through global leadership and shared responsibilities to the benefit of peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. while sharing the need for constant pursuit of reform, we remain faithful to the fundamental principles of this organization. we continue to see the united nations as a multilateral instrument through which peaceful international order is safeguarded. the un was created in a concert of sovereign wills that have produced a corpus of rules and good practices as global solution to global problems. the un neither has a life of its own, outside the will of its members, nor is it immune of occurring changes and developments. the un has grown as the world has gone more global. democracy, human rights, securit , development issues, technological advancement and the world wide web, environmental issues, and much more, are increasingly present in the un agenda, just as they dominate our domestic policies. albania shares its responsibility to be active in this debate, adding relevance to our part of the world. it is in this spirit that we fully support secretary general guterres's vision for reform and the achievement of the sustainable development goals at national, regional and international level. -1- we strongly believe that agenda 2030 is universal, as it is relevant to and applicable in all countries of the world. we have taken a clear stance through a unanimous resolution adopted by the albanian parliament expressing our firm commitment to implementing and achieving these goals. albania presented its national voluntary report this july, incorporating a combination of its european agenda objectives with those of sustainable development. i would like to emphasize that these strategic documents are fully compatible and coherent with our national strategic project of european integration. albania's national strategy for development and integration enshrines the same strategic vision and objectives for development: that of good governance, rule of law, a competitive and sustainable economy, promotion and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. as we look forward to a future decision to open accession negotiation with the eu, we remain committed to progress with domestic reforms in key areas. we also consider the eu prerogative of open regional cooperation as an indispensable policy. with on-going peace and integration processes in the balkans, we believe that every bilateral achievement among our countries contributes directly to the greater peace, security, stability and economic development. we consider that the recently reached agreement between greece and macedonia, has the opportunity to becoming a historic achievement. we have called on all political actors in macedonia, including upon local albanian leaders to be actively engaged in ensuring the success of the 30 september referendum, supporting a vote in favor of this agreement. nato s open door policy towards the western balkans remains as vital and decisive to anchoring the region to its securit umbrella and for responsible local ownership. -2- in this context, i strongly welcome the recent messages that our strategic partners sent to the macedonian people. these messages echo their determination to uphold the immense investment to establishing stabilit and security in the last two decades in the balkans. the combined commitment of both nato and eu are the best guarantor for all the countries and citizens of our region. this positive momentum can also nurture further progress in the eu-led dialog between kosova and serbia. the dialog has entered in its final stage, expected to be concluded with a legally binding agreement on the comprehensive normalization of relations between the two states. it is of paramount importance that this expected agreement embodies positive energy, fostering european values of interethnic co-existence and harmony. it is extremely important that this agreement marks a breakaway from history and the past, and improves the daily lives of the peoples in both states. let us bear in mind that the historic past of the balkans is notoriously linked to border changes, ethnic cleansing and violent massive displacements. yet, in the last two decades, the balkans has undergone a tremendous transformation, thanks to un support and involvement, and the serious political, social and economic investments of the usa and the eu. we call on and welcome ever effort of the un-member states in continuing kosova s international recognition, and further supporting its membership to the regional and international organizations. based on the stability and the positive developments in kosova, albania supports the reduction of the sessions held in un-security council on the unmik reports. -3- distinguished dele ates, albania fully supports a more effective un agenda through a more integrated peace and security architecture, with peacekeeping operations being vital instruments and a flagship activity of the united nations. we support the recent initiative of the secretary general - action for peacekeeping (a4p), and we have endorsed the declaration on this initiative. albanian fully supports the united nations security council resolution 2242, and the substantively similar resolutions on the review of the peaceb ilding architecture, adopted by the un general assembly and the securit council. we remain confident that un secretary general guterres will keep up the momentum for a revitalized role of the un, with special focus on prevention of peace and security in the world. his platform on the revitalization of the un is promising and we support it. let me note that more than 6500 members of the albanian armed forces and civilians have participated in international peacekeeping operation since 1996. they have contributed to operation in bosnia-herzegovina, chad, south sudan, afghanistan, etc. we have pledged to continue our modest but firm contribution. albania has been aligned with all the un initiatives fighting terrorism, ratifying 12 out of 19 un related conventions and protocols. albania joined the immediate response of the global coalition against violent extremism, and notably in the fight against isis/da esh. as a nato member, last year we have tripled our troop contribution to afghanistan. our contribution to the collective efforts in fighting illegal migration in the mediterranean is significant. -4- we are part of nato s maritime mission in the aegean assisting frontex to stop migration smuggling. albania believes that the protection of civilians, women and children are of a crucial importance in peacekeeping operations, because the life of every person is precious. we welcome the growing attention on the role of regional organizations in security issues. in this frame, we highly appreciate and welcome the close cooperation between the united nations and the european union, on the platform of the common security and defense policy (csdp). in order to have a safer and more peaceful planet, concrete steps have to be undertaken. in this regard, albania hails the progress under the leadership of the united states of america on denuclearization of the korean peninsula, considering it as very positive step forward, not only for that region, but for entire planet as well. another issue of serious concern threatening peace and security, is the ongoing conflict in syria. we support all the actions taken by the international actors to end the conflict and stop the use of chemical weapons. humanitarian situation has been further worsened and this tragedy has produced millions of displaced and war refugees, threating also the security of neighboring countries and of the european continent. the situation in libya also, is still concerning us seriously, and we reconfirm our strong commitment to the unity and territorial integrity of libya and emphasize the need to de-escalate the violence in the country, as well as the spread of terrorism. we have supported the international community's efforts to develop an inclusive political dialog between the parties on the future of libya, as the only way to stopping the conflict and resolving the libyan crisis, which is seriously threatening, not only direct neighbors. -5- the conflict between israel and palestine is still harming the peace and stability in the middle east. a two-state solution will realistically allow both sides to fulfill their aspirations, put an end to the conflict, and achieve the just and lasting peace for israelis and palestinians. we have always welcomed and supported efforts from all sides and those of the international community to find a solution through negotiations. few days ago, i expressed on behalf of albania the full support for the principles and implementation of the declaration on global call for drug problem in the world, initiated by the united states. we all need to take bold actions and act together to uproot drugs from the life of our youths and children and sa e our societies, our national security and public health. for this reason, we have to strengthen the international cooperation and build a common basis of understanding of the problem and take effective measures against it. in this conte t, i would also like to underline that albania has an excellent cooperation with united nations office on drugs nd crime (unodc). as a country, with valuable contributions in enforcing peace, stability, progress, in respecting and protecting the universal human rights, and strongly believing into multilateralism, albania seeks to serve as a non¬ permanent member of the security council for the term 2022-2023. to this goal we stand ready to engage constructively in conflict preventions and various peace operations, in the un and other security regional organizations, in implementing sustainable development policies and contributing to the universal respect of the human rights. albania is committed to protect and promote all human rights and supports the integration of the human rights dimension in the agenda of united nations. -6- finally, i would like to address the issue of the climate change, affecting eveiy country in each continent. it is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing dearly to the people, communities and countries. the historical paris agreement of 2015, based on the un framework convention on climate change and kyoto protocol, provided the legally binding international commitment to engage with concrete action. albania has adopted relevant strategies and action plans, and is taking necessary measures to protect environment and reduce gas emission. it is quite clear that the consequences of climate changes are moving faster than we do. we have to prevent it and save the existence of the planet and of next generations. collective efforts to address collective challenges. thank you ! -7-","ilir meta, president of albania, acknowledging the need for reform in the organization, emphasized that his country remains faithful to the fundamental principles of the united nations. underscoring that the 2030 agenda for sustainable development is relevant and applicable in all countries, he said the albanian parliament has unanimously expressed its firm commitment to achieving the sustainable development goals. those goals and albania’s european agenda are compatible and coherent with its european integration project. further, albania’s development and integration strategies rest on the principles of good governance, rule of law, a competitive and sustainable economy, and the promotion and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. regarding the ongoing peace and integration processes in the balkans, he said every bilateral achievement among countries of that region contributes directly to increasing peace, security, stability and economic development. the recently concluded agreement between greece and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has the potential to become an historic achievement. he urged all political actors in the latter country — including local albanian leaders — to remain actively engaged by supporting a vote in favor of the agreement on the 30 september referendum. emphasizing the importance of the north atlantic treaty organization’s (nato) open door policy towards the western balkans, he said the positive momentum in the region could nurture further progress in the european union‑led dialog between kosovo and serbia. it is of paramount importance that this agreement fosters the european values of interethnic co‑existence and harmony. the history of the balkans is notoriously linked to border changes, ethnic cleansing and violent massive displacements, he recalled. yet, in the last two decades, the region has undergone a tremendous transformation thanks to the united nations support and involvement, and the serious political, social and economic investments of the united states and the european union. he said his country welcomes and encourages every effort of the united nations member states in continuing kosovo’s international recognition and its membership in regional and international organizations. noting the stability and positive development in that country, he expressed support for a reduction of the sessions held by the security council on the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo (unmik) reports. he went on to express support for the security council resolution 2242 (2015) and a more integrated peace and security architecture, adding his vote of confidence that secretary‑general guterres will be able to continue working towards revitalizing the organization’s role with a focus on peace and security. underlining that more than 6,500 members of the albanian armed forces and civilians have participated in international peacekeeping operations since 1996, he reaffirmed his country’s pledge to continue its modest but firm contribution. he expressed deep appreciation for the close cooperation between the united nations and the european union on the platform of the common security and defense policy and welcomed the leadership of the united states on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula, describing it as “a very positive step forward not only for that region but for the entire planet as well”. however, the situation in syria and libya are concerning, he said, emphasizing that the crisis in libya can only be resolved through an inclusive political dialog between the two parties. he reiterated his country’s support for the global call to action on the world drug problem initiated by the united states. reaffirming its strong belief in multilateralism, he said albania would seek to serve as a non‑permanent member of the security council for the 2022‑2023 term, adding that his country stands ready to engage constructively in conflict prevention and peace operations through the united nations and other regional organizations."
Algeria,,"abdelkader messahel, minister for foreign affairs of algeria, said global concerns with regard to nuclear weapons have never been so great since the cold war. climate change is developing faster than the international community can respond and inequality is increasing. nationalism and xenophobia are getting worse. the seriousness of these challenges is heightened by a financial crisis that is still present. this is even more alarming because of the emergence of unilateralism and protectionist desires. the international community cannot content itself with the perpetuation of the global order which no longer promotes universal values of peace and development. rather than contributing to improving the lives of people, financial resources are being concentrated in the hands of the few. a genuine global moral crisis is being faced. the theme for the seventy‑third session is particularly appropriate. today, the united nations must find a way to enable it to play the role that its founders assigned it. the united nations remains the forum for dialog among all nations, but it must also provide the changes that are necessary to bring this about, he said. the reform of the united nations itself is imperative and it must relate to the structures as well as the functioning of the organization, particularly the security council and repairing the injustice done to the african continent in terms of representation in the two categories of members for the council. the reform must also take into account the general assembly and the strengthening of its authority. there is an ever greater consensus around this issue. with regard to the western sahara, he said that resolving the issue cannot be done other than through the exercise of self‑determination by the people there. his government supports the work of the secretary‑general and the special envoy and he hopes that their action will contribute to the resumption of unconditional negotiations between morocco and the polisario front to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution. algeria was the first target of terrorism at the turn of the last century, he noted. now that threat has become a global scourge. algeria’s experience, which his country is prepared to share, is based on the belief that any strategy to combat terrorism must address its root causes and must be accompanied by a fight against radicalization and violent extremism."
Andorra,"missio permanent del principat d'andorra a ees nacions unides cj)eck against deliimy session of the united nations general assembly —speech by the head of the andonan government, antoni maiti petit— new york, 28""' september 2018 madam president, ivlr. secretary-general, your excellencies, ladies and gendcmcn, for the people of andorra, 2018 is a year of celebration in two ways: globally and locally. on the 28""' of july, the principality of andorra celebrated 25 years since its entry into the united nations; and on the 10""' of december, it will be 70 years since the universal declaration of human rights. 'i'hese two events have, as thave already mentioned, a double meaning: a global one and a local one. what some peojilc call 'glocal'. in fact, the 1948 universal declaration of human rights has a global dimension for andorra, as well as the other countries that make up the international communitj'. but it also has great local roots; because fundamcntfll rights have been respected in andorra since rime immemorial; therefore, it is no wonder that the andorran constitution expressly stales that the universal declaration of human rights is in force in andorra, this is why our country has wanted to take an acdve part in the 'stand up for human rights' campaign, emphasizing the dissemination of the important rights in the education area. the high cojiimissioner for human rights, michelle bachelct —^with whom i have had the honor of coinciding in the ibcro-amcrican community over recent years— knows that slie may count on antlorra for the declaration made on the 10""'of december 1948 to remain as valid and sti-ong as ever. two united nations plaza, 27th floor - new york, n.v. 10017 tcrfon (212) 750 8064, fax (212) 750 6630 because, as i have already said, the universal declaration of human rights was already part of andorran positive law even beforeandorra became part of die united nations. now i would ask you to think back to what the world was like 25 years ago, when andorra joined this organization as a full member. 1993 was a time of hope for everyone: the fall of the iron curtain and the end of the cold war gave way to a wave of unprecedented democratization. never had so many people in the world lived under democracy as during the final years of the 20'""' century and the beginning of the 21** century. human rights were consolidated, economies grew and inequalities were gradually reducing. i'hcy were years of peace, cooperation and multilateralism; of respect, understanding and dialog between cultures and religions; and around us, on the old continent, they were years of optimismin a long, fruitful process of european construction. today, we all remember that period with some nostalgia. we were able to see it this summer, during the meaningful homages paid to the secretary-general kofi annan, who did so much for peace and multilateralism at the end of the last century and beginning of tliis millennium. and we have just seen it this week, during the peace summit dedicated to nelson mandela, who was, without a doubt, one of the key characters of that historic moment. 25 years on, many of the hopes of 1993 have become blurred and some of the milestones reached have taken us backwards. the prestigious non-governmental organization freedom house has noted —^year afteryear— a constant decline in world democracy since 2006. in its last report, we read that in 2017, only 4 out of every 10 people live in free countries. this slowdecline in democratic regimes has been accompanied by an increase in inequality, intolerance and extremism. even in established democracies, we increasingly hear the voices of people who have put up with discrimination in silence for many years: women, disabled people, victims of sexual abuse or of any kind, and so on. all this shows us tliat our optimism 25 years ago was rather naive. however, despite all the deceptions and despite all the faults, all we can do is to continue defending the international order tliat was created by the united nations, just after the second world war. because it is an order that is based on three principles tliat arc as elemental as they are universal: all of us have the same rights; what affects all of us must be decided by all of us; any conflict must be solved peacefully and lawfully. when i say ""all of us"" i refer to everj'body, individually, within a representative democracy; and also to all the countries, on an equal footing, at tliis general assembly. representative democracy and multilateralism are tlie result of common values and, therefore, it is not surprising that they have a crisis at the same time. the way i see it, democratic, multilateral order is threatened by two extremes: populism and technocracy. in the face of complex problems, populism proposes solutions that are simple but that are not really solutions, because they end up creating new problems and questioning democratic principles and values. technocracy, in the face of complex problems, proposes solutions tliat are as complex as (hey are elitist. solutions that are not inclusive, that generate inequalit)' and that leave many people aside. populism is fed on the deception of these people who have been left aside and who have suffered from exclusion, lack of understanding and inequality. in recent years, we have said time and time again that the world is struggling between opening up and closing down, between multilateralism and unilateralism, between cooperation and protectionism. but perhaps the mistake lies in wishing to present things in this way. all too often, defenders of multilateral order and of globalization believe that we have not made any errors and that it is the other people who are mistaken. without seeing that globalization has created antibodies; and that not all the antibodies are harmful, because perhaps not every kind of globalization is good. in the face of this dialectic between opening up and closing down, we should not seek confrontation but look for balances. there needs to be a balance between cosmopolitanism and being deeply rooted, because there are good things in both areas. we have commented on the risk of protectionism, populism and closing down far too often without realizing that there is also another risk: that of elitist globalization which is inhuman and not very inclusive, if at all. very often the solutions we have found to major international questions —^whether they ace geopolitical, economic or social— are solutions that do not consider people and that go against one of the slogans of the united nations, the imperative ""leaving noone behind"". therefore, 1 view the theme chosen by the president of this general assembly, maria fernanda espinosa —^with whom we also share the lbero-american community— very positively: ""making tlie united nations relevant to all people"" and this means constructing ""peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies"". ladies and gentlemen, lee action of the united nations, and by extension of the entire international community, must be inclusive and focused on the real problems of people. because, if this were not the case, we would be persevering with our mistakes: we would reinforce the image of international institutions that are difficult to understand and far removed from people, and we would be opening thedoor to populism even wider. this is why andorra wants to participate in a particularly active way in promoting and achieving the sustainable development goals of the 2030 agenda. these objectives are focused on specific, tangible needs of the world population; they are large global objectives that have local applications and impacts; and, if they are obtained, they will reinforce the bonds that are so necessary between people and institutions. andorra presented the first voluntary national review on the sustainable development goals at the pligh-lcvel political forum of the ecosoc last july. as explained in the review, our government has been working for some time classifying the different political actions into the 17 sustainable development goals of the 2030 agenda. it has also set up a campaign to involve the education community, civil society and private companies in promoting and achieving the various goals. this is a way of opening up and bringing the united nations and its agenda closer to the people. in our opinion, innovation and the new technologies play a very important role in acliicving tlic sustainable development goals. this is why we need a transversal alliance between the public and the private sectors to make the technological advances available to the 2030 agenda. we have assessed our level of compliance with six sustainable development goals linked to the environment: water and sanitation; clean, accessible energy; sustainable cities; responsible consumption and production; protecting life on liarth and combadng the climate change. various actions introduced by the government in recent years follow the lines to meet these goals: the permanent improvement of water and air quality; a complete plan ofenergy transition tliat has enabled us to reduce our dependence on the exterior and to promote renewable energ)'; direct grants for renewing buildings using energy efficient criteria and so on. all these actions areaimed at complying with the 2030 agenda. andorra has also placed an emphasis on two more goals: measures to combat the climate change and quality education. because these are two things with which the andorran society identifies in a transversal way. therefore, we vindicate the validity of the agreement on climate change that many countries signed here, in new york, in april 2016; and we insist that the international community must comply with the agreements and commitments made in paris in december 2015. we reiterated tliis in paris last december, during the one planet summit, promoted by the secretary-general and by the president of the french republic and coprince of andorra, emmanuel macron. andorra is working to fiilfil the commitments of the paris /vgreement and strongly encourages the rest of the international communit)' to do the same. as far as quality education is concerned, andorra is proud of having a rich, diverse, integrating education system that is available to all citizens. asystem in which families can opt for andorran, spanish or french education and one which prepares our young people to become citizens of a global world, deeply rooted in tlieir own country and own identit)'. this is perhaps why a great deal of andorran international cooperation effort focuses on the area of education. several andorran non-governmental organizations —^with the financial support of the government— are carr)'ing out projects to promote training and opportunities for street children in bolivia, to educate young girls in honduras and to provide schoolingfor poor children in madagascar. your excellencies, when choosing the theme for this general assembly, our president talks to us about leadership and shared responsibilities: ""global leadersliip and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies."" this would seem to me to be a key matter: if we allow the action of the united nations, and by extension of the entire international community, to move away from people's real needs, we would be losing leadersliip. in the face of the increase in populism and extremism, political leaders often feel they are misunderstood. however misunderstood leaders do not exist; because a misunderstood leader is not a leader. a leader who does not connectwith the people is not a leader. the united nations cannot afford the luxury of disconnecting from the problems, needs, expectations and hopes of the eitizens of this globalized world. therefore, andorra offers support to the plans to reform the architecture ofthe united nations that are being carried out by secretary-general guterres and his team. a more efficient management of resources is liighly necessary; particularly a management focused on people. madam president, ivh. secretary-general, friends of the international community. please allow me, in this final part of my speech, to make a short personal comment. seven and a half years ago i took on the responsibility of leading the government of the principality ofandorra. aresponsibility that the ballot boxes gave me again in march 2015. therefore, this will be the last time that i take part in a united nations general assembly. in andorra, the men and women of my generation started in politics coinciding with the approval of the 1993 constitution and witli the recognition of our country as a full member of the international community. i was elected a member of parliament the same year that andorra became a part of the united nations. therefore, i am a child of that time of optimism that i mentioned at the beginning. of those years in which democracy was spreading, economies were growing and multilateral institutions were strengthening. however, it was up to me and the people of my generation to take on fuu responsibilities to govern in a time of crisis; of economic crisis, of social crisis and of a crisis in values, at a time when whatwe believed to be solid and resistant was proving to be fragile and unstable. over time, we have got used to living with this awareness offragilit)' and instability. when all is said and done, maybe it is not so bad. our predecessors, the old people ofandorra, were very aware ofthe fragility ofthe balances on which our very old institutions stand. ifi compare it with the spirit ofoptimism of25 years ago, the symbol ofour times, oftliis current moment, is precisely this awareness of fragility: of the economy, the institutions, the worldwide geopolitical order, the environment, of the planet as a whole. everything seems to be much more fragile, in much greater danger. from this awareness of fragility we have found the strength to undertake actions that had been sitting on the table for years, to make reforms that had been outstanding for decades: to have a more open, transparent and cooperative economy; to construct a more inclusive and integrating society; to find sustainable models of growth; and to preserve the institutions and values we had been handed down through history, adapting them and making them useful for today's people. out ofnecessity we have made virtue; out ofweakness we have found strength. so tliat the younger generations may lake the reins of their times with the same optimism we had 25 years ago. we must work right tlirough to the last moment so that our deceptions become their hope; so that from our mistakes they find the ability to prevent tlicm from happening again; and so that our good choices arc the foundations on which they can continue to build peaceful, cquilablc and sustainable societies. and that all of us —the older generations and the younger ones— should always be aware that cveiytliing that happens in the global area has local repercussions; and that all the actions that we do on a local basis contribute to shaping the global society. a global society in which everybody feels tliat theyarc listened to and included. a global society to which andorra —from its smallness, but also from the serenity of centuries of peaceful existence— is fully committed. the secretary-general, the president of this 73""' general assembly and all our friends in theinternational community know this. politicians move on, countries and institutions remain; and i'm sure that in the future you will continue to count on the principality of andorra to construct a faker, safer world. thank you very much.","antoni martí petit, prime minister of andorra, said that 25 years ago, when his country joined the united nations as a full member, it was a time of hope for everyone. the fall of the iron curtain and the end of the cold war gave way to a wave of unprecedented democratization. human rights were consolidated, economies grew and inequalities were gradually reduced. twenty‑five years later, many of the hopes of that time have become blurred. freedom house has noted a constant decline in world democracy since 2006. in its last report it noted that in 2017, only 4 out of every 10 people live in free countries. this slow decline in democratic regimes has been accompanied by an increase in inequality, intolerance and extremism, he continued. however, despite all the deceptions and faults, the international order should be defended because it is an order that is based on principles that are as elemental as they are universal. representative democracy and multilateralism are the result of common values and it is therefore not surprising that they are facing a crisis at the same time and being threatened by populism and technocracy. in the face of complex problems, populism proposes solutions that are not really solutions because they end up creating new problems and questioning democratic principles and values. technocracy, in the face of complex problems, proposes solutions that are as complex as they are elitist. the actions of the united nations must be inclusive and focused on the real problems of people, he said. this is why his country wants to participate in an active way in promoting and achieving the sustainable development goals. these objectives are focused on specific, tangible needs of the world population. they are large, global objectives that have local applications. if they are reached they will reinforce the bonds that are necessary between people and institutions. andorra presented its first voluntary national review at the high‑level political forum in july. its government has set up a campaign to involve the education community, civil society and private companies in the promotion and achievement of the various goals. andorra has also focused on measures to combat climate change, and support quality education, he said. insisting that the international community comply with the agreements and commitments made in paris in december 2015, he added that his government is working to fulfill the commitments of the paris agreement. as far as quality education is concerned, andorra is proud of having a rich, diverse and integrated education system that is available to all citizens. it is a system in which families can opt for andorran, spanish or french education and one which prepares the nation’s young people to become citizens of a global world. the united nations cannot afford the luxury of disconnecting from the problems, needs, expectations and hopes of the citizens of this globalized world, he said. andorra offers support to the plans to reform the architecture of the united nations that are being carried out by the united nations secretary‑general and his team. a more efficient management of resources is highly necessary, particularly management that is focused on people."

distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, we are holding this 73rd general assembl at special moment, as we pay tribute to two great figures of world olitics who happen to e two africans -nelson mandela and kofi annan. on the da t at i complete exactly one year since my inaugurat on to t e pos of president of the republic of angola, on ehalf of the angolan people, i have the honor to address this tribune for the first time, with the hole internation l community represented here by its highest dignitaries. 1 would like to salute your excellencies heads of state and government present here and also the leaders from various inte ational organizations an bodies, because i consider you o be the direct laborers for the future of our planet. 1 would like to seize this sovereign opportunity to thank all of t e international com unity for the support rendered to the cause of eace and national reconciliation in my cou try. a special t ank goes to the united n tions orga ization itself hose role was decisive for the achievement of long-lasti g peace in angola through t e unavem and monua. peace 1 missions, and the important work ndertaken by its specialized agencies, namely unicef and the wfp ( world food program). we also believe that angola s experience in peaceb ilding and reconciliation between the warrin forces has been a positive example for the united nations, in the sense that it has allowed to dra useful conclusions on how to approach peace processes in other regions of the world. angola has a unique experience in terms of how to preserve and maintain long-lasting peace and con tant deepening of national reconciliation, social inclusion, mutual forgiveness and healing of wounds from an armed confl ct which ended 16 year s ago. your majesties, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. it is at this broad forum where we find ourselves that best solutions to the current, serious problems and conflicts that may hinder the urvival of humanity itself are discussed and resolved. 1 am referring to hunger and misery', which affect millions of citizens in the world, global warming and its consequences, mass migrations, trafficking in narcotics, trafficking in human beings, children and women for forced prostitution, religious intolerance and extremism, inter¬ ethnic aimed conflicts, or even the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons. established 73 years ago with the declared inte tion of restoring universal peace a d harmony, to provide equal rights to big and small nations a d to establish a world of cooperation, progress and ell-being, the united nations organization is still far from achieving the goals enshrined in its charter. while it is true that right after its establishment, the i mediate bipolarization of the planet into two antagonistic political and economic systems did not contribute to the easy enforcement o principles that work in favor of peace and international security, t would be unfair to deny that the un has played an important role in bringing colonial sm to an end, promoting hu an 2 rights, boosting inte ational development d cooperation, and management nd control of the ho spots of i stability worldwide. despite the progress made so far, we need to ackno ledge the old prevailing conflicts yet to be solved, such as the israel-palestine conflict in the middle east, the resolution of which will only be achieved through a solution based on two-states l ving side by side peacef lly, as advocated by the united nations and the over elming majority of its member states. we welcome the endeavors t at ave been made by the united states of a erica.. north korea and south korea, it the contribution of the people's republic of china towards the de uclearization of tire korean pe insula, ich has considerably eased the e isti g tensions that threatened to trigger a nuclear conflict that would likely be angerous not o ly to that region but to international securit in general. with the end of the so-called cold war, symbolized by the fall of the berlin wall i 1989, the momentary e ergence of a new political, paradigm oriented toward multilateralism, t e united nations volunteered to retake its action guided towards building a eaceful o ld order. we do believe that with hard work from all of us we will be able to achieve such a goal. today, in a time of ever-increasing globalization, there is no justification for the continued proliferation of conflicts apparently without a solution, of various dimensions in several parts of the orld, and t at entire populations continue suffering from their tragic consequences, virtually abandoned to their fate. therefore, there have been m ny voices demanding, profound reforms inside the united nations organization, which is abreast of the new realities, whe eby the emergence of new centers of econo ic and financial power, and technological and scientific advancements do fully justify the redefinition of its structures and intervention mechanis as well as the enlargement and refo m of its security council in order to better represent the different geo-political regions of the lanet. 3 your majesties. excellencies. ladies and gentlemen, the political setup of the contemporary world, where local, regional and intra-state conflict represent international tensions and threats to peace, demands that the united nations organizations play an increasi giy-active role in promoting and monitoring political, so ial and economic democracy building processes. this is the optimal avenue for a solution to the inte al, ethnic, religious and inter-state co flic s arisi g in most cases fro authoritarianism, e clusion, intolerance, radicalism, or interference in inter al affairs of sovereign states. the current proportions of nte ational terrorism, t ansnational organized crime, ille al immigration, xenophobia, human trafficking an drug trafficking and other evils affect the qual ty of life of the inhabitants of the planet and demand coordination at the highest level b all member states of our organization, this 73rd session of the uni ed nations ge eral assembly is being held under the theme making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies"". therefore, the un should give priority to the pro otion a d safeguard of human needs, and strive to solve humanity s global problems such as those pertaining to security, the environment, economic inequalities and development in order to ensure that global peace is reserved. our plea is that we should adopt a decentralized scheme for the global financial system, based both on promotion of trade and regional economic integration systems, and the enhancement of regional financial institutions in such ter s that allow for more sustainable economic develop ent. your majesties, la ie and gentlemen, 4 throughout our history as an independent country, our collaboration with the un has always been permanent in that it has allowed us today to be engaged not only in the re-launch of our economy, but also in the search for solutions for effective peace, democracy buildin and development in southern and central african regions. the republic of angola hereby expresses its willingness to continue supporting all efforts to promote cooperation among the natio s of the whole world, consolidate peace and defense for cooperation, trade and investment relations at the bilateral and multilateral levels. thank you ver much for your attention. 5","joão manuel gonçalves lourenço, president of angola, said that the role of the united nations was decisive for the achievement of a long‑lasting peace in angola through the united nations angola verification mission (unavem iii) and united nations observer mission in angola (monua) peace missions, and also commended the work undertaken by united nations children’s fund (unicef) and the world food program (wfp). angola’s experience in peacebuilding and reconciliation between the warring forces has been a positive example for the united nations, in the sense that it has allowed for the drawing of useful conclusions on how to approach peace processes in other regions of the world. it is at the united nations where the best solutions can be found to the current, serious problems and conflicts that may hinder the survival of humanity itself, and are discussed and resolved, he continued. those include hunger and misery that affect millions of citizens around the world, as well as global warming and its consequences, mass migrations, trafficking in narcotics, human trafficking, religious intolerance and extremism, and the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons, among other issues. the united nations is still far from achieving the goals enshrined in its charter. he underscored that, while it is true that, after the establishment of the united nations, the bipolarization of the planet into two antagonistic political and economic systems did not contribute to the easy enforcement of principles that work in favor of international peace and security. however, it would be unfair to deny that the united nations has played an important role in bringing colonialism to an end, promoting human rights, boosting international development and cooperation, and the management and control of the hotspots of instability worldwide. despite the progress made so far, the old prevailing conflicts yet to be solved need to be acknowledged, he noted. those include the israel‑palestine conflict in the middle east, the resolution of which will only be achieved through a solution based on two states living side by side peacefully, as advocated by the united nations and the overwhelming majority of its member states. he welcomed the endeavors that had been made by the united states, democratic people’s republic of korea and the republic of korea, with the contribution of china, towards the denuclearization of the korean peninsula. this has considerably eased tensions. with the end of the so‑called cold war, there was a momentary emergence of a new political paradigm oriented towards multilateralism, he said. today, in a time of ever‑increasing globalization, there is no justification for the continued proliferation of conflicts apparently without a solution, with entire populations suffering from their tragic consequences. there have been many voices demanding profound reforms inside the united nations, including the enlargement and reform of the security council. such changes would ensure better representation of the different geopolitical regions of the planet."
Antigua and Barbuda,"statement by the honorable gaston a. browne mr prime minister of antigua and barbuda to the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly at the united nations headquarters in new york on friday, 28th september 2018 president of the general assembly secretary general excellencies, distinguished delegates year after year, government leaders from across the world, travel to this hall in the united nations organization, in the hope of finding a pathway to universal peace and progress, that has persistently eluded us all. the peoples of our nations - rich and poor, large and small - have long since stopped paying attention, or caring about what is said here. for them, this place is a talk shop where much is spoken, and not enough is being done to change their lives, or to give them good reason to believe that better is coming. what they know, is that they live in a world in which one percent of humanity, controls more wealth than the other 99 percent. what they see, is a world controlled by a few powerful nations, who impose their will on all others, in perpetuation of a system of sectional dominance. to the children of syria, palestine, israel, yemen and afghanistan, who do not know a life without war, without bombs, without conflicts and without violent confrontation; the promise of turning swords into plowshares is a meaningless phrase. to the people in sub-saharan africa, and many parts of latin america and asia, the world bank s dream, emblazoned at its grand entrance in washington, of a world free of poverty, continues to be a nightmare that they live in every waking moment. the fundamental undertaking by all nations set out in the charter of this body, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small , contradicts the reality of refugees from africa, from latin america, from war-torn countries, who are forced to flee their homelands to the borders of the rich - some, literally, in cages. so, why then did i too travel here? why am i standing at this podium, when i could be in my own country tending to its affairs and trying, as best i can, to the improvement of my people’s lives? i am here because none of the crises i just described exist in isolation. each of them engulfs us all. and, at least, in this forum, i can raise my voice for the disadvantaged and dispossessed, including my own people. history has taught us, that no nation should believe that its individual oasis of wealth, prosperity and advantage can continue to exist and expand, if the rest of the globe is a wasteland. 2 the world is a global neighborhood. no place on our plant is distant any longer, nor are the issues that plague it. the hopes and aspirations of these communities and, yes, their terrors, their torments and their fears are shared by everyone. and, if they have not yet reached your doorstep, at the rate we are going, they are coming soon. walls around the rich, can t keep-out diseases that are carried on the winds blowing from neglected pools of poverty. migrants will not halt their determined trek from their homelands in search of better conditions until circumstances in their own countries improve. and, while the governments and political parties in those countries bear a great responsibility to respect and uphold the human, civil and political rights of their citizens; the global community, particularly the rich, has an obligation to contribute to the economic development of those countries. for, human freedoms, like fragile plants, even in the purest air, cannot take root and thrive in conditions of deprivation and dispossession. for all these reasons, collectively our nations, acting in a united way, must act to improve the human condition. and that is why the revitalization of this un general assembly is vital, urgent and important. for instance, without the inclusion of all member states of the united nations in the discussions of global financial reforms, there can be no real comprehension of the grave vulnerability of small states to external shocks, high levels of poverty and high debt to gdp ratios. a few privileged nations are makin decisions that impact the livelihood of billions. the exclusive clubs of the g7 and g20 cannot repair the fragmented international financial system, without taking full account of the circumstances and views of the majority of the world s nations. nor can the commission of the european union, which now seeks to impose its own anti¬ competition, high tax policies on developing countries around the world. limits in participation, limits ideas, innovation and human development. arbitrary rules, set by unrepresentative bodies, for their own narrow purposes, have no legitimacy in the world. enforcement of those arbitrary rules by threat and sanctions of the mighty is not legitimate. it results only in gru bling and reluctant acquiescence that lacks enduring support. might by enforcers does not make their actions right. that is why this united nations general assembly must be revitalized. its revitalization would serve to give this gathering relevance, and to address meaningfully the indifference of the peoples of the world, about which i spoke at the beginning of this statement. 3 the special value of the general assembly is its universality of membership and the fact that the voice of every member state can be raised. but it must be seen to be more than a place for talk; it must be a place for action and for results. for years, the general assembly has been marginalized by the security council, and by the notion that a small group of powerful countries, should make decisions for the rest of the world. that erroneous thinking has crept into every multilateral organization. it is so in the world trade organization; it is so in the international monetary fund; it is so in the world bank. this united nations general assembly must become the principal organ of the united nations system - the only system which every nation of the world accepts and to which they all subscribe. that is what the united nations charter promised; it is what nations expect. the failure to deliver on that promise has undermined multi-lateralism, encouraged the abuse of power, and frustrated people all over the world. unless, the general assembly is revitalized and made relevant, the actions of the security council, and of other organizations, will be endured but not embraced; they will be accepted but not respected; they will be enforced but not legitimized. despite the risk of my call falling on deaf ears, i hereby make the call once again, for a reinvigorated and relevant un general assembly. i recognize that it would not serve the interests of the powerful, who fear the expression of dissent and the call for political rights, that many of them demand in other countries. but, i would be neglectful of my duty of care and responsibility to the poor and vulnerable, and to the silenced and stifled, if i did not raise this clarion call for greater and fairer representation for all the world s peoples. as the leader of my country, i put its interests first. however, i know that in standing-up for my country first, it would be foolhardy to stand-up for my country only. that would be a dog-eat-dog policy, which, if practiced by every nation, would result in short¬ term gains for the richer ones, but ultimate losses for all. my country would soon run-out of friends, run-out of foreign investors, and, more importantly, run-out of markets for its goods and services. and, the analogy applies to countries much larger than mine, even the richest and most powerful, even those who believe that they are invincible. for when they have weakened all others to strengthen themselves, to whom will they sell their goods and services and how will they maintain their high standard of living and increase their wealth? 4 humanity in itself is our global community, providing us all with enduring citizenship. loyalty to myopic, nationalistic ideals cannot trump patriotism to our common humanity. i recognize that, today, all nations of the world are interdependent in the effort to stop the spread of disease; to curb the effects of climate change; to make our people safe from terrorists and organized crime; to share knowledge and technology; and to have access to each other s markets to trade in goods and services, thereby improving the lives of all people. today s world will only maintain and broaden peace, security and prosperity by international teamwork. no one nation, however powerful, can go it alone. that is why my country supports denuclearization by north korea and iran. it is why we would like to see all countries halt their nuclear arsenals. global peace will not be won by a balance of terror. and, that is what pointing nuclear warheads at each other is all about - a balance of terror. it is a zero-sum game that is playing with the survival of our planet and all humanity. no one should be playing that game, no matter how rich or powerful. ooooo in my country’s own caribbean region, we strongly advocate a zone of peace. for too many centuries, our area has been the location of other peoples’ conflicts and ambitions. we had no say in those conflicts, which have left our region with a long shadow of stunted growth, dispossession and underdevelopment. we want no more to be the theater of proxy wars by others. we want the chance to grow and develop, to claim a place under the sun and to make our own unique contribution to human progress. for that reason, we welcome a recent visit to cuba by the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee of the united states, mr. bob corker, to talk about relations between the two countries. we understand that progress is never made in a straight line. there have been many zigs and zags. but after five decades of imposing a trade embargo on cuba, the senselessness of this policy should be obvious to all. it is time to end it, and to provide the cuban nation with the chance they have been so long denied, to put their well-known talents in medicine, in the arts, in music, in education at the disposal of all humanity. 5 we again call on the congress of the united states to abandon the outdated trade embargo of cuba, and to renew the avenues of dialog and cooperation that offer beneficial prospects for the peoples of both countries, and by extension, to all the americas. in the same vein, we urge all nations to recall that the countries of this united nations, thirteen years ago, committed themselves to the responsibility to protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. what we did not do was to give any country, or group of countries, the right to intervene, uninvited, in the affairs of any other country. we certainly did not authorize military intervention in any way, shape or form. what we agreed was a collective responsibility to encourage and help each country uphold its individual commitment to protect its own people. and, we declared our preparedness to take timely and decisive action, in accordance with the united nations charter, to help them to do so. we all know that, in the words of the charter itself, nothing contained in it shall authorize the united nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state . in this connection, when this 73rd general assembly once again discusses this matter, we must strongly discourage bellicose talk of military intervention in any state, by any other state, or group of states. the responsibility to protect must not be used as political cover for vigilante action, to justify intervention in any country. encouragement of military interventions would mortally wound the united nations as a legitimate and effective body. that is a prospect to be firmly eschewed. therefore, when, and if, the united nations decides that democracy and human rights have been emasculated by tyranny in any country, it is the united nations collectively, that must authorize and carry out any agreed action. in the words of former u.s. republican president, dwight eisenhower: if the united nations once admits that international disputes can be settled by using force, then we will have destroyed the foundation of the organization and our best hope of establishing a world order . oooooo this united nations must always be a manife tation of the better angels of our common humanity, through which we must seek a world of security and freedom, governed by justice and moral law. together, we must assert the pre-eminence of right over might and the general good over narrow sectional aims. 6 that is why my country calls for a renewed commitment to multilateralism and a rejection of trade wars. goods and services together represent 28 per cent of global gross domestic product. but, escalation of trade wars will lead to severe disruption across the globe. no country will be spared, and the worst affected will be those who wage these wars. that disruption has already started, and its effects are being felt globally. already, e en though my country is not involved in a trade war, it is experiencing the downside of trade wars between our trading partners, as prices of our imports from them rise, pushing-up our cost of living. the world trade organization (wto) is not a perfect mechanism for solving trade disputes, but walking away from it or tearing it down would do nothing except destabilize the world s trading system, that is fundamental to the well-being of all. it is up to all nations, rich and poor, to make the system work by improving it and by honoring their individual commitments. after 15 years of winning an arbitration at the wto, my little country is still awaiting an acceptable settlement by the united states, to honor its obligation to us. the us economy is 20,000 times larger than antigua and barbuda s. compensation for the injury to my small country is less than 0.008 percent of one year of the us’ gdp. the injury that was done to my country’s economy now amounts to over 20 per cent of its gdp. no country can easily absorb that severe blow which hurts our economy, sets back our infra tructural development, and constrains the provision of employment and advances in health and education. that my people survive that pain, speaks to their resilience of which i am very proud, but they should not be made to endure it. of course, the wto is powerless to enforce its own awards, and my country has no means to do so. we rely on respect for the international system, on adherence to international law, and on the conscience of the mighty, to do right to the weak they have injured. that is a struggle in which my country will continue to engage; not in anger and not in enmity, but in calm and in comity until justice is achieved. we owe it to our small island community, not to rest until justice is done. in the context of justice, the refusal by some countries, particularly, those that are the worst contributors to green house gas emissions, to admit to the harmful effects of climate change and to take remedial action, is an act of injustice. 7 small countries, such as antigua and barbuda, contribute the least to har ful carbon emissions less than 0.01 per cent. yet, along with other small states in the caribbean and the pacific, we are its greatest victims. the injury to our countries continues without compensation, causing our economies to decline; creating refugees within our own states; scaring away foreign investors; escalating the costs of insurance and rebuilding; and increasing the level of our debt. last year s hurricane season cost the caribbean region over 150 billion dollars. to put this in perspective the overall economy of the 14 member-states of the caribbean community (caricom) totals 80 billion dollars. this means that the damage to countries within our sub-region last year alone, was almost twice the size of all our economies combined. almost a year ago today, a caricom-un high level pledging conference was convened to assist caribbean countries that were affected by hurricanes irma and maria. billions of dollars were pledged, even though the pledges were insufficient to meet the costs. unfortunately, less than half the pledges have been delivered. reconstruction is far from done; rebuilding lives and livelihoods will challenge us for some time to come. the caribbean has been fortunate this year that we have, so far, survived the hurricane season. we watched in anguish and with enormous sympathy, the destruction wrought by hurricane florence on the carolinas in the united states. we mourned the loss of lives - a pain we know only too well. what the destruction of the carolinas this year, and the ruin of caribbean countries last year, emphasized to us, is that borders may separate nations, but they do not insulate them from the shared dangers of climate change. sovereignty and patriotism do not give sanctuary from calamity; disaster befalls the wealthy as well as the poor. that is why we continue to urge a global policy dialog that integrates environment with development and that accepts the fundamental understanding that every country - with no exception - must play a meaningful role, within its means, to stop the persistent deterioration of human life caused by climate change. the problem is global; the solution is global. what the world needs is a recommitment to the paris accord including committing to the replenishment of the green climate fund and the adaptation fund. on behalf of the people of my country, the people of the caribbean and pacific islands, the people who live in the eye of storms, such as those on the easte seaboard of the united states, 8 i urge all countries to come to the table of dialog, and to stand by the agreements we make and the treaties we sign. our shared planet, and our common humanity depends upon it. thank you. 9","gaston alphonso browne, prime minister of antigua and barbuda, emphasizing that a few privileged nations are making decisions that impact the lives of billions of people, said the general assembly must be revitalized to become a place for action and results. for years, it has been marginalized by the security council and the notion that a small group of powerful nations should make decisions for the rest of the world. until the assembly is made relevant, the actions of the council and other organizations will be endured but not embraced, accepted but not respected, and enforced but not legitimized. he said that, as leader of antigua and barbuda, he puts its interests first. however, it would be foolhardy to stand up only for his country. such a dog‑eat‑dog policy, if practiced by every nation, would result in short‑term gains for rich countries and, ultimately, losses for all. “loyalty to myopic, nationalistic ideals cannot trump patriotism to our common humanity,” he said, emphasizing that peace, security and prosperity can only be achieved through international teamwork. he called for the caribbean to be recognized as a zone of peace, stating that for too many centuries, it has been a place for other people’s conflicts and ambitions. “we want no more to be the theater of proxy wars by others,” he said. welcoming the recent visit to havana by the chair of the united states senate foreign relations committee, he said it is time for the united states congress to lift the trade embargo, thus putting cuba’s talents in medicine, the arts, music and education at the disposal of all humanity. he went on to say that when the assembly debates the responsibility to protect, bellicose talk of military intervention must be discouraged. when the united nations decides that democracy and human rights are emasculated by tyranny, then it must collectively agree upon the action to be taken. turning to trade, he said the wto is not perfect, but walking away from it or breaking it down will only destabilize the global trading system. fifteen years after winning a wto arbitration case, he added, his country still awaits compensation from the united states. injury to small island developing states in the caribbean and pacific due to climate change is continuing without compensation, causing their economies to decline, creating internal refugees, scaring away investment, escalating insurance costs and increasing debt levels, he said. with donors having delivered less than half of the pledges they made after hurricanes irma and maria, reconstruction is far from complete. “the problem is global and the solution is global,” he said, urging a global policy dialog integrating environment with development on the fundamental understanding that every country must do its part to combat climate change."
Argentina,,"mauricio macri, president of argentina, said his country is a trustworthy partner, seeking to make a positive impact on the twenty-first century and committed to implementing a range of measures aimed at enhancing peace, democracy and human rights. raising several regional and global concerns, he said the human rights situation in venezuela is worrisome, adding that argentina will refer allegations of human rights violations to the international criminal court and will, as part of a regional response, host those fleeing venezuela, providing them with needed services. on security matters, he regretted to note that organized crime, cybercrime and terrorism continue to be grave threats that require a collective response. as such, argentina is working with partners on initiatives to combat drug trafficking and stamp out organized crime. highlighting recent terrorist attacks in argentina, he said the government is working to bring to justice those responsible. calling on iran to cooperate with buenos aires to advance the investigation on argentina’s most brutal terrorist attack, he also asked friendly nations to provide needed information about the perpetrators. on fostering a strategic vision of the south atlantic ocean, he raised the question of malvinas*. affirming the legitimate right of argentina to the malvinas islands, south georgia islands and south sandwich islands and the surrounding maritime areas, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to maintaining a relationship with the united kingdom based on mutual trust. as a strong advocate for multilateralism, he reiterated a commitment to tackling climate change challenges, expressing strong support for the paris agreement and the 2030 agenda. also committed to strengthening global governance, he said argentina will host a conference on south‑south cooperation and will preside over the forthcoming treaty on the non‑proliferation of nuclear weapons review conference. as the international community faces challenges, he pledged argentina’s commitment to sustainable peace."
Armenia,"statement by the prime minister of the republic of armenia h.e. nikol pashinyan at the general debate of the session of the un general assembly september 25, 2018 distinguished president of the general assembly, excellences, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, i would like to congratulate her excellency maria fernanda espinosa garces upon her election as the president of the 73^^ session of the general assembly and wish us fruitful deliberations under her able leadership. ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to address you as a leader, who has recently become the prime minister of armenia as a result of people's revolution, which is now known as the armenian velvet revolution. i would like to take a minute to share the story of our victory over the authoritarian rule. the people of armenia succeeded in unpredicted and unprecedented revolution, without any violence, any victims or public disorder. and it was not a coincidence. our intention was to make a revolution of love and solidarity. from the very beginning, we declared that we ruled out any violence. we declared that, even if violence was used against us, we would not respond with violence. we declared that our response would be with raised and open hands, smile and love. when we started this political process, there were only dozens of us marching from the second biggest city of armenia, gyumri to the capital yerevan. when we reached yerevan, and showed our determination and devotion to the principle of non violence, our entire nation rose against the ruling regime, in unity and solidarity. and we won without a single shot and without any victims only through the peaceful demonstrations. we succeeded against all expectations: even well-known experts and thinktanks were skeptical about our victory. against all odds, i was elected prime minister. i was elected in a parliament, where i had only four reliable votes, including my own. yet it was possible. it happened, because people were firm in their demand and the parliament, elected just a year ago, had no other choice than to follow the people's will. today, that parliament continues to work, however it does not represent our people's will, as it was not before and during the revolution. why is it so? the answer is short. because it was elected through the elections with massive vote buying process and use of administrative resources and oppression. an important test for holding genuinely free and fair and competitive elections was the yerevan city council election which took place just before my departure to new york. the fact that all the candidates for the first time since armenia's independence congratulated the winning candidate, speaks about the establishment of a completely new political culture in armenia. in the same spirit we are now getting ready for snap parliamentary elections in armenia. free, fair and transparent elections will become an irreversible reality in armenia and will bring strong and vibrant democratic institutions, the functioning system of checks and balances. protecting our citizens' rights and ensuring freedom of speech, expression and assembly is very high on our government's agenda. from now on, there will be no possibility to manipulate the electoral process and undermine the trust of citizens. i would also like to stress that the current situation in armenia is not just a change of a government or a ruling party. it is an establishment of a new political and governance system, which we name people's direct rule and people's direct governance. in order to institutionalize this system we intend to guarantee expression of the people's will not only through elections, but also through local and national referenda, to engage our people into the decision-making process. having been a political prisoner myself, i do understand how significant it is to be able to speak out and decide your own future. having assumed the responsibility, our team has a clear vision and strong political will to launch fundamental reforms aimed at eradicating corruption, creating transparent, accountable and efficient governance, safeguarding human rights and the rule of law, ensuring independence of judiciary and advancing economic growth through a free and competitive business environment and a favorable atmosphere for investments. madam president, despite the radical transformations in the internal political life, our foreign policy agenda does not have u-tums. the continuity of armenia's foreign policy depicts armenia as a predictable and reliable partner. our international commitments are not subject to revision. our position is clear - armenia stands ready to have a constructive dialog and cooperation with all partners. however, we do not intend to develop our relations with one partner at the expense of another. we underline the role of multilateralism on global and regional levels. armenia's cooperation under the umbrella of the united nations is both comprehensive and vibrant. without entering into all the details, let me mention our contribution to the global peace imder the auspices of the un led and un supported peace operations in an impressive geographical scope that extends from afghanistan to lebanon, kosovo and mali. this has a particular importance to our country: while itself facing serious security concerns, it realizes that the security of one country is inseparably linked to that of all others, and that the global peace requires concerted actions. 2 we have a truly global nation with hundreds of communities all around the world. hence comes the sensitivity of armenia to the global threats that may put our fellow armenians at risk in different parts of the world. the sizable armenian community in syria faces an existential threat from the ongoing crisis. armenia has tried to contribute through dispatching humanitarian assistance to most vulnerable regions. we stand ready to enhance armenia's humanitarian mission aimed at meeting the most pressing needs of our community in syria. as a nation that has passed through the horrors of genocide, armenians have higher security consciousness when it comes to our fellow people and are ready to do their utmost for their protection. madam president, the peaceful resolution of the nagorno-karabakh conflict continues to prevail our foreign policy agenda. the status and security of the republic of artsakh is an absolute priority of the republic of armenia in the negotiation process. any attempt to resolve the conflict through military means represents a direct threat to the regional security, democracy and human rights. armenia will continue its constructive engagement in the peaceful resolution of the conflict within the format of the osce minsk group co-chairs, which has the only internationally recognized mandate to deal with the conflict azerbaijan should change its behavior of disrespect towards the negotiations and abandon the idea of any military solution and implement all the previous agreements. furthermore, if azerbaijan is truly committed to the peace process it should start talking to the main subject of this conflict - nagorno-karabakh. azerbaijan declares on every occasion that karabakh should be a part of its territory. at the same time it announces that it will not negotiate with nagorno karabakh. the question is how azerbaijan can make a claim over nagorno-karabakh without even speaking to nk? is that possible? this is possible only if azerbaijani government wants the territory and not the people. thus, it becomes obvious that the intention of azerbaijani leadership is to cleanse armenians from karabakh, like they did in nakhijevan. this entitles nagorno-karabakh to make the argument, that to be a part of azerbaijan for karabakh means to be totally exterminated. hence karabakh must not be a part of azerbaijan, unless one wants to trigger a new genocide of armenian people. summing up, let me reiterate: the conflict can and should be settled only through mutual compromises by all sides, in an atmosphere conducive to peace and not war. last but not least; let me also express my satisfaction to the secretary general of the united nations for his unwavering support to the efforts and approaches of the osce minsk group co-chairmanship madam president, the topic of our deliberations ""making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies"" demonstrates our consistent approach to the agenda 2030 and the sustainable development goals. indeed, the united nations and its development agenda should be relevant and accessible for all. no one should be left behind as we keep repeating in our collective efforts. earlier in july this year, armenia presented its first voluntary national report on the implementation of the sustainable development goals at the high level political forum. this important exercise coincided with the decisive political period determined by vibrant democratic processes and the launch of a wide-range of reforms. armenia is committed to the creation and development of knowledge-based and innovative platforms that will leverage the impact and accelerate the implementation of the development agenda. in this regard, we recognize the indispensable role of the un and its specialized agencies as well as the role of the cooperation with other potential partners. as a newly-elected member of the ecosoc and a candidate for the human rights council for the term 2020-22 armenia will do its utmost to contribute to the realization of sustainable development goals and to protection and promotion of human right sand fundamental freedoms. ladies and gentlemen, 2018 is the year when we will mark the 70^ anniversary of two of the most important human rights documents - the universal declaration of human rights and the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. each of these documents has its own history and each of them has become a cornerstone for the development of international law. they served as a basis for armenia to start the series of global forum sessions against the crime of genocide. this year it will be dedicated to the issues of genocide prevention through education, culture and museums. i encourage you to bring your contribution to the work of the forum. ladies and gentlemen, mesdames et monsieur « vivre ensemble » est le theme du 17®™® sommet de i'organization internationale de la francophonie qui va se tenir en octobre prochain a erevan, capitale armenienne, agee de deux-mille-huit-cents ans. c'est un grand honneur et un privilege pour tarmenie de faire partie de la grande famille francophone, de promouvoir la tolerance et le respect mutuel a travers la cooperation dans le domaine de la culture, de i'education et de i'innovation. je reitere une nouvelle fois nos invitations au sommet de la francophonie avec plusieurs manifestations prevues dans le meme cadre. thank you.","nikol pashinyan, prime minister of armenia, first took a moment to share the story of victory over the authoritarian rule during his country’s “velvet revolution”. the people of armenia succeeded in an unprecedented revolution, without any violence. this was not a coincidence, he noted, and said: “our intention was to make a revolution of love and solidarity. from the very beginning we declared that we ruled out any violence,” he said. “our response would be with raised and open hands, smiles and love.” he noted that when starting out the political process, there were only dozens marching from the second biggest city, gyomri, to the capital yerevan. upon reaching yerevan and showing determination and devotion to non-violence, the entire nation rose against the ruling regime, winning without a single victim or gunshot, only through peaceful demonstrations. “against all odds, i was elected prime minister,” he said, adding that it was possible because people were firm in their demand that the parliament had to follow the people’s will. he said that today, however, that parliament does not represent our people’s will as it was elected through massive vote buying and oppression. “free, fair and transparent elections will become an irreversible reality in armenia,” he said. he noted the establishment of a new governance system, which is named people’s direct rule, something that will be institutionalized through elections, referendums and engagement of people in the decision-making process. despite the radical transformations in internal political life, the foreign policy agenda does not have u-turns, he continued. armenia stands ready to have constructive dialog with all partners. he noted the armenian community in syria that faces an existential threat from the ongoing crisis, and that his country has contributed humanitarian assistance. the peaceful resolution of the nagorno-karabakh conflict continues to prevail, and the status of the republic of artsakh is a priority, he said. he noted that armenia will continue constructive engagement in a peaceful resolution. summing up, he noted that the conflict can be settled through mutual compromises by all sides."
Australia,"australian mission to the united nations e-maii austraiia@un.int 150 east 42nd street, new york ny 10017-5612 ph 212 - 351 6600 fax 212 - 351 6610 www.australia-unsc.gov.; united nations general assembly friday 28 september 2018 general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly statement by senator the hon marise payne minister for foreign affairs of australia () mr president we are all proud members of this venerable institution. if this place, and our membership of it, stand for anything, then we stand for an international order based on rules and cooperation. this principle guides our actions, our dealings with each other, and our treatment of collective challenges as they arise before us. australia recognizes the reality of a world in which the power of great states shapes the international system in which we seek to advance our national interests. that is the grain with which we all work. ! ; equally, we hold true to this simple proposition - we will be safer and more prosperous in a world where global differences are managed, and global challenges met, by agreed rules rather than by the exercise of power alone. ¦ strong global cooperation sets a tone, and sets in place rules and norms, for constructive diplomacy in every region of the world. this is true even in a period of rapid and accelerating change, and it is true even in a period of rising nationalism and geo-political competition. none of our most urgent global challenges can be solved by countries acting alone. solutions begin with collaboration. in australia s 2017 foreign policy white paper, we set out an analysis of the trends that are shaping the world. most importantly, we set out our policy response. in a more competitive and contested era, australia is taking responsibility for our own security and prosperity. at home, we are investing in our national resilience and strength, ensuring our economy is strong and australians are safe. we are sovereign and independent. in our region - the indo-pacific - we seek a neighborhood in which the rights of all states are respected and adherence to rules delivers lasting peace. 2 internationally, we are committed to promoting and protecting the rules and institutions that support stability and prosperity, and enable collective action to meet global challenges. challenges mr president, at this time of change, challenge and opportunity, we member state representatives have the honor of preserving and advancing international rules and order, to deliver on the expectations of our people for a just, fair, and secure world. one proof of the necessity of the united nations is the hard fact that we cannot with all confidence rid the world of nuclear weapons today or this year. given this reality, we must redouble our efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation, and to build the international trust and confidence necessary to move towards a world free of nuclear weapons. our peoples expect us to continue to work towards verifiable nuclear disarmament with sound compliance, safeguards and enforcement regimes. overwhelmingly, our peoples expect us to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons. to do this, we must continue to build on the progress we have made through the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 3 for this reason, australia supports the joint comprehensive plan of action on iran s nuclear program, as long as iran abides by its commitments. it is in our collective interests that controls on iran's nuclear program remain in place. and for this reason, the world observes the negotiations between the united states and north korea, pursuing complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the peninsula, in accordance with un resolutions. australia will also continue to fully implement our obligations under the united nations security council and maintain our own autonomous sanctions while awaiting progress towards denuclearisation. further, we ha e most recently witnessed a new pattern of indiscriminate slaughter through the use of chemical weapons, including the weaponisation of toxic industrial chemicals such as chlorine. we have collectively agreed that the use of chemical weapons anytime, anywhere, and under any circumstances is unjustifiable and unacceptable. as member states, we must defend our long-standing prohibition on the use of chemical weapons, and abide by our collective right and resolve to investigate allegations, and to verify this prohibition. australia joins those calling for syria to cease the use of chemicals as weapons. australia also continues to urge russia, and all nations, to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons anywhere. 4 mr president, australia like the united nations is committed to improving humanitarian ass stance in fragile settings. i commend the secretary general for establishing the united for gender parity initiative, and for declaring zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse. australia is also a robust and strong contributor to the un s women peace and security agenda, first set out in un security council resolution 1325. australia was one of the first member states to draw up a national action plan on women peace and security, and we are continuing work on our next five year national action plan. examples of our work on this issue include a benchmark of a minimum of 15 per cent of female military members deployed on australian peacekeeping mission teams, which i was proud to support and to work to see grow over the past three years in my previous role as australia's minister for defense. australia also has active training programs on women peace and security in afghanistan, iraq, and the philippines, where our military is assisting partner forces to deal with counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency challenges. australia firmly believes that it is only through the inclusion of women in all aspects of peace and security initiatives, including negotiations, the design of peace processes, and the management and enforcement of peace programs, that lasting and resilient security can be achie ed. 5 mr president, many here will remember my predecessor and friend julie bishop s determined and sustained work pursuing accountability for the downing of malaysia airlines flight mh17. australia remains resolutely committed to this objective, and we will continue working with our joint investigation team partners to pursue justice for the victims and their loved ones. in expecting other member states to abide by international rules, we must also subject ourselves to those same standards and expectations. australia and timor-leste signed a new maritime boundaries treaty here in new york on 6 march this year. the treaty was the successful result of the first-ever compulsory conciliation initiated under the united nations convention on the law of the sea. the treaty underscores australia's commitment to international law, and is testament to the way in which international law, in particular the un convention on the law of the sea, enables countries to resolve disputes peacefully and properly, abiding by the rules. the conciliation process created the space for compromise and negotiation on what i acknowledge was a previously intractable disagreement, and ultimately strengthened bilateral relations. 6 mr president, when member states work together to uphold international law and the institutions that support it, the benefits accrue to all alike: the powerful and the weak, the large and the small. this is a long-standing principle we share, regardless of our culture, language, religion or political system: we are all equal before the law. our region mr president, australia particularly welcomes the active engagement of the un in our region, the indo-pacific. it is a youthful and dynamic region which has experienced an economic transformation in recent decades that is unprecedented in human history. the region s rising prosperity has been built on a foundation of stability. australia is absolutely committed to ensuring that the fundamental principles which have enabled the region's success are maintained. we are committed to a region in which the rights of all states are respected. a region characterized by respect for international law and other norms, and where disputes are resolved peacefully. and a region in which open markets facilitate the free flow of trade, capital and ideas. to achieve these outcomes australia is strengthening our indo-pacific bilateral relations, because they are among our most important in their 7 own right and because strong bilateral relations help support our regional goals. our aid program is an important mechanism through which we support the aspirations of our neighbors. it is predominately and unashamedly focused on the indo-pacific region and geared to expand opportunities for people, business and communities to promote economic growth and further reduce regional poverty. we work in sectors that drive economic growth and human development, including aid for trade, infrastructure, education and health, and empowering women and girls. and we work in ways that are most effective, including with un resident coordinators, and through the region s political, security and economic architecture. asean mr president, asean sits at the heart of the region. it is the collective voice of southeast asia. a vital piece of that regional architecture. there are good reasons why australia is asean's longest standing dialog partner. we are both committed to driving continued strong regional economic growth and we share optimism for the future. at the same-time we share a conviction to tackle head on the security challenges of our region, including the fight against terrorism. 8 as the convener for more than 50 years of the indo-pacific s most important diplomatic architecture, particularly the east asia summit, asean plays a vital role in the security, stability and prosperity of the indopacific. australia s interests are well served by asean and our commitment to its continued effectiveness and success is stronger than ever. this commitment was there for all to see at an asean-australia special summit, held in sydney in march this year. the summit marked a new era in the strategic partnership between asean and australia. leaders issued the sydney declaration, which comprehensively sets out asean and australia s shared commitment to work together towards a more secure and prosperous region. apec in other key pieces of regional architecture, the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum, or apec, seeks to build upon the growing interdependence of the asia-pacific's 21 member economies. the apec meeting in papua new guinea in november will be an important further opportunity to foster cooperation and economic activity across borders, to the mutual benefit of all. i commend papua new guinea on the work it has done to host apec 2018, and look forward in particular to a successful leaders' week later this year. 9 i also commend the republic of nauru for its successful hosting of the 49th pacific islands forum in the first week of september. with the theme of building a strong pacific: our islands, our people, our will , the member states, associate members, observers and dialog partners of the pacific islands forum secretariat continued the long tradition of amity, consultation, partnership and policy development on diverse matters of climate change, economic reform, transport and trade. australia is committed to working with member states, and un resident coordinators, to strengthen resilience to climate change and natural disasters in the pacific. in all of this, the un development program is a vital partner. australia recognizes that pacific island countries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and disaster, and that this is a leading priority for the region. the pacific islands forum boe declaration, released last month at the meeting by member states, takes a comtemporary view of security inclusive of human and environmental security and emphasizes the importance of regional cooperation and collaboration in building resilience to disasters and climate change. mr president, australia seeks a region that promotes accountability and respects international law for the benefit of all nations. in 2018 we joined the fluman rights council for the first time. 10 australia has been a strong supporter of the independent international fact-finding mission on myanmar, and we have been deeply disturbed by its findings. we are working with myanmar and with asean and regional partners to find long-term solutions to this crisis, including with indonesia as co-chairs of the bali process and through joint humanitarian efforts in cox s bazar. australia will continue to work with the myanmar government and the international community towards a long-term and durable resolution of the nation's complex problems. after 50 years of isolation and instability, myanmar is at critical stage in its democratic and economic transition, and it is in all our interests to ensure it succeeds. let us honor the late secretary-general kofi annan by renewing our efforts to see fully and genuinely implemented the recommendations of the advisory commission on rakhine state, which he led. conclusion mr president, international institutions, and the united nations in particular, help us to adapt collectively as our world changes around us. but as the secretary general noted when he opened the general assembly trust in global governance is also fragile, as 21st-century challenges outpace 20th-century institutions and mindsets . 11 this is why australia supports the secretary general s work to reform the un. we need to work together to keep pace with the needs and aspirations of the people we serve. but to remain fit for our times, the united nations must remain true to the founding principles, the universal rights and obligations, we agreed upon when we first came together as member states. chief among these is the sovereign equality of all states. member states must re-dedicate themselves to the aspirations of the founders of the united nations, and take to heart the charter, so that our world is a more just, fair and secure place to live. end 12","marise payne, minister for foreign affairs of australia, said that at a time of rapid change, rising nationalism and geopolitical competition, solutions to urgent global challenges begin with collaboration. with that in mind, australia drafted a white paper in 2017 analyzing trends and setting out its policy response, including taking responsibility for its security and prosperity and investing in national resilience and strength while working with regional and global actors. citing many challenges requiring concerted action, she said ridding the world of nuclear weapons is a priority. australia supports non-proliferation progress, including the iran nuclear agreement and developments on the korean peninsula. pointing at a new pattern of chemical weapon use, she called on syria to cease deploying those arms and urged the russian federation and all nations to reinforce the ban on such substances. she commended the secretary-general for his gender parity initiatives and for declaring zero-tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse. highlighting that australia was among the first member states to draft a national action plan on women, peace and security, she said achievements include reaching a minimum of 15 per cent of female military members deployed on peacekeeping mission teams. indeed, lasting and resilient security can only be achieved by including women in all aspects of peace and security initiatives, she said. providing examples of regional cooperation and working together towards common goals, she said australia is actively engaged with partners in the investigation of the downing of malaysia airlines flight mh17 and has signed a new maritime boundaries treaty with timor-leste. the government is also strengthening bilateral relations in the indo-pacific region and supporting neighboring countries with aid programs that drive economic growth and human development. an active partner with the association of southeast asian nations (asean) and regional forums, australia seeks a region that promotes accountability and respects international law for the benefit of all countries, she said, expressing support for united nations reform. “we need to work together to keep pace with the needs and aspirations of the people we serve,” she added."
Austria,,"karin kneissl, federal minister for europe, integration and foreign affairs of austria, speaking in arabic, french, spanish and english, described multilateralism as a sophisticated form of diplomacy. she warned against favoring fine statements over action, losing contact with reality and losing the meaning of an exchange of views. all too often, multilateralism fades into a flurry of meetings that some rich diplomats turn into a comfortable game, with hackneyed arguments about conflict zones where people are just trying to survive. that is why austria, with other countries, will contribute to mine clearance in syria and increase its humanitarian commitment to yemen. condemning the use of chemical weapons in syria and elsewhere, and rejecting biological weapons, she said there is no reason not to categorially ban the production and use of chemical weapons. noting the fiftieth anniversary of the treaty on the non‑proliferation of nuclear weapons (npt), which has suffered from inadequate implementation, she said disarmament treaties are not a moral matter, but a legal issue. genuine progress must be made on the path to nuclear disarmament, with ratification of the comprehensive nuclear‑test‑ban treaty being of paramount importance. describing her country as a steadfast supporter of the international criminal court, she welcomed the extension of the crime of aggression to its jurisdiction but regretted that its work is undermined by non‑surrender agreements. noting that the joint comprehensive plan of action was negotiated in vienna, she said its preservation is a matter of respecting international agreements and, in the end, a matter of international security. mutual trust is weakened if one of its parties walks away from it unilaterally. emphasizing austria’s focus on the women, peace and security agenda, the political and economic empowerment of women and the fight against gender‑based violence, she said multilateralism has failed millions of women around the world. the international community must stand up against female genital mutilation. turning to the middle east, she said the collapse of the ottoman empire created a new map of the region based on pipelines, with recent wars fought in the name of oil. syria is the victim of instability created by those wars, she said, emphasizing that it is time for courageous steps towards a diplomatic solution. in that regard, she encouraged decision‑makers from washington to moscow, via tehran, jerusalem, ankara and damascus, to seize the momentum, for which there is no alternative."

nations general assembly 'making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies "" new yorkf 28 september 2018 madame president, ladies and gentlemen, i am pleased to congratulate ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her assumption of the presidency of the general assembly as the fourth-ever woman being elected for this highly responsible position and to wish her every success in discharging her important duties. ms. espinosa may count on full support of azerbaijan during her tenure. we are also grateful to h.e. mr. miroslav lajcak for his tremendous work in presiding over the assembly during the seventysecond session. i express my profound respect and gratitude to the secretary-general of the united nations h.e. mr. antonio guterres for his dedicated leadership and efforts aimed at improving the efficiency of the organization. taking this opportunity, i would also like to pay tribute to former secretary general kofi annan - ""a man of peace"". his legacy will remain as true inspiration for all of us. madame president, the theme of this year's general debates is very timely and embodies the issues of utmost significance for all of us. we live in a globalized world where interactions between people representing different national societies are only getting more intense and more extensive. azerbaijan fully supports the secretary general's determination to genuinely contribute to preventing wars and sustaining peace, as well as his efforts towards responding early and effectively to conflicts and crises, assisting member states in their endeavors to sustain peace and build resilient and prosperous societies and making the united nations more coherent, integrated, effective and efficient. as we embark upon a path of implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, we need to regularly test ourselves to identify the extent to which we are delivering on our commitments. coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities among states backed by adequate resources are essential to secure sustainable future and ensure that no one is left behind. azerbaijan has adapted its national development strategy taking into account the sdgs, and continues to implement large-scale programs on improving good governance, sustainable growth, strengthening the rule of law, ensuring respect for human rights, providing facilitated access to public services, and promoting inclusive societies. we continue to consistently undertake efforts aimed at promoting the living conditions of our citizens. the level of poverty in the country equals to 5.4 percent, while the unemployment rate is at the level of 5 percent. davos world economic forum ranks azerbaijan number 35 with respect to competitiveness. among the developing countries azerbaijan is number three with respect to inclusive development index. azerbaijan contributes to regional development efforts through promoting connectivity. it plays an important role in bringing together continents, creating a platform for mutually beneficial cooperation. east-west transportation corridor was inaugurated in october 2017. it is a transportation corridor which saves at least two weeks of time for transporting goods from asia to europe and vice versa. other important projects are south-north and south-west corridors, which, as a result of our efforts together with neighboring countries, become reality. azerbaijan invests largely on these corridors and is an active participant of both initiatives. the first phase of the construction of baku international sea trade port complex was put into operation in may 2018. the handling capacity of the port will be 15 million tons of cargo per year with opportunity to increase it up to 25 million tons. azerbaijan also initiated transnational broadband project, namely trans-eurasian information super highway (tasim), which aims to build a trans-national fiber-optic line between hong kong and frankfurt. it will be the shortest line connecting east and west in the era of competition where every single second is important. today, azerbaijan offers its own development model to the world, backed by internal stability, civil unity and solidarity in society, and an environment ofpeace and tolerance among the different peoples and religions living together in a liberal, sustainable and dynamic economy. inspired by its achievements in economic development, successful social policy, rich human capital and traditional values of multiculturalism, azerbaijan decided to nominate its capital - the city of baku - for hosting the world expo2025. our theme - ""developing human capital, building a better future"" - is ofuniversal concern and has a particular significance for azerbaijan. it is also fully aligned with the international development agenda, in particular^ the un agenda for sustainable development. the whole region ofeastern europe, caucasus and caspian has never hosted world expos. in that sense. world expo 2025 baku shall be truly universal in terms of expansion of its traditional geography and vivid example that through historically short time period of 27 years of independence the countries like azerbaijan can achieve remarkable results for applying to the huge 2 events like world expo. availing myself of this opportunity, i kindly ask the member states of the bureau of international exhibitions to vote for baku at the elections to be held in paris late in november this year. sustainable economic growth has enabled azerbaijan not only to focus on its national development strategy, but also to actively support the international development efforts. azerbaijan has rendered international humanitarian and development assistance to a number of countries through the heydar aliyev foundation and azerbaijan international development agency (aida) under the ministry of foreign affairs. particular attention has been paid to addressing the needs of the developing and least developed countries, as well as those recovering from natural disasters. madame president, as thisyear wearecelebrating the 70^'' anniversary of the un human rights declaration, we wish to reaffirm our commitment to strengthening democracy and protecting human rights as top priorities of the republic of azerbaijan. the government implements large-scale programs to create necessary conditions for all the citizens of azerbaijan to fully enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms. education is a top priority in our domestic policy, because a well-established educated society is one of the guarantees of successful and sustainable development. the right to health is fully ensured in the country. every year more than 5 million people - half of the country's population - have their medical check-ups totally financed from the state budget. azerbaijan has been the first country in the muslim world granting women the right to vote as early as in 1918. azerbaijan strives to ensure gender equality and empower women in public and social life. since we live in a digital age, it is worth noting that currently about 80 percent of the country's population have unimpeded access to internet, which has become the most favored and practical vehicle for information, media communication and free flow of ideas and thoughts. combating corruption lies at the heart of sdg implementation in azerbaijan. application of innovative approaches and technological innovations has enabled azerbaijan to register significant progress in curbing corruption at the public sector. earlier this year, the un human rights council has unanimously adopted a resolution on ""promoting human rights and sdgs through transparent, accountable and efficient public services delivery"" initiated by azerbaijan which aimed to promote the concept of asan public service delivery brand of azerbaijan. earlier in may, azerbaijan has successfully presented its periodic report in the framework of the third cycle of the universal periodic review. we remain committed to enhanced dialog and interaction with other un human rights mechanisms on the basis of mutual respect and understanding. azerbaijan is one of the world's recognized centers of multiculturalism. all ethnic and religious groups live in azerbaijan in peace and harmony. we have hosted numerous international events aimed at strengthening intercultural dialog. being a member of both the organization of islamic cooperation and the council of europe, azerbaijan launched the baku process in 2008, the main goal of which is to strengthen dialog, partnership and cooperation between the muslim world and europe. implemented under the patronage ofazerbaijani leadership, the baku process provides large-scale platform for the exchange of knowledge on interreligious and intercultural dialog. in his most recent report on the promotion of a culture of peace, interreligious and intercultural dialog the secretary general specifically mentioned the important role of the baku process in advocating for 3 dialog among cultures. this year marks the 10'*^ anniversary of the baku process, and a series of events will beorganized onthis occasion, including the high-level 6'*^ humanitarian forum on 25-26 october 2018 in baku. madame president, from this podium, i am pleased to announce that azerbaijan is going to take over the chairmanship of the non-aligned movement next year. throughout its history the non-alignment movement has played a fundamental role in strengthening international peace and security by promoting adherence to the bandung principles. the chairmanship of azerbaijan will provide another impetus for advancing the founding principles of the movement, the 65^*^ anniversary of which will becelebrated in 2020. madame president, unresolved armed conflicts, existing and emerging security challenges and related humanitarian crises threaten to reverse much of the development progress. the ongoing armed conflict between armenia and azerbaijan still represents a major threat to international and regional peace and security. the conflict has resulted in the occupation of one fifth of the territory of azerbaijan and has made approximately one out of every nine persons in the country an internally displaced or refugee. since the very first day of the conflict, combat operations have been conducted exclusively inside the territory of azerbaijan, almost in the middle of the country, affecting its civilian population and infrastructure. in its resolutions of 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), the un security council acknowledged the fact that military force was used against azerbaijan; that such actions are unlawful and in contradiction with the purposes and principles of un charter; and that they constitute an obvious violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of azerbaijan. the numerous decisions and documents adopted by other authoritative international organizations have been framed along the same lines. however, the key security council demands, including in the first place the withdrawal ofthe armenian forces from the occupied territories of azerbaijan, have not been implemented yet. on the contrary, the policy and practice of armenia clearly testify to its intention to secure the annexation ofazerbaijani territories that it has captured through military force and in which it has carried out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale. initially, after changes in the government of armenia, there were some expectations that the new leadership will uphold democratic values and the norms and principles of international law, including the relevant resolutions and decisions of international organizations, particularly those adopted by the united nations security council. unfortunately, so far no progress has been observed in that regard. contrary to his earlier statements, the prime minister of armenia now does not shy away even from overtly attempting to regard the nagorno-karabakh region of azerbaijan as part of armenia. such an annexationist claim does not only constitute utter disrespect for the norms and principles of international law and the resolutions adopted by the security council, but even undermines the 4 peace process mediated by the osce minsk group and its co-chairs.thus, armenia at the highest political level demonstrates that its real intentions are not the settlement of the conflict through negotiations, but continuation of the illegal occupation of the azerbaijani territories. as there are consistent unstable internal political developments in armenia, with no external understanding on what is going on in this country, we cannot and will not exclude that the latest statements and actions of the armenian prime minister are aimed at escalating the situation on the ground even more and provoking armed hostilities along the line of contact and on the border between armenia and azerbaijan. but one thing is clear that full responsibility for the consequences of this negative scenario will lie entirely with the republic of armenia. we call upon the international community to send a strong message to and exert pressure on armenia to ensure its full compliance with international law and to immediately and unconditionally start implementation of the relevant un security council resolutions adopted with regard to the settlement of the armenia-azerbaijan conflict. armenia has consistently obstructed the conflict-settlement process and, in the meantime, refuses to conduct result-oriented negotiations, while it regularly resorts to various provocations to escalate the situation on the ground and tries to consolidate the occupation of the seized territories by changing their demographic, cultural and physical character and preventing the hundreds of thousands of forcibly displaced azerbaijanis from returning to their homes. in flagrant violation of the 1949 geneva conventions, armenia continues to exhibit its policy of illegal settlement of armenians, particularly those from syria, in the occupied territories of azerbaijan. armenia's new leadership should understand that their promises to the armenian people to make armenia economically developed and prosperous state can't be possible without peace, good neighborly relations and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors. the earlier armenia puts aside its territorial claims and withdraws troops from the territories of azerbaijan, the sooner peace can come to our region and prospects for armenia's development will be opened. they are now talking much about democracy and the armenians of the nagorno-karabakh region of azerbaijan. but what about the azerbaijani population of nagorno-karabakh and the azerbaijanis from the seven surrounding districts who were subjected to brutal ethnic cleansing and forced to leave their places of origin, homes and properties? if the new armenian leadership is calling itself democracy, then they have to act in accordance with the rule of law and democratic values and let those uprooted people return to their homes and withdraw its armed forces from the occupied territories of azerbaijan, as it is demanded by the relevant resolutions of the security council and other international organizations. azerbaijan sincerely believes that there is no alternative to peace, stability and mutually beneficial regional cooperation and is the most interested party in the earliest political settlement of the conflict. at the same time, no settlement of the conflict can be reached which violates the constitution of the republic of azerbaijan and is inconsistent with international law. the resolution ofthe conflict is possible only on the basis of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of azerbaijan within its internationally recognized borders. thank you.","elmar maharram oglu mammadyarov, minister for foreign affairs of azerbaijan, said coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities backed by adequate resources are essential to secure a sustainable and inclusive future for all. azerbaijan has adapted its national development strategy considering the sustainable development goals, and consistently aims to improve life for its citizens with a poverty level at 5.4 per cent and unemployment at 5 per cent. his country promotes regional development through connectivity, such as the establishment of an east-west transportation corridor, which saves time for moving goods between asia and europe. azerbaijan also initiated a transnational broadband project called the trans-eurasian information super highway that will lay a fiber optic line between hong kong and frankfurt and has nominated baku to host the world expo2025. beyond national development, his country is also committed to humanitarian assistance. education and health care are top domestic policy priorities for azerbaijan, he went on to say, also emphasizing the importance of fighting corruption and promoting human rights. azerbaijan is one of the world’s centers of peaceful multiculturalism and it seeks to promote those values globally through the hosting of international events. in that regard, he spoke of the baku process, launched in 2008, with the goal of strengthening partnership and cooperation between the muslim world and europe. he also announced that azerbaijan will take over chairmanship of the non-aligned movement in 2019. the ongoing armed conflict between armenia and azerbaijan still represents a major threat to international and regional peace, he said. citing the relevant security council resolutions, he said the 15-nation organ had acknowledged an obvious violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of azerbaijan yet no resolutions had been implemented. on the contrary, armenian policy and practices indicate its intention to secure the annexation of azerbaijani territories, he said. the prime minister of armenia regards the nagorno-karabakh region as part of armenia, contrary to international law and council resolutions, he said. he could not exclude that the latest statements and actions by the prime minister of armenia are aimed at escalating the situation, he said, calling on the international community to exert pressure on yerevan to comply with international law. armenia has consistently obstructed the conflict-settlement process and refuses to conduct result-oriented negotiations, he said. an economically developed and prosperous armenia is not possible without peace and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors, he remarked, imploring the that country’s new leadership to act in accordance with the rule of law and democratic values."
Bahamas,"national statement by dr. the hon. hubert a. minnis prime minister commonwealth of the bahamas 73rd united nations general assembly new york city, new york friday, 28 september 2018 madam president, excellencies, i congratulate you madam president on your election to the presidency of this 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. 1 wish to assure you and members of the bureau of the support of my delegation. i commend secretary general antonio guterres, who continues to guide the organization through a process of reform, which is vital for the continued relevance of our organization. i also pay tribute to the late kofi anan, for the immense contribution he made to the un and the global community. madam president, in this year, marking the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war, it is fitting that the theme for this 73rd session is: making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies . one of the painful lessons taught by the two world wars was the necessity of nations working together to minimize conflicts and to promote economic and social development. the relevance of the un to the global community is without question. this is not to say, madam president, that we ought not to strive to achieve more. this is an imperative. as nations, we must intensify our deliberations and commitments to addressing climate change. climate change is a clear and present danger to us all, but in particular to low-lying coastal nations like the bahamas. we see this in rising sea levels, the loss of coral reefs, the increased volume of acid in our oceans, and more severe and frequent hurricanes and typhoons. this time last year, the bahamas, many countries of the caribbean, and parts of the united states of america, faced the onslaught of category 4 or higher hurricanes. as 2 hurricane irma hurled towards the bahamas, my government took the difficult decision to evacuate residents from southern islands, to prevent the loss of lives and injury. gratefully, we escaped without loss of life, but our southern neighbors were not as fortunate. as such, i fully support secretary general guterres plan to call a climate summit next september to mobilize action and financial support. as part of such discussions, we must dedicate considerably more energy and resources in building the resilience and sustainability of our island and coastal nations. like our neighbors, the bahamas is trying to rebuild our islands. however, the consecutive damage of major hurricanes has made this very difficult. as an archipelago, with many islands stretching approximately 600 miles from north to south, we are required to replicate infrastructure many times over, with already limited resources. while the delivery of humanitarian aid is essential, it is equally important to focus on prevention, and the strengthening of capacity building. such an approach must be grounded in a comprehensive approach to sustainable development, that addresses, in an integrated manner, the range of issues that are critical to the bahamas, from disaster risk reduction to to the sustainable use of the world’s seas and oceans, to ensure their viability for generations to come. tourism is the world’s largest industry. it is also the lifeblood of the bahamian economy.millions of tourists travel to the bahamas annually because of our beautiful turquoise waters and biodiversity. in this context, the bahamas has committed to ban single-use plastics by 2020. the bahamas looks forward to the successful outcomes of the review of the samoa pathway, the international framework to advance these and other sustainable development priorities for small island developing states. the bahamas will also advocate for a strong outcome of the intergovernmental conference on an international, legally-binding instrument under the united nations convention on the law of the sea, on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. madam president, 3 earlier this week, i participated in the bloomberg roundtable on building resilient economies and preserving marine ecosystems in coastal commonwealth nations. i commend such dialog. however, 1 must stress that the bahamas and our neighbors are being beaten twice, for circumstances not of our own making. it is not our island nations that are primarily responsible for the climate change which results in the scourges of hurricanes and other natural disasters. however, when we respond to national need by borrowing internationally, to seek to restore basic human infrastructure, our debt to gdp ratio rises, risking the possibility of a rating downgrade. this limits our ability to provide for ourselves, except we are burdened with a price tag too heavy to be borne. madam president, a relevant un should urgently facilitate a meaningful dialog on the international stage to establish a workable solution. furthermore, the adverse impact of global financial inequity is seen in the use of the distorted matrix of gdp per capita as a measurement of national wealth and viability. this is done without due regard to a country s vulnerabilities and the weight that should be given to localized circumstances. we remain concerned and disappointed that the application of this matrix causes the bahamas to be assessed more favorably than it should be for contributions to international organizations, and for the receipt of grants, and international assistance when disaster strikes.the un must bring greater focus and action in response to this inequitable issue. we also reaffirm our support for cuba s ability to access resources for development to rebuild after disasters. similarly, notwithstanding the strong and unwavering commitment to the integrity of our financial services industry, the bahamas, like other jurisdictions, is in an uphill battle to avoid being blacklisted as a non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes. the goalposts for cooperation are constantly being moved. they are inequitably applied, with unfair advantages to some and disadvantages to others. the bahamas remains committed to international tax transparency and cooperation, exchange of information, and international regulatory standards, as well as to conduct business in a fair, transparent and competitive manner. 4 madam president, the bahamas is comprehensive y seeking to offer greater opportunities to our disadvantaged urban centers, through revitalisation, economically empowering and poverty alleviation initiatives. these initiatives have been designed to be consistent with the sustainable development goals. my government is committed to the sdgs, and will continue to work with the un and our other international partners and domestic stakeholders towards implementation. madam present, the bahamas is dedicated to serving as a productive presence and committed member of the council of the international maritime organization. we have presented our candidature for re-election to category c in the elections in 2019. the bahamas intends to continue its work to make positive and innovative contributions toward ensuring the safety and security of shipping, and the prevention of marine pollution by maritime vessels. the bahamas remains committed to the protection and promotion of human rights and to gender equality. the geographical location of the bahamas has made us particularly vulnerable to illegal migration. we have been embattled by this for decades. we are resolute, however, to fight illegal migration and to do so in a manner that prioritizes the safety and security of the bahamas, while adhering to human rights principles. the bahamas is committed to the use of information communication technology to support development. we have offered ourselves as the smart choice with our candidature for the council of the international telecommunication union. the bahamas has been endorsed by caricom. madam president, the world continues to make progress in myriad areas of economic, political and social development. 5 but progress requires the eternal vigilance of every generation and a recommitment to upholding the dignity and equality of all people, and unrelenting international cooperation. i wish to reaffirm the commitment of the bahamas to the principles enshrined in the charter of this great organization. i thank you madam president on behalf of the people of the commonwealth of the bahamas. 6","hubert alexander minnis, prime minister of the bahamas, said that although the united nations is unquestionably relevant to the global community, it is imperative to strive to achieve more. climate change is a clear and present danger to all, but especially low‑lying coastal nations like the bahamas, as witnessed in rising sea levels, loss of coral reefs, increased ocean acid volume and more severe, frequent hurricanes and typhoons. he recalled that his government evacuated residents from southern islands to prevent loss of lives as hurricane irma approached. while there were no fatalities in the bahamas, “our southern neighbors were not as fortunate”, and he therefore fully supports the secretary‑general’s plan for a climate summit next year. such discussions must generate more energy and resources to build the resilience and sustainability of island and coastal nations. he said the consecutive damage of major hurricanes has made it difficult to rebuild the bahamas, an archipelago stretching some 600 miles from north to south, requiring them to replicate infrastructure many times with limited resources. while delivering humanitarian aid is essential, so is a comprehensive approach to sustainable development to address disaster risk reduction and the viability of seas and oceans for posterity. tourism is the world’s largest industry and the lifeblood of the bahamian economy, he said, with millions of annual visitors. to protect its waters and biodiversity, the bahamas will ban single‑use plastics by 2020. looking forward to the successful review of the samoa pathway, he will also advocate an international legally binding instrument under the united nations convention on the law of the sea, on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. he noted that the bahamas and its neighbors are “being beaten twice”: while island nations are not primarily responsible for the climate change which results in hurricanes, when they borrow internationally to restore basic human infrastructure, their debt‑to‑gross domestic product (gdp) ratio rises. calling for the united nations to facilitate international dialog for a workable solution, he also pointed to “the distorted matrix of gdp per capita as a measurement of national wealth and viability” that causes the bahamas to be assessed more favorably than it should for contributions to international organizations, and when international aid is needed when disaster strikes. further afield, he reaffirmed support for cuba to access resources to rebuild after disasters. highlighting an uphill battle to avoid blacklisting as a non‑cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes, he stated the country remains committed to international tax transparency and cooperation, regulatory standards and doing business in a fair, competitive manner. in keeping with the sustainable development goals, his government seeks to revitalize urban centers with economic and poverty alleviation initiatives. as a member of the council of the international maritime organization (imo), the bahamas has presented candidature for re‑election to category “c” and intends to continue working for safe and secure shipping and preventing marine pollution by maritime vessels. although the bahamas’ geographical location has made it particularly vulnerable to illegal migration, he stated the country will continue to fight it while adhering to human rights principles."
Bahrain,,"shaikh khalid bin ahmed al-khalifa, minister for foreign affairs of bahrain, said his country, keen to implement programs, plans to keep up with international efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals and raise the standards of living for its citizens. his country has succeeded in mitigating the impact of economic challenges, allowing it to become one of the fastest‑growing economies in the region. further, bahrain’s election to the committee on non‑governmental organizations for 2019‑2022 reflects international appreciation for its policies that consolidate rights and liberties and contribute to the advancement of the objectives and purposes of the united nations. in addition, his country has put forward its candidacy to become a member of the human rights council for 2019‑2021. achieving lasting peace, security and sustainable development in the countries of his region is a collective responsibility, he stressed. however, the iranian regime aspires to impose its hegemony on the region by “packaging and exporting its miserable revolution under which the iranian people suffer from tyranny, oppression and injustice”, he stated. the extremist ideology it disseminates is threatening the ambitions and aspirations of people who have coexisted for many centuries. in addition, at a time where it is imperative to establish common mechanisms for collective security, qatar is another impediment threatening security and stability in the region through its dangerous tendency to spread and feed terrorism. he expressed hope that it will respond to the conditions put forth by bahrain, saudi arabia, united arab emirates and egypt — conditions consistent with international law, and the principles of good neighborliness, mutual respect, and respect for the sovereignty and independence of states. he welcomed the united states’ efforts in that regard, notably their cooperation to create the middle east strategic alliance and their strategy vis‑à‑vis the iranian regime. iran must end its occupation of the united arab emirates islands of greater tunb, lesser tunb and abu musa and must seriously respond to the emiratis’ efforts to restore their sovereignty on their territory. iran should also seek resolution of this issue through the international court of justice. regarding the situation in palestine, he said “jerusalem must remain, as it has always been, the historic symbol of coexistence and harmony among religions”, emphasizing the importance of the commitment not to alter the legal status of east jerusalem. the international community must act to put an end to all israeli measures concerning the inhabitants of jerusalem, sacred sites, and places of worship. he expressed hope that iraq will resume its leading role in its arab, regional and international environment. it is necessary that regional interference in iraqi internal affairs, particularly that of iran, come to an end. he reiterated support for all efforts towards the reconstruction of the state and the unification of the military in libya. this would enable the army to protect the country and confront terrorism while preserving its unity and territorial integrity. in addition, he stressed that his country stands by morocco against the flagrant iranian plotting and interference in its internal affairs. it also supports morocco’s serious and credible efforts to reach a solution regarding the moroccan sahara, based on the moroccan initiative of autonomy and relevant security council resolutions, he added."
Bangladesh,"73rd session of the united nations general assembly address by sheik hasina hon ble prime minister government of the people s republic of bangladesh the united nations new york 27 september 2018 bismillahir rahmanir rahim madam president, as-salamu alaikum and good evening. let me congratulate you on your election as the fourth female president of the un general assembly during its 73 years history. i assure you of my delegation’s full support in upholding your commitment to the un. i also felicitate mr. antonio guterres, un secretary general for his firm and courageous leadership in promoting global peace, security and sustainable development. madam president, the theme you have chosen for this year’s session brings back some personal memories for me. forty-four years ago, my father, the father of the nation bangabandhu sheik mujibur rahman stood on this podium and said, / quote, peace is an imperative for the survival of humanity. it represents the deepest aspirations of men and women throughout the world... the united nations remains as the center of hope for the future of the people in this world of sadness, misery and conflict. unquote madam president, my father bangab ndhu sheik mujibur rahman devoted his life for the socio¬ economic development of the people of bangladesh. he had done so at a time when 90% of the population lived below the poverty line. following 24 years of stmggle culminating in the victory of our liberation war, bangladesh gained independence under his leadership in 1971. during this long period of struggle, he spent his time in the prison for almost 14 years. there were plots to assassinate him again and again. 2 following the independence, bangabandhu directed his strength to rebuild a warravaged country with a ruined economy. the people got back a sense of relief. bangladesh set on its journey ahead as an ldc. yet, what a misfortune for our people! bangabandhu could lead the country only for three years and a half. he was brutally gunned down by assassins on 15 august 1975. along with him, 18 members of my family - among them my mother begum fazilatunnesa, three brothers, the youngest only ten years of age, and two newly-wed sisters-in-law were also killed. my sister sheik rehana and i happened to be abroad at the time and survived the mayhem. but, we were barred from getting back to the country. the military dictator who grabbed power at the time promulgated an indemnity ordinance and blocked the possibility for bringing the killers to justice. we were denied the right to seek justice for the gruesome murders. madam president, i can feel the pain and suffering of countless people around the world, persecuted and expelled from their homes like the rohingya. it is impossible to build peaceful, just and sustainable societies by ignoring such situations. the myanmar situation repeatedly reminds us of the genocide committed by the pakistan occupation forces against our people in 1971. during the nine months of our liberation war, the pakistanis had killed three million innocent bengalis. two hundred thousand women had to suffer heinous torture and abuse. ten million people had to flee their homes and take refuge in india. my father was arrested and taken to pakistan. i was also taken prisoner along with my mother, two younger brothers and a sister. i was expecting my first child at the time. he was bom in captivity. we had to spend our days in a damp unhealthy environment. we are appalled by what we have seen in un reports about atrocities against the rohingya who have now taken shelter in bangladesh, which are tantamount to genocide and crimes against humanity. we expect the inte ational community, particularly the un, to give due importance to the atrocities and injustice suffered by the rohingya population in myanmar. 3 madam president, as a fellow human, we can neither ignore nor remain silent about the plight of the rohingya. when my father and family members had been killed, i was not allowed to return home for six years. my sister and i were compelled to live abroad as refugees. i can feel the misery of losing one s loved ones and of living in a different land as a refugee. i, therefore, presented a five-point proposal at the un general assembly last year with a view to finding a durable and peaceful solution to the sufferings of the forcibly displaced and hapless rohingya. we are disappointed that despite our earnest efforts we have not been able to begin rohingya repatriation in a permanent and sustainable manner. myanmar is one of our neighbors. from the outset, we have been trying to find a peaceful solution to the rohingya crisis through bilateral consultations. so far, three bilateral arrangements have been concluded between bangladesh and myanmar for rohingya repatriation. despite their verbal commitment to take back the rohingya, in reality the myanmar authorities are yet to accept them back. the 1.1 million rohingya hosted in bangladesh are living in an uncertain situation. to the best of our ability, we have made arrangements for their food, clothing, healthcare, child-care and security. many countries and organizations including the un, the commonwealth, and the qic have shown solidarity with the rohingya and extended support and assistance for them. i extend my appreciation and thanks to the international community. so long the rohingya are not able to return home, they should, as a temporary arrangement, be able to live in a good and healthy condition. with this in mind, we have started working on a new housing facility for them with all arrangements for their education, health care and other needs. i call upon international organizations to join hands with us in this initiative. i also seek their assistance to help relocate the rohingya to the facility. 4 the rohingya crisis has had its origin in myanmar. as such, its solution has to be found in myanmar. we also wish to see immediate and effective implementation of the agreement concluded between myanmar and the un. we want an early, peaceful solution to the rohingya crisis. madam president, in last 30 years, bangladesh has made its contribution to international peace by deploying over 158,000 peacekeepers in 54 missions. 145 peacekeepers from bangladesh have made their supreme sacrifice in the line of duty. currently, more than 7,000 peacekeepers including 144 women are deployed in ten different missions. our peacekeepers have been acclaimed for their professionalism, courage and success. we pledged 23 contingents under the peacekeeping capability readiness system . as the original proponent, bangladesh expected to see a more robust and human rights centric global compact on safe, regular and orderly migration. in the contemporary global context, the migration compact should be considered a positive step and should serve as a living document for protecting the rights of migrants. bangladesh stands firm against terrorism and all organized crimes. we shall not allow our territory to be used for any terrorist acts against or any activity detrimental to the interest of our neighbors. our zero tolerance policy in countering terrorism will continue undiminished. our ‘whole of society’ approach has served us well in preventing violent extremism, human trafficking and flow of illicit drugs. bangladesh has aligned itself with the global call to action on the world drug problem mooted by the united states. madam president, since 2009, we have been implementing inclusive and people-centric development policies. on our way to realizing shonar bangla as envisioned by our father of the nation bangabandhu sheik mujibur rahman, we remain committed to fulfilling our people’s aspirations. 5 the world bank recognized bangladesh as a middle-income country in 2015. bangladesh is the 43rd largest economy in the world in terms of nominal gdp. our per capita income has increased from us$ 543 in 2006 to us$ 1,752 in 2018. we have achieved the average gdp growth rate of 7.86%. inflation has decreased by 5.4%. poverty rate has dropped from 41.5% in 2006 to 21.4% in 2018. during the same period, extreme poverty has decreased from 24% to 11.3%. our forex reserve was usd 7.5 billion in 2008-09 fiscal year. in 2018, it grew up to usd 32.2 billion. public investment was at 4.3% of gdp in 2009. it rose to 8.2% in 2018. power generation capacity has gone up to 20,000 megawatts from 3000 megawatts in 2009. we are building coal-based super-critical power generation plants to ensure sustainable power supply. in remote areas without transmission lines, power supply is being ensured with the help of 5.5 million solar panels. 90% of our population has come under electricity coverage. with the launch of the work on the rooppur nuclear power plant, we have moved a step ahead in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. bangladesh is now recognized as a global development model. we have commenced our journey from being an ldc to the status of a developing country. the pathway for graduation is inextricably linked with our sdg implementation strategy, which is integrated in our seventh five year plan. we remain fully committed to implementing the sdgs. in the backdrop of our current economic growth, there are now immense and large- scale business opportunities in bangladesh. foreign investors are being offered various financial incentives like tax holiday, avoidance of double taxation and exemption of duties. we are setting up 100 special economic zones that would help create 10 million job opportunities in bangladesh. 6 madam president, to follow up on my role as a member, we remain co mitted to implement the outcome of the high-level panel on water, formed under the joint initiative of the un secretary general and the world bank president. i urge world leaders to take urgent actions on proper appraisal, management and investment in water. we shall be held responsible to our future generations if we fail to do so. my government remains committed to ensuring safe drinking water and sanitation for all through achieving sdg 6. as of now, 99% of our people have access to sanitation and 88% to safe drinking water. madam president, under our social safety-net programs, 6.5 million elderly men and women, widows, destitute women and persons with disabilities are getting regular allowances. since 2010, students are receiving free textbooks from pre-primary to secondary levels in school. 354.92 million books have been distributed among 43.76 million students this year. vision impaired students are receiving braile books. children from ethnic minorities are being given books in their mother languages. around 20.03 million students from primary to graduate level are getting stipends. stipend money for 14 million students is sent directly to their mothers through mobile phones. we have ensured 100% enrollment at the primary level. literacy rate has increased from 45% to 72.9% in the last nine and half years. our home-grown, innovative socio-economic development models have gained widely popular acceptance. micro-savings have been introduced for rural, marginalized communities through the one house, one farm (ekti bari, ekti khamar) project. the amount saved by beneficiaries on their individual accounts is equaled in deposit by the government. the ‘shelter project (ashrayon) is being implemented wi h the aim of having no homeless person in bangladesh. we are working towards reaching urban facilities to every one of our villages. 7 madam president, women s empowerment and participation ave been a major factor in bangladesh’s outstanding development. we have promoted women’s empowerment through enhancing their education opportunities and facilitating their political and economic emancipation. we have created opportunities for girls to pursue their education free of cost till twelfth grade in public educational institutions. at secondary level, the ratio of girls and boys is 53:47. in early 2009, it was 35:65. bangladesh is perhaps the world’s only country, where in its national parliament, the speaker, the leader of the house, the deputy leader of the house, and the leader of the opposition are all women. in the present parliament, there are 72 elected female members. 33% seats are earmarked for women in local government bodies in order to promote women’s political empowerment at the grassroots. around 20 million women are employed in agriculture, service and industrial sectors. women constitute 80% of 4.5 million workers engaged in the largest export ea ing garments sector. women entrepreneurs are offered collateral free bank loans with 5% service charge. 10% of small entrepreneurs’ fund and 10% of industrial plots are earmarked for women entrepreneurs. madam president, bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. more than 160 million people now live in a land area of only 147,570 square km. despite our resource constraints, we have made significant strides across a range of social indices. the maternal mortality rate has decreased to 170 per 1000 and child mortality rate under the age of five has gone down to 28 per thousand. life expectancy has increased to 72 years from 64 in 2009. in the last fiscal year, we spent 5.9% of our national budget in the public health sector. this year, investment in health has been increased by 17%. with around 18,000 community health clinics and union health centers operating, health care 8 been reached to our people s doorsteps. 30 different types of medicines are being distributed free of cost. tuberculosis prevention and control efforts have been intensified to reach the 2030 sdg target. as a result, tb related deaths have reduced by 19% in the last two years. madam president, bangladesh has been playing a pioneering role in raising awareness about the needs of children affected by autism and other neuro-developmental disorders. in order to further consolidate our efforts in this regard, a specialized cell is being created in the ministry of health and family welfare. a national steering committee and a national advisory committee have already been set up. saima hossain wazed, chairperson of the advisory committee and a member of the world health organization’s (who) expert advisory panel on mental health, has been named a goodwill ambassador on this issue for south asia. madam president, we welcome the formation of the secretary general’s high-level panel on digital cooperation. the underlying premise of our vision for a ""digital bangladesh"" is to promote people’s well-being. widespread introduction of inte et-based public service delivery has led to growth in job creation at the grass root level. the idea of a digital bangladesh has become real. we have made our foray into the world of space technology by launching our own satellite, bangabandhu i, being the 57th country in the world to have done so. it was in fact a dream of our father of the nation that we would one day reach the outer space. the launching of this satellite helped us realize the aspiration he had instilled in us by setting up the first satellite ground-station of the country on 14 june 1975. madam president, bangladesh is among the 10 most climate vulnerable countries in the world. its topography coupled with high density of population has made the country particularly exposed to climate change risks. 9 bangladesh remains com itted to implement the paris agreement. we are spendi g over 1% of our gdp in addressing climate change impacts; we are also promoting climate-resilient agriculture. initiatives have been taken to increase tree coverage from 22% to 24% in the next five years. a project worth 50 million us dollar is being implemented for the conservation of the sundarbans, the world s largest mangrove forest and a unesco world heritage site. we have integrated our development programs and our efforts to build capacity for combating climate change into a mega project titled delta plan 2100. it is a water-centric, multi-sectoral, techno-economic plan with a long-term time frame. it has been developed in consideration of the local geo-morphology and of global climate change impact. bangladesh is the only country in the world that has adopted such a long-term development plan spanning 82 years. madam president, we are shocked by the continued violation of the rights of the brotherly people of palestine. this must come to an end. as the chair of the qic council of foreign ministers, we shall continue to work with the international community for resolution of the palestine question. madam president, there are three elements that play the most critical part in advancing human civilization: peace, humanity and development. for the well-being of human societies, we must continue to strive for humanity. our main objective must be to serve the people nd ensure their well-being. it is humanity and goodwill that would take us forward on the pathway to sustainable development. in a world faced with myriad of challenges, our common interest, shared responsibility and sustainable partnership would be our best bet for preserving the human civilization. 10 madam president, all my life, i have been working selflessly to make a dif erence in the lives of my people. in the last nine years and a half, bangladesh has achieved remarkable success in different socio-economic sectors. that bangladesh the world knew as the land plagued by disasters, floods, droughts and hunger has done wonders in maintaining inte ational peace, managing disasters, empowering women and consolidating development gains. bangladesh has now surpassed its neighbors in south asia on a number of indicators. but, our journey has not reached its end. our journey will continue till the day we can build a bangladesh free of hunger, poverty, illiteracy and exploitation - the shonar bangladesh of our father of the nation bangabandhu sheik mujibur rahman. i thank you. khoda hafez joy bangla, joy bangabandhu may bangladesh live-forever","sheik hasina, prime minister of bangladesh, recalled her father’s work to improve his country’s socioeconomic development at a time when 90 per cent of its population lived below the poverty line. in 1975, he was assassinated along with 18 other members of her family, and she — who was abroad at the time — was barred from re‑entering bangladesh. a military dictator took power and her family was denied the right to seek justice for the gruesome murders. “i can feel the pain and suffering of countless people around the world, persecuted and expelled from their homes like the rohingya,” she said. indeed, the situation in neighboring myanmar is a reminder of the genocide committed by pakistani occupying forces against the people of bangladesh in 1971. emphasizing that her government is appalled by recent united nations reports about the atrocities committed against the rohingya population – which are also tantamount to genocide and crimes against humanity – she voiced the expectation that the international community, and particularly the united nations, give due importance to that population. having lived abroad as a refugee herself, she expressed the pain and misery of losing one’s loved ones and of living in a different land. for those reasons, she presented to the assembly in 2017 a five‑point proposal aimed at finding a durable, peaceful solution to the suffering of the forcibly displaced rohingya. “we are disappointed that despite our earnest efforts, we have not been able to begin a rohingya repatriation in a permanent and sustainable manner.” outlining bangladesh’s attempts to reach a peaceful solution to the crisis as well as its support for the 1.1 million refugees that fled into the country, she said the government is building a new housing facility including arrangements for education, health care and other needs. calling on international organizations to join in those initiatives - as well as to help relocate the rohingya to the facility – she went on describe bangladesh’s deployment of over 158,000 peacekeepers in 54 united nations missions. in addition, as its original proponent, bangladesh supports a more robust and human rights–centric global compact on safe, regular and orderly migration. reiterating bangladesh’s firm commitment to stand against terrorism and all organized crime, she said it will not allow its territory to be used for any such acts. indeed, the country maintains a zero‑tolerance policy in countering terrorism and a “whole of society” approach to preventing violent extremism, human trafficking and the flow of illicit drugs. aligning herself with the global call to action on the world drug problem led by the united states, she went on to describe bangladesh’s overall inclusive, people‑centric development policies. she also outlined its rising gdp, its increasing use of renewable energy and its peaceful use of nuclear energy. “bangladesh is now recognized as a global development model,” she said, noting that it has begun its journey from a least developed country to a developing country. that path will be inextricably linked with its implementation of the sustainable development goals, which is integrated in its seventh five year plan. she also spotlighted “immense and large‑scale” business opportunities — noting that foreign investors are being offered various financial incentives to do business in bangladesh — and its success in boosting school enrolment rates, improving women’s participation in government, reducing child and maternal mortality, bringing sanitation to 99 per cent of its people and delivering safe drinking water to 88 per cent."
Barbados,"permanent mission of barbados to the united nations statement by hon. mia amor mottley, q.c. m.p. prime minister of barbados to the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly 28 september, 2018 united nations general assembly new york please check against deliv ry madam president, let me begin by congratulating you on your election and in particular, for being only the fourth woman in the 73 year history of this organization, to hold the high honor of being elevated to the position of president of the united nations general assembly, ! lso take this opportunity to express my delega ion s thanks to your redeces or, his excellency, wir, miroslav lajcak for the way in which he conducted the work of tire genera! assembly during the 72n session and to wish him well. permit me, adam president to observe that this united nations must show leadership in recognizing the talents and contributions of women to human civilization and progress. women have value and give much, whether they labor over smoking wood fires; whether generations of women are tra ped in poverty because of a lack of opportunity, equality and respect; whether they lead countries; whether they stay at home to care for families; or whether they come to the un, as you have, to preside over outcome documents, robust negotiations, bracketed paragraphs, reform processes and global policy platforms, in the name of creating for all people everywhere, a life of dignity. madam president, as a female leader, i cannot help but observe that the face of poverty all over the world, is predominantly fe ale and i commend you on your seven priority areas one of which is i proving the quality of life of women and girls. madam president, when barbados first prime minister, the right excellent, errol walton barrow, addressed this august assembly for the first time i after independence, just over 50 years ago, he made the pronouncement that in its international relationships barbados would be friends of all and satellites of none. that assertion became the underpinning philosophy that has guided how barbados conducted itself on the world stage. the challenge now, however, is that our country s core principles and values have remained constant, but the world in which we live has changed. it has become increasingly hostile. transactions have become more important than relationships. indeed, the mighty maneuver to make minions of the majority. i entered public life almost three decades ago. at that time, i never believed that as barbados entered the second fifty years of our independence we would again be forced to fight battles that predated independence. the universal declaration of human rights was forged out of the rejection of the dominance of commercialism over the citizen; out of social and economic alienation; out of two world wars and an atomic bomb and the world’s recognition that the human family must unite to ensure that we never again stand on the precipice of annihilation. madam chairman, the government which i have the honor to lead, was voted into office just over three months ago, in the midst of the most dire economic crisis barbados has ever faced. the tremendous challenge and responsibility now is to define a new trajectory for my country. we must reinforce our core values as a people while remaining relevant and responsive in a rapidly evolving and often hostile world, which threatens the viability of small vulnerable states such as my own. peace and social stability can only exist when all 2 the world s citizens are given the opportunity and space to thrive. trade and business flourish when societies develop and are able to buy each other s goods and services. this yields more beneficial results than the building of walls, the tightening of borders and the closing of ports to refugees and migrants. as in the past, a fair opportunity is all my country and citizens seek. the multilateral system acknowledges and fosters mutual respect and dignity for all members of the human family, whether they are mighty or meek. it accords to all the right to li e in societies that are stable, peaceful, equitable and sustainable. the conditions for such societies are created not by fine words, but by fair actions, not by flowery rhetoric, but by resolute determination to work for the good of all the peoples of the world. hence adam president, it is in this forum that sids and other vulnerable countries must know that their sovereignty is to be respected and advanced and that the meek have no less a right to exist in dignity, than do the mighty. platforms such rio and rio+20, the barbados plan of action, the mauritius strategy of implementation, the samoa pathway, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development as founded on the sdgs, the paris agreement and the addis ababa action agenda on financing for development, the reform of the security council and of the un itself, must provide the architecture for transformation for the people who most need to be lifted out of overty and moved out of the way of serious threats to their survival and sustainability. 3 today s leaders are again fighting battles for non-interference, respect, recognition and rights that many of us thought had long been won by a previous generation. economic colonization is replacing physical colonization. a creeping trend against multilateralism threatens to undermine, and perhaps even reverse, the effort and achievement of more than 70 years of collectivism. this should concern us all. evidence and history clearly show that this organization is at its strongest when it unites in pursuit of great causes and the wellbeing of the entire human family; when it has worked for peace, to ensure that bombs and bullets do not cut down our boys before they become men; that our girls have access to education; our wo en do not die in childbirth; that all people have the opportunity for decent work and that irrespective of the country in which they are born, our children can have a reasonable life expectancy. people take the work and achievements of the united nations for granted because they are rarely reminded that the peace, prosperity, security and stability enjoyed by the majority of the world’s citizens come through the collectivism of the un’s 193 member-states. the hard lessons of history demonstrate that we can only survive in a world based on a transparent rules-based system; that respects the dignity of citizens; that protects the sovereignty of states to chart their own destiny; that engenders inclusion over alienation; and fairness over favoritism. these are the very essence of multilateralism. the tensions of a world torn by isms and schisms , by religious intolerance, by xenophobia and fear, by bullying and greed, cannot lead to prosperity and stability, neither for the mighty 4 nor for the meek. when this united nations was founded, our leaders passed to us a baton. it was a vision of hope for humanity. let us ask ourselves, can we truly afford to drop the baton in the race of development? or in the pursuit of the sdgs? or because of a failure to stand in unison and speak truth to power , in order to defend the gains made by generations now gone? madam president, i speak in this assembly at a time when the confluence of circumstances on our social, economic and environmental landscapes are so severely threatened that caribbean civilization, as we know it, is at risk. let me share with you the reality and challenges confronting the leaders of small, vulnerable island states. ¦ countries of our region, such as guyana and belize, face border disputes and in the case of cuba, a decades-long embargo keeps their people disadvantaged and national progress constrained. these are matters of serious concern for barbados. should we take it as a given that some countries can always determine the stability of others? why do you think that the figures of history who garner the most respect are the humanitarians - ghandi, martin luther king, andela, kofi annan? ¦ less than 48 hours ago, at the one planet summit i saw a map which has since haunted me. the map showed a number of dangerous tipping points that if reached, will result in devastation to the peoples of the arctic, antarctic and coral 5 reef regions of our world. an increase in mean temperatures of two degrees, will wipe out the islands of the coral reefs and their peoples who are already contending with the increased frequency and ferocity of hurricane systems. just like our ancestors, we are being shown that we are marginal at best and irrelevant at worst. if our coral reefs are estroyed and islands are inundated by sea level rise, where are we to go? ¦ in my region and my country, our path to economic growth is being choked off unilaterally by institutions in which we are not allowed to advocate for ourselves and from which others dictate our fate. barbados, the caribbean and other sids have had to confront the reality that our percentage in trade of goods and services is miniscule, but we are bound by the same rules that apply to those who dominate and can distort global trade. small states like mine were shepherded out of agriculture and told that services were the route we should use for development. my country, for example, tried financial services pursuant to double taxation treaties, utilizing due diligence, operating a clean jurisdiction that is not a tax haven and complying with oecd requirements. now we are being told our tax practices are harmful and unfair competition to those who still enjoy the bulk of the revenues in global trade and services. where are we to turn? ¦ these twin threats to which i just referred are conjoined with our high debt to gdp ratios, now likely to increase because of derisking. the unilateral cessation of correspondent banking relationships reduces access to capital and our capacity to 6 engage in trade and conduct business in the international market place, derisking jeopardizes our capacity to remain properly integrated into the global financial, trade and economic systems. is there no door to development that our people can legitimately enter? ¦ bad though all of this is, there is still more, madam president. our classification as middle income countries denies us the concessionary financing which we so desperately need to help to build capacity and resilience. moreover madam president, the designation of middle income status of the islands of the caribbean, based solely on gdp per capita inco e, yet ignoring vulnerabilities and the absence of resilience, really only serves to misconstrue wellbeing as entrenched and irreversible. that is a false perception when set against our experience, which demonstrates that the veneer of wellbeing is easily stripped away by sea swells, strong winds or rising rivers across the island chain. this has been repeatedly proven in every decade by hurricanes such as gilbert, katrina, and more recently ivan, irma and maria, which robbed several islands of years of work and effort, over 200% of gdp and set back, by decades, their dreams of develop ent. even as i speak, madam chairman, tropical storm kirk is churning past my country and heading across the islands of the eastern caribbean. even though the eye passed north of barbados, and even though its wind speeds have, technically, not merited the categorization of hurricane, it has rained for 12 hours straight over the island and caused severe flooding and property and infrastructural damage across large sections of the country. i 7 am therefore cutting short my official duties abroad and returning home this evening. but i ask - would vulnerability not be a better measure of status and sustainability than gdp? ¦ our shrinking economic and development space have contracted even further as result of a reduction in official development assistance and foreign direct investment. yet, we remain highly vulnerable with limited size, capacity. in these circumstances, are we not deserving of the policy space and opportunity to build social, economic and environmental resilience? ¦ the new language of the development system encourages us to pursue innovative financing. this connotes the tightening of tax loopholes, strengthening collection, the elimination of corruption and the widening of the net in order to ensure the taxes that are owed actually reach government s coffers. the truth is, that the national tax bases of sids are low yield because of the small size of our populations and the microbusinesses which comprise our indigenous business sectors. hence, the utilization of private-public partnerships or ppps which are also being advocated, have low returns on investment and are therefore unattractive for the international private sector. the financing for develo ment agenda does not include any specific provision for sids that is predicated on our realities and vulnerabilities. where then is the revenue to finance development to come from? 8 madam president, having voiced my concerns, let me now share my commitments. barbados is committed to multilateralism. in the absence of a rules based system, the law of the jungle dominates. it becomes the meek versus the mighty. for us the commitment to multilateralism is not an academic exercise. it is critical to our existence and our being and that, fundamentally, is the only way in which we are not unequally yoked. it is the only way in which we have choice and by extension, freedom to exist. we are committed to the establishment within the multilateral system of a mechanism for development financing which recognizes the vulnerabilities of sids and uses their maritime space, which is an effective carbon sink and is significantly larger than their terrestrial space, as the basis for funding. in the case of barbados, our maritime space is 400 times larger than our terrestrial space. we are committed to pursuing a green economy and blue economy. to this end, my government has established a single ministry with responsibility for maritime affairs and the blue economy. in 2007, barbados was the first government in the americas to establish a national green economy policy which we will fully operationalise and transition barbados to a climate resilient society and economy powered by renewable energy. we are committed to finding and maximizing legitimate policy space to pay our way in the world and to ensure our citizens dignity and a better quality of life. 9 we are committed to creating a prosperous, entrepreneurial society with fair opportunity for our citizens in which they can live free from the scourge of the ncds, drugs and gun violence. we are committed to building a strong, exceptional barbados brand within the global family of nations. i speak for humanity and in defense of caribbean civilization. i cannot accept that we are dispensable. so who among you is listening? which of you is really hearing? who is prepared to stand in the breech, in defense of one world? who are prepared to raise their voices in support of those of us who have been asked to remain mute and invisible, while the rest of the world gets on with the business of development? as all previous generations have been, our generation will be judged, not on nice words or appropriate incantations, but on the effectiveness of our actions. will we carry and hand over to future generations, the baton left us by those who dreamed of a world of united nations or will we drop it? i urge you today, to hold that baton tight as we run the development course and until it is time to hand over. we cannot and must not fail. madam president, i am much obliged to you. 10","mia amor mottley, prime minister of barbados, began by talking about the string of cataclysmic weather events of the last 24 hours: tropical storm kirk that hit barbados and saint lucia, the earthquake that impacted martinique, dominica and guadalupe; the earthquake and tsunami in indonesia; and an impending typhoon in japan. “in good conscience, i cannot give the speech that i prepared,” she said, noting that she was cutting her trip short to fly home tonight to deal with the floods at home. “some wish that i would speak on denuclearization or non‑communicable diseases, or other [issues],” she said, but added that now the world is beginning to understand the impacts of climate change. “i ask this global community to pause. time is running out,” she said, referring to taking concrete action on climate change. she added that yes, we have banned single‑use plastic and other items that pollute, but these are decisions on a national level. we can try to ensure fossil fuels are phased out by 2030, but this is against a background that is not putting mechanisms in place. “what does this mean to those who are relying on a green climate fund, but the capacity is simply not there?” she said, calling on all people of the world to look after one another. “we, as a small state, are used to being treated as if we didn’t exist,” she said, adding that it is as if you can just cut off a region. she urged sovereign countries to ask themselves if this is still the world that is promised in the universal declaration of human rights. underscoring the need for small states to have a corridor of stability to withstand the shocks of climate change, she noted the importance of the united nations as a multilateral body. “it matters. it protects the small and constrains the large. when you take away multilateralism, who will hear us?” but what is clearly required is behavioral change, she said, adding that we ask ourselves why we must come here year after year and speak about the embargo of cuba again and again, as if it is pro forma. we speak about territorial disputes but see no gain. “it cannot be alright with the issue of climate change, because this is a matter of life or death,” she said. she called for a reconsideration of the commitment of keeping global temperature rise to below 1.5°c, because 2°c is calamitous, she said, adding that the world needed financing that speaks to the needs of small island developing states. our principles must remain constant, she said, adding that: “what happened in the last 24 hours is not a science fiction movie. we must have caring and empathy,” she urged, asking for the world to pause and get this one right. “it is not about governments anymore, it is about people,” she said."
Belarus,"statement by his excellency vladimir makei minister of foreign affairs of belarus 73''<' session of the un general assembly general debate new york, october 1®*, 2018 mr. president, ladies and gentlemen, we live in paradoxical times, when optimism and pessimism equally characterize our life. indeed, we have recently endorsed such momentous documents as the united nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the paris climate agreement. later this year, the international community is bound to give the ""green light"" to two more instruments that inspire particular hopes for changing the situation in the world for the better. these are the global compacts on refugees and on migrants. the implementation of these singular initiatives is intended to transform human life on the globe in a most drastic way, to make globalization both fair and a ""win-win"" phenomenon, as well as to eradicate poverty and preserve the planet for future generations. the search for answers to global challenges, the quest for ways to address common objectives clearly points out the following - no country can solve them alone. individual headway is impossible without collective progress. that is why no matter how justified the criticism voiced against the united nations is, we still need the organization as a unique platform for cooperation, as an efficient multilateral mechanism based on the principles that guarantee equal and respectful attitude towards each and every country, its priorities and needs. what is above all required to assist states in implementing the ambitious goals stemming from the 2030 agenda are effective ""un country teams"", which can furnish governments on their path to sustainable development with result-oriented and rational support. that is exactly where we see the gist of the un development reform. ladies and gentlemen, expanding the reach of globalization and streamlining its management in ways that meet both everyone's interest and common good remain a fundamental contemporary task. yet, certain difficulties can be seen there. globalization is accompanied by emerging geo-political and geo-econcmic fault-lines not just in the regional context, but also on the global scale. a kind of a civiiizational trap is taking shape, in which the demands for integration go hand in glove with the manifestations of fragmentation, protectionism and even confrontation. located in the center of europe, belarus, on the one hand, is a member of the eurasian economic union, while on the other, it has an interest in pursuing intensive economic cooperation with the european union. ""squeezed"" by the two geopolitical power centers, we fully feel the interplay between geo-politics and geo-economics. the conflict in ukraine, the rising tension in the region, sanctions and counter-sanctions weigh heavily on our country, if not often directly, then indirectly, in the form of substantial economic loses. belarus, as a middle-sized country with one of the most open economies in the world - because we export up to 60-70 percent of our gdp - is heavily dependent on external markets and international trade. that is one of the reasons we consistently stand for building a fair, predictable and non- discriminatory trade and economic architecture both in europe and elsewhere, which would be aligned with the interests of all countries. we believe that it should be underpinned by multi-tier integration projects. owing to its geographical location, belarus is particularly interested in closer cooperation between the eurasian economic union and the european union. after all, our western border remains essentially the only economic borderline on the huge space stretching from lisbon to vladivostok, and, in a longerterm perspective, reaching perhaps as far southward as shanghai. that is why belarus has been very consistent in advocating the idea of ""integration of integrations"" as the principle of cooperation oriented around a common search for optimal ways towards unifying economic growth and sustainable development. attaining the goals of the sustainable development agenda, with its overriding promise to leave no one behind, requires particular attention and international support to middle-income countries. it is precisely this group of countries that hosts five out of the worid's total seven billion peopie, that wieids the greatest potential for economic growth, and that is indispensable when it comes to ensuring global sustainability. on the other hand, it is within this group where the three quarters of the world's poor reside. it is the mics that are most vulnerable to such factors as global economic fluctuations, consequences of regional conflicts, natural and man-made catastrophes, climate upheavals, epidemics, which all combine to threaten social and economic stability and widen inequality. including at the regional and global levels. it is, thus, unfair that progress in development is being gaged exclusively on the basis of a per capita income. this criteria reflects neither economic, nor social, nor environmental specifics inherent to middle-income countries. it is obvious for belarus that the multidimensional nature of the challenges faced by the countries of this category, to which belarus also belongs, requires the application of multidimensional development criteria that will also be instrumental in designing the un system's result-oriented strategies. belarus hopes that the high-level meeting gathered to comprehensively discuss these issues, which the president of the un general assembly plans to convene ver^' soon, will produce a serious impetus for the united nations to proceed with specific measures. ladies and gentlemen, today, another multidimensional issue is increasingly coming into our focus. humanity has entered a new age as digital technologies drastically change our lives. the importance of digital economics for sustainable and inclusive economic growth is well grasped in our country. last march, the presidential decree ""on the development of the digital economy"", whose ambition is to turn belarus in an ""it-country"", has entered into force. the belarus' park of high technologies has been growing fast, demonstrating record high rates of growth in residents and exports alike. digital technologies are fairly compared with ""rocket fuel"" for national economies. they make rapid absorption of innovation into human activities, including education, consumption, and social cooperation feasible. moreover, digital technologies stimulate business activity, they generate significant revenues, and they create new jobs. at the same time, the digitization cleariy ieads to drastic changes in the labor market, doing away in the process with a whole array of professions unrequired in the new environment, thereby making many people involved in the relevant sectors and industries extremely vulnerable. clearly, governments in advanced as well as in many developing countries will confront soon a number of tasks, specifically, how to adjust their own economies to the global digital transformation, how to manage these processes at the national level effectively, and how to cope with inadvertent ramifications spurred by digitization. with this in mind, belarus proposes to engage in international cooperation on digitization and technological foresight in ways that facilitate sustainable development. the purpose of this cooperation is to assist developing countries in finding a niche of their own in the global digital economy, to multiply the benefits stemming from digitization, and to make sure that they are to be distributed in an equal and fair manner. we thus welcome the establishment by the secretary-general of the high-level panel on digital cooperation and hope that the panel will pay particular attention to building states' capacities in this area. it is absolutely clear that strengthening such capacities would be fruitless unless the effort is predicated on such values as sustainability and prosperity for all. it is precisely these values that profoundly underlie those tasks that the worid's countries can accomplish cnly together. unfortunately, it is also these values that have often been sacrificed to the logic of confrontational thinking, which we encounter more and more. at the 2015 un summit the president of belarus contended that sustainable development would be unattainable in the absence of a lasting peace and security. the point is utterly relevant today. true sustainability cannot be achieved outside the security framework, which is being tested for resilience day in and day out. ail share in the threat posed by terrorism. combatting it effectively requires embracing a comprehensive approach whereby all countries uphold the principles of international law and shun double standards. we welcome and stand willing to support the un leaders' efforts to build a single front against terrorism. our country's contribution to the relevant global unifying processes will be a high-level international conference on preventing terrorism in the digital age, organized by belarus and the osce, which is to be held in minsk in a week's time (9-10 october). ladies and gentlemen, speaking about international security generally, one cannot help taking note once again of something evident. the world is facing today unprecedented challenges and threats. the confrontation in international relations increasingly evokes the notion of a new ""cold war. what is more, one increasingly hears the voices about likelihoods under which weapons of mass destruction may be used, even if as a result of an inadvertent conflict or an accident. this points to the crisis of diplomacy and seriously undermines the un authority as the key international organization tasked with preventing international conflicts. the ""degree"" of divergence in relations among a number of great dowers has reached a ""boiling"" point. when it comes to some issues, the situation reaches the point of absurdity. the un's principal organs, first and foremost, the security council are turned into an arena for confrontation and political self-assertion, with confrontation prevailing over dialog, and geopolitical ambitions taking the upper hand vis-a-vis common sense. like many in this hall, i, regrettably, do not have recipes for how to mend the matters. but we are deeply convinced: there is no choice other than to forge a global order on the basis of ""shared values"". it is patently clear, however, that it is impossible to arrive at ""shared values"" by rneans of coercive ""democratization"" and violence that are invoked for the purpose of undermining legitimate authorities. the bitter geopolitical experience accumulated over the past three decades tells us that something in which all of us have a common interest should constitute the foundation for such values. we think that the idea of stability may serve as this paradigm. bringing stability means stopping the unwinding spiral of geopolitical chaos in its tracks. what needs to be done to this end? first, what stability implies is that states retain their role as the primary international actors and that state sovereignty is respected. the contemporary international law is predicated on these key principles enshrined in basic united nations documents. in its essence, it is about, on the one hand, the right of states to choose their own form of political governance, as well as their own path and priorities of development, while, on the other hand, it is about non-interference of countries in each other's internal affairs. unfortunately, these principles are not universally adhered to. the politics of sanctions, economic coercion and political isolation against so called ""rogue regimes"" has found a solid ground in many countries' foreign policy toolkits. we have all been witnesses to decades-long policies of economic, trade and financial blockade applied against a freedom-loving cuba, which not only run counter to un resolutions, but take a heavy toll on that country's social and economic development. second, stability is also about strengthening the state, as well as its role in domestic affairs. we are absolutely convinced that only a ""strong"" state can provide security and wellbeing for its population. we believe that people living in places where ""real"" authority is absent, can bear out this truth better than anyone else. therefore, if we really have an interest in ensuring global stability, we should not undermine the state, but must rather contribute to making it stronger. finally, stability very much relates to relations among great powers, which today must learn once again to listen to others and hear others' arguments. in addition to be willing to embrace reasonable compromises. in the past, it was great powers that had determined the destinies of the world. today, they certainly do not enjoy such an exclusive prerogative. still, unity among great powers in relation to ""shared values"" and their leadership in advancing them is the sina quo non for progress in many areas. guided by this logic. president of belarus alexander lukashenko came up last year with the initiative to begin a comprehensive international security dialog. its objective is to overcome existing controversies that plague inter-state relations in the euro atlantic and eurasia. we are convinced that only dialog can help resolve the deep crisis of trust in international relations and produce mechanisms conducive to peace and international security, as well as to sustainable development. mr. president, can one day or one meeting change history? the great indian leader jawaharlal nehru called this moment a ""tryst with destiny"". i think that the common task lying before us is to increase the number of such moments. namely, what we must do is, by means of a common effort, to seek common solutions that will be acceptable to everyone. thank you for your kind attention.","vladimir makei, minister for foreign relations of belarus, pointing to the endorsement of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the paris agreement on climate change, said the international community will soon green light two instruments that will inspire hope for change: the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and the global compact on refugees. the implementation of these initiatives will ensure that globalization is equitable. because the search for answers to global challenges clearly shows no country can act alone, the united nations must continue to act as an efficient tool for multilateral cooperation. further, achieving the goals of the 2030 agenda requires effective united nations country teams, he said. pursuing globalization for the common good is a key objective that faces geopolitical and geo-economics fault lines, he continued. a “civilizational trap” is emerging that fosters confrontation. belarus, located at the heart of europe, is squeezed between two geopolitical power centers; conflict in ukraine impacts its economic development. his country is heavily dependent on external markets and supports a fair international trade architecture. his government is particularly interested in cooperation between the eurasia economic union and european union, he said, pointing to national approaches that foster integration and economic growth. in addition, development that leaves nobody behind requires support for middle‑income countries, home to 5 billion people and 75 per cent of the world’s poor. it is unfair that progress in development is gaged exclusively based on per capita income. humanity is entering a new era as digital technology drastically transforms lives, he noted. belarus is pursuing policies that will transform it into a leading information technology country. digital technologies are “rocket fuel” for economic development and improve education and stimulate business activity. however, digital markets will affect labor markets and countries will have to adapt their economies to the looming changes. the united nations should establish international cooperation networks on digitization and sustainable development so that countries can find their own niche. capacity building in this field is impossible without basing such efforts on principles of sustainability and prosperity. true sustainability cannot be maintained without security, he underscored, welcoming united nations efforts to mount a common front against terrorism. belarus will convene a high‑level meeting on combating terrorism in the context of a digitizing world. the world faces unprecedented threats and challenges that could lead to a new cold war. these threats point to a crisis in international diplomacy and divergent views among certain countries. the united nations is becoming a stage for confrontation. stability means ending geopolitical chaos while respecting state sovereignty and non‑interference in the affairs of other nations. only strong states can support security and the safety of their populations, he said, adding that belarus is promoting dialog to pursue peace and stability between euro‑atlantic and eurasian states. reflecting on whether one day or one meeting can change history, he cited the great indian leader jawaharlal nehru who called this moment a ""tryst with destiny"". “the common task lying before us is to increase the number of such moments,” he said."
Belgium,,"charles michel, prime minister of belgium, recalled that unilateral actions and a lack of dialog led to the horror of two world wars. the universal values of freedom, rule of law and democracy remain the best safeguards for fundamental human rights and freedom. multilateralism is not an empty concept but rather the conviction that tireless dialog is key, he said, further describing it as the choice of the battle of ideas and arguments over the battle of arms. multilateralism requires patience, but it is the only way to eradicate poverty, push out terrorists and preserve resources. he expressed regret that agreements born of intense and difficult negotiations like the paris agreement and the joint comprehensive plan of action can be unilaterally tossed aside. “trust and cooperation between sovereign nations implies respect for promises and commitments that were made,” he said, underlining that prior to the signing of the joint action plan, iran was on the brink of acquiring nuclear weapons. while noting that the plan is not comprehensive as it does not cover ballistic missiles, he said those who criticize it should seek to open a new chapter of multilateral cooperation to improve it. belgium has been elected as a non-permanent member of the security council for the upcoming two‑year period, he noted, pledging to expand dialog, fuel transparent and respectful debates, and work in favor of prosperity, security and respect for the planet. he called for a regular assessment of each peacekeeping mission’s contribution to long‑term political stability, adding that “the presence of blue helmets on the ground cannot become a screen for political resignation, neither in conflict zones nor on the regional or international level”. for centuries, trade has been promoting peace between peoples. freedom of trade must be based on fair and healthy competition with ambitious social and environmental standards. he welcomed the results of the fair trade agreement that was recently concluded between the european union and canada. underlining that before 2050, the african continent will have 2.5 billion inhabitants, he called for an ambitious free‑trade agreement and a win‑win comprehensive partnership between europe and africa. underscoring that climate change knows no borders and that natural resources are limited, he criticized the obstinacy of those who deny it, comparing them to those who used to say the earth is flat. natural disasters are increasingly large in scale and deadly, and climate change will cause and aggravate conflicts, he warned, citing the situation in west africa where access to potable water has increased tensions. “in the face of this existential threat, for our children, we must assume shared responsibility,” he said, calling for the implementation of the paris agreement. while the importance of the migration issue has taken an unprecedented scale, he stressed the need to “remove migration out of the hands of human traffickers, who are modern day slave traders”. orderly and legal mechanisms for international migration must be improved. the global compact is a step in the right direction. noting that extremists of all sides are taking advantage of migration issues for political or financial gains, he stressed that peace is the international community’s most important asset; but it requires vigilance. the challenges the world faces today have no boundaries and no country alone can overcome them, he said, reaffirming his faith in multilateralism."

delegations distinguished ministers excellencies at the outset i wish to express the sympathies of the government and people of belize with the government and people of indonesia in view of the devastating earthquake and tsunami which killed over 00 persons. at the same, i wish to also express belize s solidarity with barbados which is recovery from tropical storm kirk and with countries of the eastern caribbean which were affected by an earthquake - all over the last few days. madame president, this year marks the 37th anniversary of belize s independence. belizeans have now enjoyed almost four uninterrupted decades of freedom, peace and democracy in a sovereign independent nation. during that period our leaders succeeded in making modest gains in our nation's quest for sustainable development. they did so notwithstanding the fact that our country has been the subject of a live territorial claim, a poisoned colonial legacy, which pre-dates our grant of independence by approximately one half century. because of that claim, our nation's birth was protracted and fraught with difficulty. all belizeans who are seized of the history of our journey to independence greatly credit the united nations for it. and rightly so. it was resolution 151 of this general assembly passed on the 14 december i960, which paved the way for all colonial peoples to be able to transition to independence. belize is a beneficiary of that seminal resolution and of subsequent un resolutions passed between the period 1971 to 1980 which mandated the british to grant it early independence. on 21 september 1981, belize achieved its independence and no sooner than it had done so, the united nations welcomed our fledgling democracy as a member, affirming its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. thirty-seven years hence, guatemala still maintains a territorial claim to our country. the opportunity to have the guatemalan claim resolved at the international court of justice (icj) eluded the british government for upward of eighty years. belizeans themselves will soon decide whether the opportunity to bring to a definitive settlement a claim, which has long sown fear in the hearts of all belizeans and which has hamstrung our nation's development potential, will in fact be seized. 1 the significance of the guatemalan referendum, which ratified the decision of their government in 2008 to cause their claim to my country to be adjudicated by the icj, should not be lost. for in carrying out the referendum, guatemala gave effect to their obligation under the special agreement that both our ountries signed in good faith. at the same time, there is still a pending issue for us to agree on. in continuing that spirit of good faith, we urge guatemala to agree on a procedure or protocol for confidence building measures on the sarstoon river, our southern boundary with guatemala, to facilitate the management of incidents of the kind that gave rise to heightened tensions in 2015 and 2016 between our two countries. belizeans are on the cusp of a truly rare and felicitous moment in our nation s history. our voting public, in the finest democratic fashion, is now seized of a once in a lifetime opportunity, to determine the fate of our country. the government of belize has appointed april 10, 2019 as the date for the national referendum. all registered voters will be entitled to cast their ballots signaling either their consent or rejection to having the guatemalan claim resolved once and for all by the icj. in preparation for that first historic plebiscite our government has embarked upon a national wide public awareness campaign to ensure that all belizeans are fully informed about the nature of the claim and why it should be referred to the icj for resolution. simultaneously with efforts to end the guatemalan claim and thereby enhance our national security, our government continues to discharge its core duty to promote economic development, job creation, education and healthcare to our citizens. to that end we are striving mightily to implement our growth and sustainable development strategy, which is fully aligned to the sustainable development goals. in this endeavor the un development system is partnering with us through the multi country sustainable development framework. we are also working assiduously to address the scourge of poverty, which persistently afflicts our citizenry. current statistics reveal that some 3% of belizeans live below the poverty line with 16% experiencing extreme poverty. the interventions to treat with this problem include three new programs, which specifically target indigent families. in addition to furnishing beneficiaries with financial benefits, direct economic, social and psychological support are also provided, as well as job readiness courses, to prepare beneficiaries for gainful employment. under a food pantry program basic food baskets are provided at subsidized rates to poor families as well. madame president an alarming knowledge gap is rapidly widening between the few fortunate belizeans who are well educated, skilled and poised to succeed in a fiercely competitive, knowledge based, twenty first century environment and the many who are being left behind without the skills and wherewithal to obtain employment, or to create their own, or even to engage legitimately or meaningfully in civic life. it is indispensable to belize s development, prosperity, security and 2 democracy that we urgently seek to close this knowledge gap, and ensure that all our youth are equipped to successfully to face the myriad challenges of the 21st century. to that end and with a view to increasing access to education, government is building 35 new schools. consequent upon the initiation of a high school subsidy grant there is now a discernible improvement in rates of transition from primary to secondary school for students identified as having academic or socioeconomic challenges. all students in the districts and rural areas of the country with the highest incidence of poverty automatically qualify for that subsidy. and, this year, government is expanding the reach of the subsidy with the intention of minimizing the disparity in enrollment and achievement between students coming from rural areas and those hailing from urban ones. in addition government is taking new measures to assist youths at risk of coming into the contact with the law. we have recently launched the belize youth challenge program. this program concentrates on teaching youths discipline, personal administration and teamwork, and skills in technical and vocational areas. it also encourages them to become responsible, patriotic and productive citizens. with a view to enhancing the delivery of health services government is exploring the construction of a modern hospital in the toledo district. madame president, 2019 will mark twenty five years of the united nations support to the sids agenda. belize joins in the call for a renewed commitment to the special case of sids and for systematically targeted support to respond to the particular needs of sids such as those identified by the caribbean sids in the san pedro declaration adopted in belize in august. the destructive hurricanes and storms, which ravage the caribbean year on year, are a constant reminder of the true scale of vulnerability facing sids in the caribbean. it is hoped that through the implementation of his reform plan, the secretary general will explore ways in which.the un development system can better accelerate the implementation of the sids agenda. our, government has made resilience building an integral part of its development planning and is implementing its national climate resilience investment plan to ensure that climate change-related impacts are integrated into national investment planning across all sectors and ministries. government has also enacted mangrove regulations and instituted an indefinite moratorium on offshore drilling. this marks the first time that a developing country has taken such a major 3 step to protect its marine resources from oil exploration and extraction. belize is also banning single use plastics and styrofoam by april 2019. i m happy to share that the world heritage committee of unesco decided to remove the belize barrier reef-the largest in the western hemisphere - from the list of world heritage in danger, after taking into account several measures that our government has implemented to ensure its protection and wellbeing. madame president, by dint of geography belize is located along the path frequented by criminal elements of every ilk as they journey from south to north to traffic their wares. this has had tragic consequences for the peace and safety of belizeans. our homicide rates have been dramatically increasing over the last decade, with each year deadlier than the previous. tackling transnational organized crime in central america requires a truly cooperative and collaborative approach along with multilateral support. thankfully, unicef, undp and unodc have been important and faithful collaborators with government in implementing programs to address underlying social causes as well as building capacity of protective and judicial institutions. madame president, from the foregoing it is pellucid that the united nations is essential for belize. belize, like other members of the united nations is not unaware of its limitations. but it is not without some measure of anxiety, that we note the fact that some of its core values are under attack sustained while organs that have been painstakingly erected to reinforce the rule of law are being derided and, international legal frameworks are being cast aside in unilateral acts of political expediency. paradoxically, however, the criticisms and attacks are being unleashed at a time when the world is most in need of a robust united nations, as nations large and small are being buffeted by catastrophic occurrences, both natural and man-made, at a pace never before witnessed by humanity. thus, while we appreciate the need for reform of the un institutions we are equally mindful of its unique and invaluable role in a world that is becoming increasingly more perilous. belize fears that if we stand in silence or fail to speak out in its defense and in defense of multilateralism, we risk repeating the tragedies of the past. and we forsake the very values that the united nations stands for. indeed we forsake our very responsibility to humanity. history will measure us by actions not by words. 4 madame president, belize is supportive of all initiatives to put an end to languishing conflicts across the globe, which conduce to senseless death, destruction and suffering. we echo the cry of palestinians for an independent state, within its 1967 borders, and with all attendant rights. we pray that the icj will bring a speedy end to venezuela s claim over guyana territory. belize remains firm, unswerving in its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of guyana. we pray as well that the civil strife in venezuela will soon be ended. belize joins the call for an end to the unilateral, economic, commercial and financial embargo against cuba and its people, which is in violation of international law and serves no just purpose. the blockade has failed to pressure the government into submission. indeed it has had the opposite effect. leveraging its inexhaustible reserves of patriotism and creativity, cuba has been able to survive and thrive to a degree that has garnered international recognition; especially for its signal gains in public health, education and the arts. surely, it is high time, after nearly 58 years, to lift the blockade so that cuba can reach the highest level of its extraordinary potential. in a similar spirit of determination, belize once again reiterates its plea on behalf of the 23 million people of taiwan for a new approach to the participation of taiwan in the united nations system. taiwan is the 22nd largest economy of the world. it is a vibrant democracy that has fully embraced international norms and standards. yet, despite global recognition of their successes and despite the readiness of un member states to conduct business with this fast growing economy, this institution has cut them off. it has gone so far as to refuse to recognize the legitimacy of taiwanese passports and so literally cutting off even the taiwanese tourists from entering its premises as visitors. it uses general assembly resolution 2758 of 1971 effectively as a political and humanitarian embargo against taiwan. no such embargo, indeed, has any place in this united nations. madame president, the successes of the united nations have never been won by focusing on what divides us. had we done so, we would not have achieved a landmark human rights declaration, a transformative development agenda or a constitution for the oceans and seas, and we certainly would not have a framework agreement for collective action on climate change. focusing on what unites us can bring us further along to address the gaps in the law of the sea to guarantee that equitability persists even in areas beyond national jurisdiction. in the same manner, we can in poland take the final decisions to give full effect to the paris agreement and mobilize momentum for the level of ambition and the magnitude of support needed to avoid irreversible adverse impacts of climate change. belize is ready to commit to 5 raising our ambition and urge others to join us in 2020 to set the world on the right path to achieve the paris agreement goals. madame president, belize has weathered many trials in our humble defense of what rightly belongs to us. we see our struggle reflected in those of many others who have been denied the full enjoyment of their rights, and the full achievement of their potential. we are however fortified in the belief that right will triumph. that in the end, our shared values of justice and our belief in human dignity, will bring us ever so closer to the solutions the world needs. so we march on, in service of the united nations, and all the world s peoples, armed with our values, and the enduring hope for peace and security. thankyou 6","wilfred elrington, minister for foreign affairs of belize, noting that the current year marks the thirty-seventh anniversary of the country’s independence, said that belizeans have now enjoyed almost four uninterrupted decades of freedom, peace and democracy in a sovereign independent nation. during that period, the country’s leaders succeeded in making modest gains in sustainable development, notwithstanding a poisoned colonial legacy. acknowledging the united nations role in the country’s journey to independence, he remembered assembly resolution 1514, and subsequent resolutions which mandated the british to grant belize independence. however, he said, thirty-seven years hence, guatemala still maintains a territorial claim to the country. “our voting public, in the finest democratic fashion is now seized of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to determine the fate of the country,” he said, noting that his government has appointed 10 april 2019 as the date for

claim, he went on, the government continues to promote economic development, job creation, education and health care. poverty persists in belize and current statistics reveal that 43 per cent of belizeans live below the poverty line. the government is targeting the problem with new programs, including a food pantry and a job readiness course. further, the government is building 35 new schools and offering a high school subsidy grant. the recently launched belize youth challenge program focuses on imparting life skills to youth at risk of involvement in crime. noting the range of natural disasters that ravage the caribbean every year, he said that building resilience is an integral part of the country’s development planning, as evidenced by the national climate resilience investment plan. by dint of geography, he noted, belize is located along the path frequented by criminal elements of every ilk as they journey from the south to the north to traffic their wares. tackling transnational crime in central america requires a truly collaborative approach, he said, expressing gratitude to the united nations children’s fund (unicef), united nations development program (undp)

Benin,,"jean-claude félix do rego (benin) said that with a world in the grip of crises, the united nations must work together with great determination. indeed, the international community must commit to work together to find suitable long‑term solutions to contemporary crises. international relations should be based on the increasingly close cooperation of states and the harmonious functioning of international organizations, focused on common interests and international security. in that regard, benin welcomed the conclusion of the global compact for migration and looks forward to its adoption in marrakech. that achievement demonstrated the power of multilateralism and the international community’s ability to agree on issues that went beyond national sovereignty. turning to development, he said the acceleration of the implementation of the sustainable development agenda is a key priority. improving governance is a “sine qua non” for achieving the sustainable development goals. with a strengthened legal arsenal to address economic crimes and terrorism, the fight against corruption is at the heart of his government’s work, he said, noting that this is necessary to ensure that financial resources are really used toward their stated ends. at the same time, his government is working to ensure better health care for its population and has begun a fight against a scourge of falsified medicines circulating in his country. meanwhile, his country is also focused on developing its tourism sector and will develop flagship projects in that area to create the conditions for tourism to become a key driver of growth. peace and international security is a foreign policy priority, he said, calling peacekeeping one of the “most important tools of the united nations”. even though benin has limited means, the country has been involved in several international initiatives to prevent crises and help keep peace. as such, it looks forward to reforms to the security pillar of the united nations. he hailed the zero‑tolerance policy of the united nations to combat sexual exploitation before expressing concern about dwindling resources in peacekeeping. “doing more with less” is not suitable given the increasingly complex challenges facing peacekeeping operations today, he said."
Bhutan,"kingdom of bhutan statement by ho . chief justice, lyonpo tshering wangchuk, chief advisor of the interim government of bhutan 73rd session of the general assembly general debate united nations, new york 27 september 2018 0 madam president, mr. secretary general, distinguished delegates, i have the honor to convey the greetings of his majesty the king of bhutan to this august gathering and his best wishes for the success of this 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. i also wish to congratulate her excellency maria fernanda espinosa garces, on being elected as the president of the current session of the general assembly and assure your excellency of bhutan s full support. the kingdom of bhutan, commends his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak for the successful completion of the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly. i seek your indulgence, please allow me to share bhutan’s observations on some of the key issues before us today: 1. un reforms excellencies, bhutan welcomes and supports the secretary general antonio guterres’s ambitious and timely agenda to reform the united nations development system, which is in sync with agenda 2030 to make the un more relevant and fit for purpose . we also welcome the draft implementation plan by the un deputy secretary general for the inception of the new resident coordinator system. we have ta en note of the appeal to member states for the front-loaded voluntary contribution to the special trust fund to cover the immediate gap of the cost of a reinvigorated resident coordinator system. in this regard, bhutan will be making a token voluntary contribution towards the trust fund. following the wider reforms of the un system, the reform of the united nations security council (unsc) must also go hand in hand. the reform must accommodate the interest and concerns of all the member states, particularly of those unrepresented and underrepresented with a view to reflecting the realities of a vastly changed global environment. the membership of the un has increased fourfold and the challenges we face today have become far more complex. therefore, the institution must adapt, evolve and remain relevant in order to address the growing challenges of our times and fulfill our common aspirations for a more equitable, inclusive and sustainable world. 1 2. 2030 agenda for sustainable development excellencies, the reforms of the un geared towards implementing agenda 2030, must provide the essential impetus to galvanize support for progress in areas that have been found to be deficient - to meet the goals and targets within the set time-frame of 2030. i am happy to share that bhutan is well on-track to implementing the sustainable development goals. with happiness and well-being of our people at the center of our development efforts, bhutan s development model of gross national happiness resonates well with the objectives of agenda 2030. the repositioning of sustainable development, which is at the heart of the united nation s principle of leaving-no-one-behind , is also in tandem with bhutan’s national development priorities. bhutan presented its voluntary national review (vnr) on the implementation of the sdg targets at the high-level political forum in new york in july this year. the review enabled us to assess the progress in the implementation of the targets and achievements against our development endeavors. i thank the member states for their keen interest and valuable feedback. 3. ldc graduatio excellencies, my country - a tiny landlocked country in the himalayas - started its planned development only in 1961. under the visionary leadership of our monarchs, industrious people and generous assistance from our development partners, bhutan today is poised to graduate from the least developed countries category. we successfully completed our second triennial review of the committee for development policy n march 2018 and have been recommended for graduation in 2023. on behalf of the royal government, i would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all our development partners for their friendship, generosity and support. while we have achieved two of the three thresholds to be eligible to graduate from the ldc category for two successive triennials, we have not been able to achieve the economic vulnerability index threshold. bhutan continues to face serious challenges in terms of its narrow economic base and vulnerability to natural disasters. the economic and structural impediments to growth - are also reported in the vulnerability profile of bhutan by united nations conference on trade and development (unctad). 2 bhutan looks forward to undertake its graduation from ldc in a sustainable manner by building productive capacity and economic resilience to ensure, there is no back slippage on the hard-earned development gains. the pace of graduation must be able to absorb the withdrawal of international support measures. smooth transition is thus critical to ensure that - graduation is sustainable and does not disrupt the ongoing development plans and processes. the forthcoming 12th five-year national development plan (2018-2023) is critical as it is bhutan s last plan as an ldc and will serve as our transition strategy for graduation. efforts during the period will focus on consolidating past progress and addressing the remaining last mile challenges - to build a strong foundation for a vibrant, resilient and sustainable economy towards achieving sdgs. the u secretary general s report on the progress towards the sdgs 2018 has underscored that ldcs remain far below many of the sdg targets. ultimately the success of agenda 2030 with its promise of leaving-no-one-behind"" hinges on the performance of the ldcs. 4. climate change excellencies, climate change due to global warming, and human activity is not only a serious threat to humanity but also to sustainable development. action is needed at international, regional, national and local levels to combat this menace. the impacts of climate change affect the poorer countries and poorer people disproportionately, as they are not able to adapt or deal with its impacts. since, mitigating climate change means reducing emission of greenhouse gasses, which is emitted from consumpt on of energy for all economic and household activities, it affects everyone and is tied to economic and energy security issues. the ever-increasing environmental pressures from climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, soil degradation, air and water pollution, among others, have far reaching economic and social consequences, which contribute to poverty and to growing social inequalities. the 2030 agenda for sustainable development rightly provides a unique opportunity to ensure that sustainable development is based on the rule of law - with the focus on environmental rule of law, being central to sustainable development. planet earth cannot and must not be the monopoly of homo sapiens - it is an abode for all sentient beings. the buddhist tenet associated with conservation and protection of the five elements of this planet will remain as our single hope for survival and refuge for our posterity. natural disasters such as the recent hurricanes and typhoons that struck the united states, the philippines, china and japan, and the devastating flood in kerala, india are not isolated incidents. how many more incidents like these do 3 we need? how many more experts do we need, to convince us that natural disasters are aggravated by climate change? i believe devastation and destruction from extreme weather conditions alone cost the world around usd 330 billion in 2017. climate change also threatens to push 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030. climate change refugees on a large scale will certainly become a reality. therefore, we must act now and ensure that international support to tackle climate change - galvanized through the landmark paris agreement does not waver at any cost. this is the international community s moral responsibility to the millions of people around the world, especially those in the developing world who are disproportionately affected. bhutan has also been affected by extreme weather phenomena with increased frequency of natural disasters such as glacial lake outburst floods (glof), flash floods, windstorms and landslides. all these have had serious impacts on the assets and livelihood of our people and the hard-earned development gains. bhutan s leadership in sustainable development and environmental stewardship has been recognized globally. we are fortunate that the past investments in environmental conservation are reaping climate dividends. our 72.6% forest cover not only serve as a carbon sink for greenhouse gas emissions but also provide valuable ecosystem services of clean water for drinking, agriculture and hydropower generation. bhutan remains committed to uphold its 2009 commitment to remain carbon neutral and reaffirms its pledge to fulfilling its commitments to the paris agreement for climate change. 5. un peacekeeping operations excellencies, although being a small developing country, with a population of little over half a million, bhutan has always worked constructively with other member states to realize the noble objectives of the united nations since its membership in 1971. among others, bhutan remains fully committed to the cause of international peace and security, which is one of the key mandates and objectives of the united nations. bhutan joined the fraternity of troops and police contributing countries in 2014 to play a meaningful role towards maintaining international peace and security. it is a testimony of our commitment to share the burden along with other members states. since then, bhutan has been working towards gradually broadening and deepening our engagement in the un peacekeeping operations. 4 i i am happy to inform that bhutan became the first country to sign the rapid deployment level agreement (rdl) with the un department of peacekeeping operations in december 2017. bhutan has also pledged an integrated formed police unit (fpu). as such, bhutan stands ready to deploy a contingent, whenever, the united nations calls upon us to do so. 6. events in bhutan excellencies, in 2008, bhutan transitioned from an absolute benevolent monarchy to a democratic constitutional monarchy - a meaningful, deliberate and purposeful progression. the democratic changes in bhutan evolved through an internal process and not through external pressure or revolution. with the adoption of the constitution in 2008, our monarchs have devolved the responsibilities of safeguarding our sovereignty and security to the bhutanese people. since then we have witnessed two elected governments. the term of the second elected government concluded in august 2018 and the third parliamentary elections are underway in bhutan. the primary round of elections just concluded on 15 september and the general round of elections will be held on 18 october. we expect to have the next government in place by early november 2018. over the past decade, our monarchs and our people have established a strong foundation for a functional, vibrant and intelligent democracy within the tapestry of constitutionalism and the rule of law. as we look to the future, bhutan will continue working with member states to ensure that the united nations continues to play a key role in promoting peace, security and solidarity. in this regard, i wish to conclude with a quote from our beloved king, his majesty jigme khesar namgyel wangchuck: there cannot be enduring peace, prosperity, equality and brotherhood in this world, if our aims are so separate and divergent, if we do not accept that in the end, we are people, all alike, sharing the earth among ourselves and also with other sentient beings, all of whom have an equal role and stake in the state of this planet and its players . i wish the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly every success. thank you and tashi delek! 5","lyonpo tshering wangchuk, chief adviser of the interim government of bhutan, said that the reform of the united nations, including the security council, must focus on accommodating the interests and concerns of all member states, particularly the unrepresented and underrepresented. bhutan is well on track to implementing the 2030 agenda. as a tiny landlocked country in the himalayas, bhutan started its development in 1961. while it has achieved two of the three thresholds to be eligible to graduate from the group of least developed countries, it was not able to achieve the economic vulnerability index threshold. bhutan continues to face serious economic challenges and vulnerability to natural disasters. graduation from the group of least developed countries must be done in a sustainable manner by building productive capacity and economic resilience, he said, stressing the need to ensure that there is no back slippage on hard‑earned development gains. graduation must be sustainable without disrupting ongoing development plans. the ever‑increasing environmental pressures from climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, soil degradation, and air and water pollution have far‑reaching economic and social consequences, which contribute to poverty and social inequality. “earth cannot and must not be the monopoly of homo sapiens,” he said, recalling a buddhist tenet associated with conservation and protection of the five elements of the planet. he called on leaders to tackle climate change and expressed support for the paris agreement. as a small developing country with a population of half a million people, bhutan remains fully committed to the cause of international peace and security. it has also been working towards gradually broadening and deepening engagement with united nations peacekeeping operations. since bhutan’s 2008 transition from an absolute benevolent monarchy to a democratic constitutional monarchy, it has had two elected governments, he continued. the term of the second elected government concluded last month and the third parliamentary elections are under way. the primary round of elections just concluded on 15 september; the general round of elections are slated for 18 october, and the new government is planned to be sworn in by early november. over the past decade, the people of bhutan have focused on establishing a strong, functional and intelligent democracy, he added."
Bolivia (Plurinational State of),,"evo morales ayma, president of bolivia, said that men, women and children in the world expect our debate here to have an outcome and results to improve their lives. citing the theme of this year’s session — making the united nations relevant to all people — he said we must resolve issues by peaceful means, referring to the case his country had sent to the international court of justice for chile to negotiate with bolivia for the sovereign access to the pacific ocean. the hemispheric importance of that dispute is recognized by the organization of american states. hoping to end the 100‑year‑old dispute between the neighbors, he noted the negative impact of having access denied to the pacific ocean. it has greatly affected its human development and denied its access to the huge resources of the sea. “a human being needs the sea, you cannot have life on land without water,” he said, calling it a window to other people and life itself and regretting that bolivia is now landlocked. unfortunately, we come together here every year, yet many of the crises are getting worse and more serious, he said. while referring to several major current challenges, he cited climate change, the arms race and a nuclear disaster, and inequality. addressing climate change, he pointed out that each year is getting hotter than before, harsher phenomena are occurring, and more people are affected by hurricanes, droughts, flooding and pollution. tackling the structural causes are essential. the largest polluter in history, the united states, has turned its back on science, and thus on humanity. climate change is an inevitable result of capitalism. “the planet is being exhausted and life, too,” he said. on the arms race and a possible nuclear disaster, he noted many leaders concerned come here and talk about peace. addressing the inequality of wealth, he deplored the fact that wealth is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. he pointed out that half of the human population saw no increase in income. he said that this is a model for accumulating wealth and not for alleviating poverty. he also stressed that the united states must provide reparations to cuba, lifting blockades and giving guantanamo back to cuba. on the people’s alternative revolutionary force (farc) and colombia, he expressed his hope for that country in protecting the lives of those who defended human rights. noting that venezuela suffered aggression by the united states, he said that that south american nation should be able to solve their own problems. condemning israel’s criminal occupation of palestinian territories, he reiterated his support for the two‑state solution. furthermore, he expressed his deep regrets for the war in syria costing the lives of more than half a million in the last 8 years, adding that bolivia rejects violation of independence and integrity of territory, including by the united states. war is the result of policies of regime change and interfering in internal affairs. he thanked the russian federation, iran, turkey and kazakhstan for their efforts to solve the crisis in syria. speaking of his own country, he noted that it got rid of united states military bases and the impositions of the international monetary fund (imf). furthermore, bolivia reduced poverty from 37 per cent to 17 per cent, increased life expectancy and reduced child mortality by 56 per cent. he listed initiatives to combat corruption and put an end to banking secrecy, providing the greatest possible transparency. he confirmed bolivia’s continued commitment to multilateralism, stressing that we must build a fairer and more just society for all. “we have only one planet. this is our home,” he stressed."
Bosnia and Herzegovina,"bosnia and herzegovina address by h.e. bakir izetbegovic chairman of the presidency of bosnia and herzegovina at the general debate of the 73'''^ session of the united nations general assembly new york,25 september 2018 madam president, mr. secretary-general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to address you for the fourth and final time as the chairman of the presidency of bosnia and herzegovina. i congratulate miroslav lajcak for his leadership of the it^ session of the general assembly. together with secretary-general guterres, he worked tirelessly to make this organization more effective. i am glad the agenda of this year's session will maintain focus on these efforts. i congratulate maria fernanda espinosa garces on her election. the fact that she is only the fourth woman to hold this position since 1946 is a reminder that gender equality and empowerment of women must remain our top priority. she can count on bosnia and herzegovina's full support in getting the work of the general assembly to be productive and impactful. madam president, two years ago,from this podium, i reflected on a number of ways and means to make our world more just and prosperous for all. standing here today, there is not much to rejoice about, in terms of progress we have made. challenges have continued to multiply uncontrollably. old conflicts have been magnified, and new ones have been created. compared to the past three decades, more countries are engulfed in crises that are more violent, more disruptive for development, and which result in ever greater divides. these modem crises and conflicts are rarely confined to their place oforigin. they shake entire regions, and often proliferate further into the transnational arena. record numbers of civilians are victims of indiscriminate yet deliberate armed attacks. many more are subjected to persecution, discrimination, marginalization and violations of basic human rights. many others fall victim to natural disasters. the number of refugees, displaced persons, and those in dire need of humanitarian assistance keeps rising. peace, security and prosperity remain merely a distant hope for so many human beings around the world. it is through this lens that i wish to reflect on three issues that are critical to addressing global problems we face: multilateralism, international law and the rules-based intemational order. for, i believe that adherence to multilateralism, compliance with international law and shared commitment to the rules-based global order,are our only hope and only way to resolve the complex challenges that confront us. whether it be conflict prevention or resolution, security, development, climate change, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, migrations or human rights - none of these problems can be successfully addressed and resolved by one, three, or five countries alone. each and every one of these issues has transnational dimensions. solving any of them requires transnational, multilateral responses that are based on dialog and cooperation between all nations. effective responses require an exercise in responsibility and respect for agreed international norms and standards, strong coalitions based on mutual trust, and a progressive, inclusive and democratic vision and leadership that embrace a new understanding of national sovereignty. yet, today, we are witnessing severe attacks on the rules-based international order, on the purposes, principles and norms of international law. these attacks pose a grave threat of undermining international peace and security. there are plenty of examples in our recent past showing what disregard for international law and the rules-based international order can bring. these dark chapters of our history were a direct result of the community of nations failing to uphold the rules and norms upon which the world order has been based, when these very same rules and norms were challenged. madam president, our citizens want to live in a peaceful world in which human dignity is respected and fundamental human rights and freedoms are protected. that is the raison d'etre of this organization. that obligation goes far beyond our national borders or interests. no government can focus only on delivering stability and prosperity to its own people, while ignoring what goes on beyond its national borders, in its neighborhood and in the wider world. to paraphrase franklin roosevelt, the structurefor solving any ofthe numerous challenges weface, including building andsustaining world peace, cannot be the work ofone man, one nation, large or small, but a cooperative effort ofthe whole world. these words resonate today as they did over seven decades ago. cooperative approaches have been key to eliminating smallpox, vaccinating record numbers of infants against preventable diseases, and beating back the menace ofhiv/aids. concerted efforts and the alliance of all the nations are necessary to contain the risks of nuclear confrontation and successfully address global issues, such as gender equality, climate change or prosecution of war criminals on the international level. the spirit of multilateralism is essential in order to bring and maintain peace, security and development around the world. a man who championed multilateralism in his life-long work on the world stage, former united nations secretary-general kofi annan, once said: ""more than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. we can master it only ifweface it together. and that is why we have the united nations."" we must reaffirm the organization of united nations as the true embodiment of multilateralism. it is the only forum that brings together 193 countries to seek joint solutions to global problems that affect us all. it is the only forum that has the capacity, dedication and compassion to solve these problems. it is the only forum where the voices of both big and small countries can be equally heard -even if all ofthose voices are not always equally acknowledged. bosnia and herzegovina is strongly committed to the preservation and strengthening of the organization of united nations, of its values and principles, of its mission and mandate, of its relevance, credibility and cohesion. to this end, we welcome and support efforts to reform this organization so that the voices of all its member states are more democratically represented in its deliberations and actions. madam president, time and again we must remind ourselves of the fundamental values and principles that are enshrined in the united nations charter, and that embody the essence of the rules-based international order. these principles and values remain equally relevant today as they were in 1945. the primary responsibility of this organization and all its member states is to uphold and protect these commitments in the face of the modem challenges that profoundly test them. upholding the rules-based global order and the rule oflaw in general is essential to preventing and resolving crises and to sustaining peace. strong leadership and engagement ofthe united nations, and especially its security council, in line with the norms of intemational law, is indispensable in situations like ukraine, syria, iraq and libya, and in other crisis areas. yet, our responses to modem crises and conflicts have unfortunately been marked by disregard for intemational law, departure from multilateralism and failure to adhere to the rules-based intemational order, by inaction and by indifference to human suffering and violations of basic human rights. take the middle east, for example. the conflict in syria has entered its eight year, and we are nowhere close to bringing it to a resolution. some of the most egregious and sustained violations of intemational humanitarian law in modem times, including indiscriminate use of chemical weapons, have gone unabated. civilian casualties are constantly on the rise; the humanitarian situation keeps deteriorating. the same applies to the israeli-palestinian conflict, which has lasted for more than half a century, and which has brought about immense human suffering. holding a region hostage, as individual national interest compromises the interests of civilians who are caught in the endless cycles of violence, is unacceptable. the national interest of any country cannot be justified when the most basic services and means to sustain life are lacking for a large segment of the population. bosnia and herzegovina will continue to support multilateral efforts to find solutions that would bring sustained peace and stability to the syrian people; that will meet the legitimate expectations of both the israelis and palestinians to have two democratic states, living side by side, within secure and recognized borders in line with international law. as much as finding such solutions is a political question, it is also a matter ofour common humanity. madam president, our shared ambition to leave no one behind is also put at serious risk by the evolving threat of radicalization, violent extremism and terrorism. this modem scourge easily finds fuel for its sustainment not only in armed conflicts, but also in social and political injustices, discrimination, marginalization and exclusion, in poverty, unemployment and economic disadvantage. violent extremism and terrorism transcend physical and virtual borders. they constantly change tactics and invent new ways and means to spread. extremists and terrorists remain intent on driving a wedge between and within societies, hindering our efforts to maintain peace and security, protect human rights and foster sustainable development. our response, therefore, must be decisive, coherent, comprehensive, and grounded in the international counterterrorism framework we have created. bosnia and herzegovina remains strongly committed to contributing to global efforts to counter and eradicate this modem menace in all its forms and manifestations. this is a profound challenge of our time that needs to be confronted at every step and by every means at our disposal. madam president, nuclear weapons and their proliferation continue to pose a grave threat to our civilization. that threat perhaps overshadows all the other ones combined. the stakes are as high as they have ever been. preventing nuclear proliferation and eliminating weapons of mass destruction concern the survival of humankind. madam president, the united nations peacebuilding architecture remains as important as ever in addressing all the challenges that persist on the path towards sustainable peace around the world. we recognize the value of introducing the united nations peacebuilding efforts at an early stage, alongside peacekeeping activities. bosnia and herzegovina supports the vision and efforts of secretarygeneral guterres to mainstream conflict prevention and peacebuilding as priorities of the united nations. as part of a comprehensive response, peacekeeping has proven to be an effective tool for the united nations to assist countries on the path from conflict to peace. bosnia and herzegovina is proud of our contribution to these goals, through our participation in the united nations peacekeeping missions in southern sudan,cyprus, afghanistan, congo and mali. we havejoined over 130 other countries and organizations in endorsing the secretary-general's declaration of shared commitments on un peacekeeping operations. we support his efforts to make the united nations peacekeeping missions stronger and more effective. madam president, agenda 2030 is the most powerful connector among the various pillars ofthe united nations work. its implementation is the most important pathway to global peace, security and prosperity. it will help our states and societies establish resilient institutions that are able to detect, manage and absorb tension, to address the drivers and root causes ofconflicts and prevent their recurrence, and to create conditions for inclusive and sustainable development by reducing poverty, inequality and discrimination, ensuring respect for human rights and combating environmental degradation. agenda 2030 is a catalyst for sustainable and inclusive development rooted in respect for economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. and that is the best prevention against conflicts and instability. madam president, strong global and regional cooperation, be it on matters of conflict prevention and resolution, the fight against terrorism or the implementation of agenda 2030, is essential for the success of all these efforts. bosnia and herzegovina strongly values the cooperation we have established within our region ofthe western balkans. we remain committed to advancing that cooperation,including on our joint path to membership in the european union. madam president, bosnia and herzegovina strives for protection and promotion of values and principles that are shared by all countries. we believe that the ideals, values and principles enshrined in the united nations charter and the norms and standards inscribed in international law should never be violated or disregarded. we believe it is the obligation of all countries, big and small, powerful or less so, to uphold the noble values and principles this organization is built upon. if any of us lack the will to uphold these values and principles, then all our endeavors will be less valuable and less successful. on that note, i leave you with the words ofa great man. nelson mandela,as we mark the centenary of his birth: ""what counts is not the merefact that we have lived. it is what difference we have made to the lives ofothers that will determine the significance ofthe life we lead.""","bakir izetbegović, chairman of the presidency of bosnia and herzegovina, called for putting gender equality and empowerment of women at the top of the agenda, noting that maría fernanda espinosa garcés, the president of the general assembly, is only the fourth woman to hold that position. he deplored the fact that much still must be done in terms of progress, adding that old conflicts have been magnified and new ones created. these crises shake entire regions. peace, security and prosperity remain a distant hope in the lives of victims of different kinds of crises like armed attacks, persecution, marginalization, human rights violations, natural hazards and migration, he said. he said that the adherence to multilateralism, international law and rules-based order is the only hope and way to resolve the current challenges like climate change, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, migrations, human rights, security and conflict resolution, stressing that all states must work together in dialog and cooperation in solving these issues. the dark chapters of our history are a direct result of the community of nations failing to uphold rules and norms, he said. respecting human dignity and protecting fundamental rights and freedoms of our citizens wanting to live in a peaceful world are the united nations raison d'être. “no government can focus only on delivering stability and prosperity to its own people while ignoring what goes on beyond its national borders,” he said. the united nations is the only forum where voices of small and large countries are heard equally. welcoming efforts of reforming the united nations, he voiced bosnia and herzegovina’s support and commitment. upholding the rules-based global order and rule of law, and strong leadership and engagement of the united nations, he said, are indispensable in crises areas such as ukraine, syria, iraq and libya, deploring that our responses are marked by inaction and indifference to human suffering and violations of human rights. he pointed to the middle east, syria being in its eighth year of crisis, the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons, the constant rise of civilian casualties and the deteriorating humanitarian situation. he also noted the israeli‑palestinian conflict lasting for more than 50 years and holding a region hostage, adding that national interest cannot be justified when a large segment of the population lacks basic services and means to sustain life. commenting on violent terrorism and extremism and the threat of radicalization, he stressed that the world’s response must be decisive, coherent, comprehensive and grounded in the international counter-terrorism framework. nuclear weapons and their proliferation remain a grave threat to our civilization, he said, adding that the stakes are as high as ever. its prevention and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction concern the survival of humankind. he voiced support for the secretary-general’s vision of mainstreaming conflict prevention and peacebuilding as united nations priorities, mentioning bosnia and herzegovina’s participation in peacekeeping missions in over 130 countries and organizations. on the 2030 agenda as the most powerful connector, he pointed to its implementation as the most important way to global peace, security and prosperity. he added that the agenda is a catalyst for sustainable and inclusive development rooted in respect for economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, and as the best prevention against conflicts and instability. the protection and promotion of the values and principles of the united nations is an obligation of all countries. “if any of us lack the will to uphold these values and principles, then all our endeavors will be less valuable and less successful,” he said"

clarion call for us to end extreme poverty and ensure provision of quality education, health employment for all. care, infrastructure, housing and madam president, 13. i am pleased that the sustainable development goals report of 2018 indicates that more people are living healthier lives than it was the case a decade ago. that notwithstanding, we should be reminded that much more still needs to be done to achieve prosperity for all. this is in view of fact that an estimated 783 million people live in extreme poverty and 2.3 billion people still lack access to basic level of sanitation service, while 4 billion people are without social protection. 14. it is therefore apparent that none of us, whether big or small, can overcome these gigantic development challenges alone. consequently, we multilateralism, as need to act well as, to together honor to strengthen and implement commitments made by this general assembly and global partnerships for sustainable development. 15. it is also imperative that the global community should continue to support individual countries given their unique development challenges. for instance, while botswana is classified as an upper middle income country, it is still confronted by many development challenges comparable to that of the less developed countries. however, we are reassured by the words of the un secretary-general when he opined that the united nations: ""stands ready to work with all member states to make the sustainable development goals a reality for everyone, everywhere"". 16. in view of the development challenges facing my country, i wish to reiterate our appeal for continued support in human capital, infrastructure and capacity development for the private sector and technology transfer. sustainable development madam president, 17. botswana reaffirms her commitment to the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. to this end, we have aligned our vision 2036 to this global agenda. at the regional level, we are also pleased that the african union agenda 2063 and the southern african development community (sadc) integration agenda is aligned to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development 18. what is common about these development agendas is that they are both aimed at eradicating poverty and creating inclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies. in this respect, we are pleased to note that extreme poverty continues to decline globally, even though we still have a long way to go given that 35®/o of the african population, or 395 million people, still live in abject poverty. 19. as we begin the third year of the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, my government remains steadfast in her resolve to improve the material and social well-being of our population. agenda places people, our planet, national prosperity, development peace and partnership at the heart of sustainable development. in this regard, our national vision 2036 is anchored on four pillars of sustainable economic development; human and social development; sustainable environment; and governance, peace and security. 20. in addition, we have six national priorities that are aligned to our national vision pillars, namely. developing diversified sources of economic growth; human capital development; social development; sustainable use of national resources; consolidation of good governance and strengthening implementation of evaluation system. of an national effective security; and monitoring and 21. in this way, our sustainable development pathway strikes a balance between social, human, economic, environmental and governance dimensions. 22. the implementation of our national vision 2035 and eleventh national development plan is underpinned by a robust monitoring and evaluation system to ensure effective delivery of goals and aspirations. 23. additionally, committee we to have established effectively a coordinate national steering implementation and monitoring of the sustainable development goals. we have also developed botswana sdgs roadmap: a guide to implementation of sustainable development goals, covering the period from 2017 to 2023. madam president, 24. my government has adopted a comprehensive and inclusive approach to the implementation and monitoring of sustainable development goals. this was aimed at ensuring broad ownership and leadership at local, community and national levels and to break silos across the development spectrum through forging strategic partnerships between government, academia. civil society organizations, community based organizations, development partners, private sector, non- state actors and the un system. 25. in pursuit of these goals and aspirations, we have prioritized economic diversification, sustainable economic growth, employment creation and investment in human capital for building a prosperous and inclusive society. 26. in particular, focus is on our young people, who constitute 60% of the population of botswana. to this end, our ultimate goal is to attain universal access to pre-primary, primary and secondary education. we are also expanding access to tertiary, technical and vocational education and training. 27. in addition, we are developing a national employment policy whose objectives are to assist botswana to achieve gainful and productive employment and decent work for all. 28. above all, the government of botswana has developed several policies, programs and strategies, such as; the economic diversification drive (edd), citizen economic empowerment policy, youth empowerment scheme (yes) and the youth development fund (ydf), to support sustainable economic development and employment creation. madam president, 29. to ensure that development is a benefit for all, my government continues to make substantial investments in the provision of health care, decent housing and shelter, through interventions such as, the treat all strategy, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hiv, self-help housing agency (shha) housing scheme and destitute housing program. 30. additionally, the government provides social protection to vulnerable groups such as children, youth, persons living with disabilities and the elderly, through the out of school children policy, orphan care program and the old age pension scheme. other development interventions aimed at increasing access to economic and social opportunities include poverty eradication, women and youth empowerment, and national policy on gender and development. 31. furthermore, we have prioritized investments in research and development, science, technology and innovation in order to transform botswana into a high-income status nation and knowledge-based economy. investment in information and communications technology (ict) is undertaken to promote growth and economic diversification and to support government service and innovation in the economy. 10 e- 32. let me take this opportunity to thank the un secretary- general for establishing the high-level panel on digital cooperation and appointing honorable bogolo kenewendo, our minister of investment, trade and industry, as a member of this panel. we are confident that it will help devise ways on how new digital technologies can be used to deliver on our development goals. madam president, 33. we note that the implementation of the ambitious 2030 agenda for sustainable development faces immense resource and capacity constraints. in this respect, we welcome the efforts of the united nations to address these challenges through the adoption of general assembly resolution 72/279 on repositioning of the united nations development system in may this year. 34. this resolution is vital in that it aims to support countries in their efforts to implement the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. it is our firm conviction that strengthened united nations country teams and coordinator systems will contribute reinvigorated resident significantly achievement of sustainable development goals. u to the 35. equally, botswana welcomes the signing of the african unionunited nations framework for the implementation of agenda 2063 and the agenda 2030, to ensure effective coordination, execution, monitoring and reporting on these two development agendas. 36. this coordination will hopefully ensure that there is no duplication of efforts, thus allowing for the effective use of our already limited resources. madam president, 37. in order to demonstrate our abiding faith to sustainable development goal no. 17 on partnerships for the goals, my government has developed the south-south and triangular cooperation strategy. i therefore wish to express our profound gratitude to the united nations for its assistance contribution to the development of this strategy. iz and human rights madam president, 38. botswana remains committed to the promotion and protection of human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law, which are critical to sustainable development, prosperity, peace and security. 39. in this connection, we continue to support efforts to fight impunity and the principle of responsibility to protect populations from atrocities, such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. in this regard, we reaffirm our full support of the united nations human rights council and the international criminal court. 40. this year, the international criminal court achieved a milestone when it commemorated the 20'*^ anniversary of the adoption of the rome statute that founded this court. since its formation contributed in 2002, the international criminal significantly to the court has strengthening of the international criminal justice system through prosecution of grave international crimes. 41. we are also pleased to note that this year marks the 70""^ anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights and the 20'*^ anniversary of the united nations declaration on human rights defenders. these two declarations stress the importance of protecting and defending human rights. 42. in this respect, it is disheartening to note that approximately 1, 019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists were killed in 61 countries since 2015. 43. we warmly welcome the appointment of her excellency dr. michelle bachelet, the former president of chile, as the united nations high commissioner for human rights. her appointment is yet another testament of the secretary- general's commitment to gender parity in senior leadership positions. 44. i pledge my country's full support and commit to cooperate with her office. i also thank her predecessor, h.e. zeid ra'ad al hussein, for his tireless and courageous leadership in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide. jjl international peace and security madam president, 45. botswana remains deeply concerned about the protracted conflicts in afghanistan, mali, south sudan, syria and yemen. it is estimated that over the past decade, violent conflicts have led to forced displacement of over 68.5 million people. studies show that conflicts contribute to the rise in slums, hunger and food insecurity, thereby worsening any humanitarian crises. 46. we therefore urge all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligation to protect civilians and humanitarian personnel in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law. we also wish to stress that dialog and resolution of conflicts are critical to the peaceful maintenance international peace and security. 47. botswana welcomes and applauds the efforts made by the united nations to deal with threats to international peace and security, particularly terrorism, violent extremism, transnational organized crime and proliferation of small arms and light weapons. is. 48. we also commend the secretary-general for initiating reforms in the peace and security pillar aimed at strengthening the united nations capacities in conflict prevention and resolution, mediation, peacemaking, peacekeeping, post-conflict reconstruction and development, peacebuilding and sustaining peace. 49. to bolster international peacemaking efforts, african leaders have committed themselves to fund 25% of peace support operations in africa by 2021 and silencing the guns by 2020. 50. i therefore wish to applaud member states of the economic community of central african states (eccas) and the economic community of west african states (ecowas) for adopting the lome declaration on peace, security, stability, and the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, in july this year. we firmly believe that this declaration will go a long way in addressing peace and security challenges in the central and west african regions, particularly terrorist threats in the lake chad basin and the sahel-saharan region. madam president, 51. botswana further welcomes the signing of the joint declaration of peace and friendship by prime minister abiy ahmed of — l6 ethiopia and president isaias afwerki of eritrea in juiy this year, aimed at normaiising relations between these two neighboring countries. it is our hope that this declaration will herald peace, stability and security in the horn of africa. it was indeed a momentous occasion when direct flights between the two nations' capitals were launched. madam president, 52. i am pleased to inform that botswana has adopted a broad and holistic approach to amend all relevant legislation such as counter-terrorism act, financial intelligence act and arms and communications act with a view to strengthening measures aimed at countering and combating international terrorism, as well as combating money laundering. international migration madam president, 53. migration is critical to inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development. sustainable development goal 10, target 10.7 of the 2030 agenda calls on united nations member states to ""facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through 17 the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies."" 54. in this respect, my delegation welcomes the successful conclusion of the intergovernmental negotiations on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration in july this year. botswana negotiated supports agreement this that first, inter-governmentally provides a holistic and comprehensive approach to manage international migration. we look forward to its adoption in marrakesh, morocco this year. corruption madam president, 55. as the global community we need to address the problems of illicit financial flows, money-laundering and corruption, which are hemorrhaging the resources needed to implement the sustainable development goals. 56. sustainable development goal 16 calls for, among others, substantial reduction of corruption and bribery in all their forms, strengthening the recovery and return of stolen assets ia. and developing effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels. 57. in accordance with this global commitment, african leaders in january of this year, declared 2018 as the year for combating corruption, with the theme ""winning the fight against corruption: a sustainable path to africa's transformation."" this was an opportune theme to mark the 15""^ anniversary of the adoption of the united nations convention against corruption. most importantly it was an opportunity for a renewed commitment in the fight against corruption. 58. botswana continues to intensify efforts to prevent and combat corruption through its directorate on corruption and economic crime (dcec). in order to strengthen the anti-corruption legislation, my government is at an advanced stage of finalizing the draft declaration of assets and liabilities bill, which we believe will emhance integrity, transparency and accountability in government. this bill will complement the whistle blowing act and the proceeds and instruments of crime act. jil conclusion madam president, 59. in conclusion, i wish to reaffirm botswana's commitment to the purposes and principles of the united nations charter and to the full implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. 60. let us not falter, but move forward towards attaining sustainable development. we should not allow whatever challenges that cross our path to deter us, as we know, rome was not built in a day. 61. our actions should be bold and transformative as we build a better future our nations succeeding generations. we should stand firm towards our mantra of ""leaving no one behind"". let us not be hesitant in demonstrating global leadership, collective responsibility and collaborative involving all countries and peoples of the world. 62. the future is in our hands i thank you for your kind attention. ♦♦♦ 3|e}ic:|c _z£l partnerships","mokgweetsi eric keabetswe masisi, president of botswana, said the theme of the general debate — “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” — should inspire member states to fulfill the principles of the united nations charter and the goals set out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. much remains to be done to achieve prosperity for all, as 783 million people are living in extreme poverty, 2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation and 4 billion have no social protection. “it is therefore apparent that none of us, whether big or small, can overcome these gigantic development challenges alone,” he said, calling for strengthened multilateralism as well as support for individual states that face their own unique challenges. while botswana is classified as an upper middle-income country, it faces the same development challenges as less developed nations, he pointed out, appealing for ongoing support in the areas of human capital, infrastructure and capacity development for the private sector, and technology transfer. reaffirming botswana’s commitment to the 2030 agenda and noting its alignment with agenda 2063 of the african union, as well as the southern african development community (sadc) integration agenda, he said there remains a long way to go to eliminate extreme poverty, given than 35 per cent of africa’s population — 395 million people — still live in abject poverty. he outlined botswana’s efforts to improve the well‑being of its people through its national vision 2036 policy, which gives priority to economic diversification, sustainable growth, job creation and investment in human capital. he welcomed reforms to the united nations development system, stating that stronger united nations country teams and a reinvigorated resident coordinator system will help achieve the sustainable development goals. effective coordination between the united nations and the african union should avert a duplication of development efforts, thus enabling effective use of limited resources. expressing full support for the human rights council and the international criminal court, he noted that 1,019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists have been killed in 61 countries since 2015. he also voiced deep concern regarding the protracted conflicts in afghanistan, mali, south sudan, syria and yemen, and urged all parties to protect civilians and humanitarian personnel. welcoming the joint declaration of peace and friendship by the presidents of ethiopia and eritrea, he added that he looked forward to the adoption in morocco later this year of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. “as a global community, we need to address the problems of illicit financial flows, money-laundering and corruption, which are hemorrhaging resources needed to implement the sustainable development goals,” he said. recalling that goal 16 calls for a substantial reduction of corruption and bribery, alongside the recovery and return of stolen assets, he said the declaration by african leaders of 2018 as the year for combatting corruption marked an opportunity for a renewed commitment to combat corruption. for its part, botswana is finalizing legislation to strengthen government integrity, transparency and accountability."
Brazil,"73rd session of the united nations general assembly general debate statement by h.e. mr. michel temer, president of the federative republic of brazil 25 september 2018 () 0 madam president of this general assembly, maría fernanda espinosa, secretary-general of the united nations, mr, antónio guterres, ladies and gentlemen heads of state, government and delegation, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor for brazil to open this general debate. i am pleased to congratulate the president of the general assembly, maría fernanda espinosa – the first latin american woman to hold this high office. allow me to reiterate to you my wishes of every success. be certain that you can count on brazil. it is also a particular satisfaction to congratulate the secretary-general antónio guterres in our common language. ladies and gentlemen, how many speakers have already come to this podium to call for the improvement of the international order that we have been building for decades? there have been many of these speakers. i include myself among them. and i believe we were right. we are still right the words we spoke remain current. but if we want to improve our collective order, today we have an additional task: to defend the very integrity of this order. however imperfect, this order has been serving to the greater causes of humanity. there are numerous challenges to the integrity of the international order. we live in times clouded by isolationist forces. old intolerances are re-emerging. unilateral relapses are less and less the exception. but these challenges should not – and cannot – intimidate us. isolationism, intolerance, unilateralism: we have to respond to each of these tendencies with the best of ourselves. *** brazil has been responding to the first of these tendencies - isolationism - with more openness and more integration. brazil knows that our common development depends on more international flows of trade and of investment. that it depends on increased contact with new ideas and with new technologies. we will build an effectively shared prosperity by opening ourselves to the others, rather than through introspection and isolation. this is how brazil has been acting. we implement a universalist foreign policy. we have deepened the integration mechanisms in our geographic neighborhood. with mercosur, we have reaffirmed the group’s democratic calling, brought trade barriers down and signed new agreements. we have been pushing for strengthened ties with the countries forming the pacific alliance, seeking an even more united latin america – as determined by our constitution. we have also revitalized or initiated trade negotiations with partners in all regions – the 1 european union, the european free trade association, canada, the republic of korea, singapore, lebanon, morocco, tunisia. through these and other initiatives, we continue to strengthen our relationships with the americas as a whole, with europe, with asia and with africa. our participation in cooperation fora such as the g20, brics, and the community of portuguese-speaking countries has been especially productive. in these fora, we produce concrete results, with direct impact in the daily life of our societies. it is with openness and integration that we approach a better future for all. isolation may provide a false sense of security. protectionism may sound seductive. but it is with openness and integration that we achieve harmony, growth and progress. *** ladies and gentlemen, turning to the challenge posed by intolerance, brazil has also responded decisively to it with dialog and solidarity. dialog and solidarity inspire us, at every moment, to honor the universal declaration of human rights. the implementation of this document, which will soon reach its seventh decade, is an imperative that requires permanent attention and action. in the name of human rights, much has already been done by governments, institutions and individuals of the stature of sergio vieira de mello, a brazilian national whose memory i want to pay tribute to as we remember the fifteenth anniversary of his tragic death. it must be nonetheless acknowledged that violations to the international norms protecting the individuals in their dignity persist in all parts of the world. in latin america, brazil has been working to uphold democracy and human rights. together with so many other countries, we will continue to do so, alongside brotherly peoples that have suffered so much. dialog and solidarity are also in the foundation of the recently agreed-upon global compact for migration. there are over 250 million migrants in the world. these are men, women and children who, threatened by protracted crises, are faced with the hard and risky choice of leaving their homelands. it is our duty to protect them, and this is the very purpose of the global compact for migration. it now falls upon us to bring the negotiations of the global compact for refugees to a successful end. in south america, a migratory wave of great proportions is underway. an estimated one million venezuelans have left their country searching for more dignified living conditions. brazil has welcomed all those who arrive in our territory. we have sought to provide all possible assistance to dozens of thousands of migrants. in cooperation with the united nations high commissioner for refugees, we have built shelters to protect them as best as we can. we have sought to relocate them throughout the country. we have issued documents that enable them to work in brazil. we have offered school for the children, vaccination and health services for all. but we know that the solution for this crisis will only come about when venezuela reenters the path of development. brazil has a proud tradition of welcoming foreigners. as a people, we have been forged through diversity. there is a piece of the world in every brazilian. 2 faithful to this tradition, last year we passed a new migration law – a modern piece of legislation that not only protects the immigrant’s dignity but also acknowledges the benefits of immigration. we have ensured additional rights and cut bureaucracy for the entry and residence in brazil. dialog and solidarity are antidotes to intolerance, as well the bases for a lasting peace. this has been the cornerstone of the brazilian position regarding the various crises in the middle east. as it joins the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the creation of israel, brazil renews its support of the two-state solution – israel and palestine –, with both sides living side by side in peace and security. we likewise support international efforts to bring the conflict in syria to a long overdue end. we have contributed to relieving such suffering. in 2017 alone, brazil donated around one ton of medicines and vaccines in benefit of the children affected by the conflict. we have also welcomed a considerable number of refugees. in the korean peninsula, the cornerstones of our position are also dialog and solidarity. we reiterate the call for diplomatic solutions leading to denuclearization and peace. dialog and solidarity, i repeat, are the way to overcome intolerance and build peace. as put by nelson mandela, whose centenary we commemorate this year – it is our duty to strive towards ""a world of tolerance and respect for difference"", and show an unwavering ""commitment to peaceful solutions of conflicts and disputes"". *** lastly, the challenge of unilateralism, to which we reply with more diplomacy and more multilateralism. we do so firmly convinced that collective problems demand collectively-articulated solutions. this is highest meaning of the un: this is by definition a house of mutual understanding. we must strengthen this organization. we must make it more legitimate and effective. we need important reforms – among them that of the security council, whose current structure reflects a world that no longer exists. we must reinvigorate the values of diplomacy and multilateralism. we have repeatedly shown what we are capable of together when we guide our actions by these values. this is how we took a historical step, last year, as we concluded the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. i had the honor of being the first head of state to sign it. this is also how throughout decades we built a robust multilateral trade system, with ever more encompassing rules and with a credible and effective dispute settlement mechanism. these are shared historical achievements, which we must honor and broaden, eliminating the many distortions in agricultural trade affecting above all developing countries. diplomacy and multilateralism provide us with effective solutions well beyond disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and international trade. this holds true in many other areas, such as sustainable development, which is crucial for the future of mankind. in the last years alone, we have adopted agenda 2030 and the paris agreement. these are true milestones, which put us in the path of economic development with social justice and respect for the environment. brazil’s early commitment to sustainable development remains unwavering. there is no shortage of examples. we are fully committed to the change towards a low-carbon international economy. over 40% of the brazilian energy matrix is clean and renewable - one of the most sustainable in the world. 3 we have placed great effort into reducing deforestation. long-term trends are promising. today, in the brazilian amazon, deforestation rates are 75% lower than in 2004. we have created and expanded conservation units in brazil, which currently correspond to more than four times the territory of norway. the protection of the oceans is another cause that is dear to us. on the occasion of the world water forum, which we hosted in brasilia, we have established protected areas in brazilian waters that amount to the size of the german and french territories combined. in two years, we have doubled the protected areas in brazil. diplomacy and multilateralism are also decisive instruments for global security – as demonstrated by un peacekeeping missions, in which brazil is proud to play a major role. and let us not have any illusions, they are also decisive instruments to defeat terrorism and to fight transnational crimes. trafficking in persons, arms trafficking, drug trafficking, money laundering, sexual exploitation, these are all crimes that do not know borders. these are scourges that corrode our societies and are only effectively tackled through concerted policies and actions. this is what we have done in our region. we hosted in brasília the first southern cone ministerial meeting on border security. since then, we have stepped up cooperation with our neighbors in combating transnational crime. we must remain united for the collective task of building a world where peace, development and human rights prevail. we will achieve nothing alone. we will achieve nothing without diplomacy, without multilateralism. *** ladies and gentlemen, madam president, mr. secretary general, this is the last occasion on which i have the privilege of representing my country in this general debate as the president of the republic. in two weeks, the brazilian people will go to the polls. they will choose the political leadership who will govern brazil from january 2019 onwards, both in the executive and legislative branches. this is what is determined by our constitution; this is what has been done for almost thirty years and this is how it must be. because power comes from the people. because alternation in power is the very essence of democracy. and ours, ladies and gentlemen, is a vibrant democracy, backed by solid institutions. as i hand over the presidency to my successor, i will have the peace of mind of having fulfilled my duties. today, in brazil, it is possible to look back and realize how much we have accomplished in such a short time of administration. we rejected populism and we overcame the worst recession in our history – a recession with severe consequences for society, especially for the poorest. we placed managed public finances in a responsible manner and restored economic credibility. we are growing and creating jobs again. previously threatened by the lack of control in spending, public programs have been rescued and expanded. we brought brazil back to the track of development. 4 the country that i will hand over to whomever the brazilian people elects is better than the one i received. much remains to be done, but we are back on track. it is time to move ahead. the incoming government and the incoming parliament will find solid bases upon which a more prosperous and fair country can continue to be built. ladies and gentlemen, the members of the general assembly know that they have, and will always have, in brazil, a firm ally for cooperation among nations. a country that, when faced with isolationism, responds with more openness and integration. when faced with intolerance, responds with increased dialog and solidarity. and, in the face of unilateralism, responds with more diplomacy and multilateralism. in the words of the late kofi annan: “our mission is to confront ignorance with knowledge, bigotry with tolerance, and isolation with the outstretched hand of generosity”. thank you very much. 5","michel temer, president of brazil, said “we live in times clouded by isolationist forces”. old intolerances are being rekindled and unilateral relapses are increasingly less of an exception. stressing that such challenges must not intimidate the international community, he urged that isolationism, intolerance and unilateralism be responded to with the very best of the world’s peoples. noting that his country has been responding to isolationism with more openness and more integration, he stressed that shared development depends on more international trade and investment flows, more contact with new ideas and new technologies. by remaining open to others, nations will build a shared prosperity. brazil has carried out a universalist foreign policy, he continued. it has deepened the integration mechanisms in its geographic neighborhood. his government is strengthening as well as starting trade negotiations with partners from all regions. in that regard, brazil has focused on its ties with the countries forming the pacific alliance and is seeking an even more united latin america, as is enshrined in its constitution. isolation may give a false sense of security, he went on to say. protectionism may even sound seductive, but it is through openness and integration that harmony, growth and progress can be achieved. brazil has also responded in a resolute manner to the challenge of intolerance through dialog and solidarity. those values honor the universal declaration of human rights, a document that will soon celebrate seven decades. making it a reality remains an imperative that requires permanent attention and efforts. migrants are being threatened by a lingering crisis and have had to make a risky decision to leave their homelands, he said. there was a duty to protect them through the global compact for migration. one million venezuelan nationals have left their country of origin in search of better living conditions. brazil has welcomed thousands and, along with the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), has built shelters to help accommodate them. brazil has also issued formal documents so that they can work in brazil and receive schooling and healthcare. the solution to the migration crisis will be forthcoming when venezuela again finds the path to development, he said, adding that brazil is proud of its tradition of hospitality. brazil is a country so diverse that there is a piece of the world in every brazilian national, he went on to say. as dialog and solidarity are antidotes that help fight bigotry, they are also the cornerstone of long‑lasting peace. in the middle east, his country joined the ongoing celebrations of the seventieth anniversary of israel and renewed its commitment to the two-state solution. it has also supported international efforts to put an end to the conflict in syria, a conflict that has been going on for too long. in 2017 alone, brazil donated nearly one metric ton of medicines and vaccines to assist the children affected by the conflict in syria and welcomed a number of refugees. in the korean peninsula, a sense of dialog and solidarity has informed the position of brazil on denuclearization."
Brunei Darussalam,"permanent mission of brunei darussalam to the united nations 771 united nations plaza, new york, ny 10017 address by the honorable dato erywan pehin yusof, minister of foreign affairs ii of brunei darussalam at the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly 29 september 2018 new york [] madam president, mr. secretary-general, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great honor and privilege to be here today and to convey the warm greetings of his majesty the sultan and yang di-pertuan of brunei darussalam. my congratulations to her excellency maria fernanda espinosa games and the people of ecuador, on assuming the presidency of this seventy-third session. y appreciation also to secretary-general antonio guterres on his hard work in serving the international community. i would also like to take this opportunity to join others in expressing our condolences to the family of the late secretary-general kofi atta annan, whose remarkable service to this organization and many valuable contributions to advancing global peace, humanity and development serve as an inspiration to us all. amidst reports on the devastating impact of the earthquake and tsunami in sulawesi, i would also like to express our sympathies and condolences to the government and people of indonesia. excellencies, we are currently living in a world with ever increasing geo-political and geo-economic uncertainty. the foundations and principles of the international order that usually guides our expectations are in some cases being questioned, whilst in others being ignored. for a small country like brunei darussalam, such unpredictability can be very daunting and runs counter to regional and international efforts in building peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. in order for us to achieve our goals of maintaining peace, promoting prosperity and sustainable development, we greatly depend upon the consistency and stability underpinned by our adherence to international obligations and the rule of law. it is crucial that we all commit to an effective multilateralism that addresses global challenges, ranging from conflict prevention, economic uncertainty to environmental degradation. i in doing so, we have to work together in ensuring the relevance of the un to all, and everybody needs to play their part in honoring the international frameworks and agreements that we have worked so hard to achieve. one such agreement is the 2030 agenda for sustainable development which helps realize our vision of improving people s lives, without leaving anyone behind. we are fully committed to attaining the goals under the agenda, which we hope will safeguard the welfare of our citizens for generations to come. in all our efforts to achieve the sdgs, it is imperative to understand and respect the right of each country to choose its own developmental path, including adopting legislations that are suitable to its own national circumstances. excellencies, a challenge for any developing countries in pursuing sustained economic development is in addressing the uneven growth prospects amid many risks including volatility in energy prices. brunei darussalam is no exception. to address this, we are concentrating on diversifying our economy. underlying these efforts are our commitment to free trade and the rules-based multilateral trading system, and its benefits by all is critical, especially during these times of increasing trade tensions. our stand on this is evident through our participation in various platforms such as the wto and asean that support efforts to facilitate trade and investment. our involvement in various bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements is also testament to this. such agreements provide us with greater certainty in market access and strengthened trade links with our partners within and outside the region. they are particularly beneficial to small developing countries because they also spur other forms of cooperation, including human resources development and technical assistance. all of these are vital as we prepare ourselves to take advantage of potential opportunities brought about by the fourth industrial revolution. that being said, we also need to remain mindful that efforts in increasing economic growth should be aligned with our shared responsibilities in ensuring a safe and healthy environment for our future. as climate change poses a serious threat, the paris agreement remains our greatest hope in addressing this global challenge together. 2 excellencies, our progress in meeting the economic and environmental goals under the 2030 agenda is determined by our ability to maintain durable peace and stability. the work of the united nations in preventive diplomacy, mediation and peacekeeping are key to the prevention and resolution of conflict and violence. in this regard, we appreciate the secretary-general s efforts in strengthening peacekeeping operations through his action for peacekeeping initiative. this will enhance the global support for peacekeeping missions, with the view to contributing towards sustainable peace. we truly value the selfless work and sacrifice that our peacekeepers make in securing a better world. therefore, we are also pleased to join others in endorsing the declaration of shared commitments on un peacekeeping operations. this underscores our collective investment in the success and performance of our peacekeepers. lastly, in building a more peaceful, equitable and sustainable world, it is important that the un continues to promote the rule of law. on this note, we are particularly concerned with the unresolved question of palestine. for more than half a century, palestinians are denied peace, justice and freedom. in solidarity with the palestinian people, we strongly condemn actions and measures that blatantly violate their rights and dignity. these violations are against international law, including the un charter. like many countries, we have been alarmed by the developments in jerusalem, and the continued violence in the occupied palestinian territory. we remain firm in supporting the call to protect the palestinian population, as well as the creation of a fully independent palestinian state, with east jerusalem as its capital. it is brunei darussalam s greatest hope for palestine that all member states of the un and other organizations would work together to realize the vision of a two-state solution, in full conformity with international law, the un charter and all relevant un resolutions. we are also encouraged by the state of palestine’s assumption of the chairmanship of the group of 77 next year, which is a significant milestone not only for its own history but for the group as a whole. 3 excellencies, our unwavering commitment to international norms and multilateral partnerships is central to advancing our mutual aspirations of living together in peace and harmony. a significant part of this commitment is our continued support to the united nations. for more than 70 years, the un has been the epicenter of our rules-based multilateral system, where its work, from advocating values of mutual respect to promoting development, has made an impact on people all over the globe. and in spite of this, it still faces its fair share of criticism. the united nations may not be perfect, but it is the best hope that we have to achieve a future that we want togethe . as the late kofi annan once said, we need to keep hope alive and strive to do better . on our part, brunei darussalam will continue to be a reliable partner and a friend to all for the betterment of the united nations and the world at large. thank you. ***** 4","erywan pehin yusof, minister for foreign affairs ii of brunei darussalam, noting the increasing geopolitical and geo‑economic uncertainty, said that for a small country like his, such unpredictability can be daunting. it is crucial that the international community commit to an effective multilateralism that addresses global challenges, he said, adding that sustainable development depends on the consistency and stability underpinned by adherence to international obligations and the rule of law. reaffirming his country’s commitment to the 2030 agenda, he called on all countries to adopt legislations that are suitable to their own national circumstances. many developing countries face the challenge of uneven growth prospects amidst many risks including the volatility of energy prices. brunei darussalam is no exception to this, he said, noting that the country is concentrating on diversifying its economy. underlying these efforts is a commitment to free trade and rules‑based multilateral trading system. the country’s participation in various platforms such as the world trade organization (wto) and asean exemplifies this. however, he cautioned, efforts in increasing economic growth should be aligned with shared responsibilities in ensuring a safe and healthy environment. as climate change poses a serious threat, the paris agreement remains the international community’s greatest hope in addressing it. turning to peacekeeping, he expressed appreciation for the secretary‑general’s efforts in strengthening peacekeeping operations through the action for peacekeeping initiative. this will enhance the global support for missions, he said, applauding the selfless work and sacrifice of peacekeepers. regarding “the unresolved question of palestine”, he expressed solidarity with the palestinian people and condemned all actions that blatantly violate their rights and dignity. voicing alarm about the developments in jerusalem, and the continued violence in occupied palestinian territory, he called on all member states to work together to realize the vision of a two‑state solution."
Bulgaria,"statement by the prime minister of the republic of bulgaria h.e. mr. boyko borissov at the general debate of the 73^ session of the general assembly of the united nations new york, 28 september 2018 madam chair secretary general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, i think we should well appreciate that this year's theme of the general debate is on global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. it is comprehensive and provides food for thought on the direction in which our world should develop, and with it - this international organization. global leadership is. first and foremost, a great responsibilitv. in order for us to achieve sustainability and standards of life that uphold the principle of dignity for every human being on this planet, it is absolutely crucial that we demonstrate our commitment and unity in facing the challenges of our time. i am convinced that we are all aware we need to act with determination and unity in sharing the responsibility to ensure peace, equality and sustainability of our communities. the republic of bulgaria has continuously and actively worked for sustaining a world order, based on rule of law and for reaffirming the principles of multilateral cooperation. and that is whv i would like to highlight that it is the destiny of the united nations to plav a central role in this, and we activelv support this organization in its efforts. the main global challenges such as conflict resolution and peace-keeping, strengthening global security and stability, countering climate change, terrorism and ever-deepening inequality, cannot be addressed bv one single country alone. thev require shared responsibility and everyone's contribution. global peace and security depend on the stability and sustainable development of the different parts of our globalized world. every country - large or small - has the responsibility and the capacity to make a significant contribution towards security and prosperity in the region where it is located. for example, this past monday, at the high-level event on the global drug problem, organized by president trump, every participating country made a firm commitment to fight this global scourge. it was not by chance that bulgaria was one of the co-hosts of this event. we have already pledged our commitment and have proven through our actions the commitment to fighting against this problem. my country can well serve as a positive example. in order to achieve peace, security and stability, as well as the sustainable development goals, we all need to take more of these actions. the united nations plays an integral part in promotingthe fair use ofglobal opportunities to the benefitof all. inclusive and sustainableglobal growth underpins the implementation of the 2030 agenda. achieving the universal-in-nature, and closely interlinked. sustainable development goals is the key to addressing the current global challenges. the bulgarian presidency of the council of the european union, in the first half of this vear. invested considerable efforts to achieve marked progress and consensus among member-states along the main goals of the agenda. we are proud that, within our 6-month presidency tenure, the european union adopted the mandate to start negotiations for the signing of a new partnership agreement with 79 countries from africa, the caribbean and the pacific. the negotiations aim to achieve an up-to-date and dynamic partnership with these countries as an important instrument in tackling global challenges ranging from poverty and inequality to promoting peace and sustainable development for all. madam chair, please allow me to highlight some of the idiosyncrasies of the region where my country, bulgaria, is located. this year we mark the loo^h anniversary of the end of work war i, which serves to remind us of the importance of the balkans in the past, and how relevant they are in the present day. they have often been the source of conflicts and, to this day, the embers of some of them are still burning. in spite of all the circumstances and obstacles before them, countries of south eastern europe, and especially those from the western balkans, have managed to achieve remarkable progress on important and much debated issues, which took several decades to reach the current state of affairs. that is why we should not stall any further in offering the unequivocal political support of the international community for each state or initiative that deserves this support. compelling proof of the progress made by the western balkans is the recent signing of the agreements between sofia and skopje, and between athens and skopje. these agreements are crucial steps towards stability and security in south eastern europe, as well as towards the euro-atlantic prospects of the western balkans. the agreement between podgorica and pristina on the border demarcation that just came into force is also a significant milestone. these documents not only show, but also generate, the new spirit of relations between and among the countries of this region. 1will give vou one more example. based on the historic opportunity that the rotating presidency of the council of the eu offered us, bulgaria initiated a process that put the western balkans back on the agenda of european politics. the opportunities for cooperation and participation of countries from outside the region in the construction of the new balkan infrastructure has already started attracting interest and investments. an important and emblematic expression of this process was the leaders' summit of the member-states of the eu and the western balkan countries in our capital sofia in may this year. this was the first meeting of its kind after the thessaloniki summit in 2003. connectivity in all its dimensions was the focus of discussions, as well as the joint response of the young and relativelysmall balkan states to the common challenges we all face to security - such as irregular migration, organized crime and terrorism, hybrid threats, cyber-security and misinformation. the so-called sofia declaration that was adopted at the summit confirmed the european prospects of the region and turned them into an achievablegoal. we are aware that this is just the beginning of a new path that is both encouraging, but neither easy, nor quick. however, the stakes are high. not only for the citizens of these countries, not only for their eu neighbors and friends, but also for the global processes for economic and political strengthening and development. we cannot leave ""blank spots"" marked by, lagging development, weak economies and societies susceptibleto the present global threats. literally, in two days' time, the citizens of our south eastern neighbor will have to take a landmark decision about their future and namely, to reaffirm the compromise achieved with neighboring greece, which will clear their path towards euro-atlantic integration. this is a truly historic moment. it is now or never. and that is exactly why we need to support them in their strife for taking this new decision for their country. two of our other neighbors are facing a very difficult dilemma. we support the dialog between belgrade and pristina, we welcome their determination towards normalizing their bilateral relations with the help of eu mediation. at the same time, we deem the potential ""re-tailoring of borders"" a non-viable solution. important elections are coming up in october of this year for bosnia and herzegovina. they will be a key test of the unity of the country and its determination to progress further along the path of european integration. as you can see, the conditions in this part of europe are very dynamic and fraught with important events. they will determine the direction of development of the region for many years to come. and with that, to a large extent, the state of the eu. what we have managed to achieve so far, as a result of our work on the main priorities of bulgarian foreign policy, is part of our contribution to peace and security on the european continent and beyond. * * ♦ the generally optimistic prospects for the western balkans and the south-east european region, however, are in drastic contrast to the conflicts that surround them from three sides: in the ukraine - to the north-east; in the middle-east - to the south-east; and in libya to the south. direct consequences of the conflicts around the world are the migration flows and the rising threat of terrorism. i will broach these topics later. 1would like to draw your attention to the ongoing conflict in eastern ukraine first. over the past four and a half years, according to data from the un, the total number of victims of the conflict exceeds ten thousand people, and of the wounded - 24 thousand. special cause for concern is the deteriorating humanitarian and environmental situation in donbas. alongside these dire statistics, there is no real progress in implementing the minsk agreement, which we think is the only way to find a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict. the existing differences in terms of deployment of international peace-keeping forces in eastern ukraine under the auspices of the un have also not been overcome. we, the leaders of the member-states of this international organization share the responsibility to establish a peaceful, fair and sustainable world order that rests on the principles of the un charter. a want to call on you all to double our efforts in achieving peace and stability in the ukraine,without infringing upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. the situation in syria remains dramatic. in spite of the efforts of the international community, military activities in the country continue, leading to an increasing number of casualties among the civilian population, as well as to thousands of new emigrants. as a country that is geographically close to syria, bulgaria support efforts to prevent further escalation of the military conflict. pursuant to this, we support the continuation of political dialogueand the intrasyria negotiations with the aim of finding a permanent political solution to the syriancrisis. we support the launch of international initiatives to create conducive conditions for restarting the middle-east peace process via bilateral talks. we think that this is the way to achieve a final agreement, based on the principle of two states, coexisting in peace and stability. that is why we evaluate highly and strongly support the efforts of the un special coordinator for the middleeast peace process h.e. nickolay mladenov, aiming to improve the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip as soon as possible. in terms of libva. bulgaria supports the un action plan and the efforts of the mission of the united nations support mission in libya, whose primary task is stabilizing the country and reaching national conciliation in the context of political and institutional fragmentation. we support the agreements reached by the four key political leaders for conducting presidential and parliamentary elections. * * 9i( it is impossible to stop all conflicts, but 1 would nevertheless like to say a few words about another important issue related to peace and security in the word: we are of the opinion that the joint comprehensive action plan for the iranian nuclear program continues to be a key element of the international security architecture. we also support all efforts for the fiill, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the korean peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace in the region of north-eastern asia. madam chair, the migration flows and the refugee crises are a global phenomenon. they are consequence of a myriad of political and socio-economic factors, but most of all, of the conflicts in the various parts of the world. let me underscore - clearly and right from the start - that irregular migration is a serious challenge before our societies, with reference to security and stability. we need to strengthen cooperation with all countries of origin, transit and destination in order to reach a sustainable and permanent solution. it needs to fully guarantee human rights and also the sovereign right of states to guarantee the security of their borders. the efforts of the international communitv need to predominantiv focus on the main causes for migration - political, socio-economic and natural. we need to pay special attention to the different dimensions of development and the integral link between development and security. if we do not back these efforts with active and mediation and peace-keeping, and if we do not manage to resolve the burning conflict and the prevention of future ones, chances for success are doomed. and this is where 1 see the crucial and unique role of the united nations, which, if there is sufficient political will on the side of member-states, can and should be strengthened. during its presidency of the council of the eu, bulgaria took active part in the process of negotiating the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. the finalizing of the language of the compact is an achievement of multilateral cooperation and 1am confident that its adoption at the inter-governmental conference in morocco this year will set the ground for the successful implementation of the first global framework for cooperation in the area of international migration. we also welcome the completion of the consultations on the text of the global refugee compact, which exemplifies a comprehensive response to large-scale migration flows, based on the principle of shared responsibility. * 4c 4c recently, we have seen an increase in the number of terrorist attacks all over the world, as well as an increase in the number of innocent victims of terrorism. the irregular migration waves allow for the infiltration of our countries and communities by former fighters from syria, iraq, afghanistan and other places, including trained members of terrorist organizations such as is and al-qaida. bulgaria cateeoricallv condemns all forms and expressions of terrorism, no matter the cause for which thev have allegedly been perpetrated. they undermine peace, security, social and economic development of states. the effective response to this phenomenon requires the coordinated efforts of the entire international community. 8 that is why we support the united nations in its capacity as a universal organization which possesses the full range of instruments to lead and coordinate the process, alongside facilitating the exchange of experience among the regional organizations and the national agencies, and assists the streamlining of their efforts. we support the work of the office of the un to counter terrorism and the specific steps taken to intensify the operations of the organization along this line, including support for the organization of the high-level meeting of heads of national counter-terrorism agencies. a priority task is to take measures to protect young people from radicalizing or joining terrorist groups, as well as neutralizing the influence of persons and organizations instigating terrorist attacks. madam chair, this year we mark the 70^ anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights, and bulgaria will, for the first time, present its candidacy for membership in the un human rights council. we rely on the support of member-states. this is not an end in itself for us, but rather an expression of our consistent policy of protection and assertion of human rights in bulgaria and at the global level. our presidency of the council of the eu gave bulgaria the opportunity to showcase its contribution to various aspects of the protection of human rights. we intend to continue to share our best practices as a member of the un human rights council. the values that give meaning to any political effort subsume the past, present and future. this allows us to better comprehend and appreciate our present efforts. there is a moment in bulgaria's history which we are justly proud of. 75 years ago, in the darkest of years during world war ii, bulgaria's citizens, the church and the enlightened leaders and intellectuals stood up to the attempts to deport close to fifty thousand bulgarian jews to the death camps. and they managed to prevent it from happening. achieved at a time when nazi germany had subordinated and occupied almost all of europe. 1 am sharing the story of the salvation of the bulgarian jews because it carries a very strong message relevant to the present and all people who feel threatened. it shows that humaneness and courage can win over power and irrationality, and save lives. it reminds us that we should never cease to fight for human life and the right causes. the salvation of the bulgarian jews is an example much needed today to reassure us that values are not a forgotten category, but a chance for a better future. the bulgarian example should become known to more people so that it can give courage to others around the world who are currently fighting to defend theirs and others' lives, dignity, and human rights. it is our mission at present to not allow the return of xenophobia and antisemitism, or the irreverence for the right to live, based on race, ethnicity or other factors. we bulgarians know that it is possible and that it has happened before. to guarantee peace and prosperity around the world is our main task. i am convinced that this is attainable not through arms or battles, but with more humaneness and a greater sense of responsibility. we also need more than ever to strengthen the role and authoritativeness of the united nations in its global operations. 1am confident that with efforts and good will on the part of all member-states, this grand goal can be achieved. thank you. madam chair. 10","boyko borissov, prime minister of bulgaria, stressing the central role of the united nations in sustaining a world order based on rule of law, underscored that every country, large or small, has the responsibility to make a significant contribution towards security and prosperity in its own region. that was exemplified by his country’s commitment to fighting the global drug problem which had led it to co‑host the recent high‑level event on that topic. further, the bulgarian presidency of the council of the european union invested considerable efforts to achieve progress and consensus among member states, and during its tenure, the european union adopted the mandate to start negotiations for the signing of a new partnership agreement with 79 countries from africa, the caribbean and the pacific. highlighting some of the “idiosyncrasies” of his region, he said that the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war was a reminder of the importance of the balkans

efforts with active mediation and peacekeeping, and if we do not manage to resolve burning conflicts and prevent future ones, chances of success are doomed,” he cautioned. noting that this year marked the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights, he added that his country will be presenting its candidacy for membership in the human rights council. this is not an end in itself, he stressed, but an expression of bulgaria’s consistent policy of protection of human rights in the country and at the global level. seventy-five years ago, in the darkest years of the second world war, bulgaria’s citizens, the church, enlightened leaders and intellectuals stood up to the attempts to deport close to 50,000 bulgarian jews to the death camps. that moment, he emphasized, carries a strong message relevant to the present moment and all people who feel threatened, he said, adding that it was his country’s mission to not allow the return of xenophobia."
Burkina Faso,,"alpha barry, minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation of burkina faso, said his country was enacting efforts to strengthen democracy through measures including a new constitution. other progressive steps include abolition of the death penalty. despite a difficult security and social context, his country has a growth rate of 6.7 per cent, due to cleaning up public finance, improved tax revenue measures and growth projects launched under a national economic and social development plan. a policy of free health care for pregnant women and children under the age of 5 will be gradually extended to the entire population. he expressed deep concerned that his country is the target of terrorist attacks, formerly limited to the northern region but now reaching the south-west and east, bordering côte d’ivoire, ghana, niger, benin and togo. in three years, 229 people have been killed by terrorist groups, with his government mobilizing all resources to combat the threat. unfortunately, terrorists are now using improvised explosive devices. in the past week, they blew up two vehicles killing 14 members of defense and security forces. terrorists are also targeting civilians, students and teachers, forcing closure of 520 schools depriving 56,000 students of their right to education. however, he said the attacks have strengthened the country’s unity, solidarity and determination to defend its values. one thing is certain: no country can fight terrorism on its own. pointing to general assembly resolution 72/165, adopted in december, proclaiming 21 august the international day of remembrance and tribute to the victims of terrorism, he called for the security council to support the g-5 sahel joint force by placing it under the mandate of chapter vii of the united nations charter. noting that poverty, exclusion and climate change are root causes of conflict, his country launched the special emergency assistance program to the sahel member countries and sudan, addressing dual socioeconomic and security challenges. more than ever, the world must defend and encourage multilateralism. to that end, he noted burkina faso has 2,000 personnel involved in six peacekeeping operations. one of three countries maintaining troops in guinea-bissau, his country is also the largest troop-contributing country to the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali (minusma). turning to nations in crisis, he congratulated the government and people of mali on successful recent presidential elections despite the threat of terrorism. the peace agreement between leaders of south sudan and renewed negotiations in western sahara were also a source of hope. however, he said the israeli-palestinian conflict remains a concern and he remains convinced it can only be resolved with a two-state solution. dialog on the korean peninsula is a good sign that needs the encouragement of the international community. he also called for an end to the embargo on cuba. pointing to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons as a threat to peace and security in several regions, he also condemned the resurgent use of weapons of mass destruction. with humanitarian issues also a concern given the refugee crisis, he hailed the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, noting the conference to adopt it will take place in africa. as a country of immigration with 4 million citizens living abroad and 25,000 refugees on its soil, burkina faso will also adopt the global compact on refugees. calling for security council reform for a more inclusive body, he said it must remedy an injustice against africa, which deserves permanent membership."
Burundi,,"ezéchiel nibigira, minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation of burundi, drew attention to his country’s new constitution — which was put to a peaceful referendum on 17 may — and its president’s pledge to complete his second mandate in 2020 and support his elected successor. contrary to what others have stated about the president trying to hold power until 2034, his promise to stand down sets a praiseworthy example. at the same time, a spirit of tolerance and transparency, as well as the openness of the political space, has seen the return of both refugees and exiled political leaders to burundi as well as the release of more than 2,000 prisoners at the start of the year. he reviewed the progress being made in the ongoing inter‑burundian dialog, saying that those asking the country to promote dialog are pushing on an open door. in august, a meeting of all political parties culminated in a road map towards free, inclusive and peaceful elections in 2020. a national independent electoral commission has been set up and, this month, the former president of the united republic of tanzania and facilitator of the inter‑burundian dialog sent a team to consult with all stakeholders ahead of a fifth and final round of talks. on the security front, he emphasized that, apart from a few instances of crime, the situation in burundi is calm, stable and entirely under control — an assessment shared by the special envoy of the secretary‑general as well as the security council through its press statement of 22 august. the return to normality enabled burundi to organize the constitutional referendum as well as host several conferences and visits by eminent persons. he called on the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) to intervene with those countries putting up obstacles to the return of burundian refugees. he went on to say that burundi stands ready to work with the united nations and other nations to promote human rights based on mutually respectful cooperation. those who want to turn the human rights council into a political tool risk compromising the goals set out by member states when that council was created, he said, adding that the withdrawal of some countries should be viewed as a disavowal of the way it is being used by a minority of states. noting the participation of burundian troops in united nations peacekeeping operations, he said burundi is far from being a threat to international peace and security and called on the security council to have the courage to remove it from its agenda. burundi’s rightful place is not in the council agenda, but with those united nations agencies tasked with social and economic development, he said."
Cabo Verde,,"jorge carlos de almeida fonseca, president of cabo verde, said that hate, discrimination and violence are still alive despite the upcoming seventieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights. the integration of human rights standards and principles into the legal order of many countries marks “a major advancement of humanity”, he said. yet, as the struggle to ensure the effectiveness of the declaration intensifies, violations of human rights are virtually institutionalized in large parts of the world. while noting that such violations are observed in situations of war that afflict many parts of africa, he reaffirmed his country’s choice to pursue peace and dialog to prevent and resolve conflicts. he expressed profound regret that the death penalty still exists and urged those present today to engage in a “profound, careful and responsible reflection” on this issue. reiterating his absolute support for pope francis’ recent appeal to the conscience of government authorities, he stressed the need to seek an international consensus for the abolition of the death penalty. “we firmly believe, in the name of clemency and prudence, that capital punishment is not an appropriate and fair instrument. nor is it efficient in achieving justice,” he stated. underlining that the death penalty was abolished in cabo verde in the nineteenth century, he also called for a universal moratorium on executions, further aligning himself with pope francis. cabo verde has been characterized by political stability and can be considered an example of peaceful coexistence of people from different countries, and of various beliefs, he said. major international institutions have positively evaluated the economic, human and financial achievements of his nation, which allowed it to achieve middle‑income status. however, he added, cabo verde has to remain reliant on international solidarity due to its services‑based economy, small market and agricultural sector that struggles against desertification. as it looks to the future, cabo verde must take into consideration the increasingly disastrous impacts of climate change — and natural hazard risks — the world faces. he recalled that his country obtained middle‑income status during a major international financial crisis, and this caused it to miss the window of opportunity such progress typically creates. since then, its structural vulnerabilities have worsened and become more complex. this shows “the need for, and pertinence of, support measures that are distinct and adjusted to the reality of our country” in the spheres of development, trade and foreign debt. he called for more consequent inclusion and a greater eligibility of island developing countries, in line with the ongoing work at the united nations and the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), which he encourages. the government of cabo verde will organize a round table in paris in december to call for the creation of innovative partnerships that take into consideration its reality as a small island–developing state, he said. it will be an opportunity for his country to seek its development partners’ opinion on its proposals and discuss various forms of cooperation, in keeping with cabo verde’s own national efforts, including its national development plan, which is aligned with the sustainable development goals."

session of the united nations general assembly 28 september 2018 | new york, usa - madam president! my participation in this general assembly is in the context that cambodian nation is enjoying the dividends of peace, stability and rapid development \which had never been before in her modern history. cambodia is a successful case of a v^ar-torn country which has succeeded in making a complete and prideful transformation. previously infamous for its killing fields, an unstable region caused by armed conflicts and dangerous mine disposals, an economically backward country mired in poverty and food insecurity, cambodia now enjoys full peace, and has become a popular tourist destination in southeast asia; a food exporter; an outstanding performer in poverty reduction and improvement in social indicators. cambodia is recognized as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, which recently has successfully graduated from its status as a low-income country to a lower-middle income country, owing to its high economic grovrth at around 7% per annum over the past two decades. notably known for its armed struggle for the power and changes of government, cambodia is now governed by the rule of law and firmly respects the multi-party liberal democracy, with regular, free and fair elections, held to enable its people to choose the country's leadership. in the general election of cambodia's sixth legislature of the national assembly in july, nearly 7 million cambodians, or 83.02% of the total registered voters, cast their votes and decided on their political choices freely and without any coercion, threat or violence. twenty registered political parties have competed in the election which clearly demonstrated a legitimate representation of pluralist politics and reflected what thousands of domestic and international observers described as a stable democratic process in cambodia and as a free, fair, and credible election. by their votes, cambodians reaffirmed their desire for peace, stability and long-lasting sustainable development. indeed, the free choice of the cambodian people and the legitimate result of this election is not a subject for question or debate. some external circles, who have fed on ambition to interfere in the domestic affairs of cambodia, still fail to see the quality and integrity of our election process by issuing statements against or attacking the election outcome. such actions are a serious assault on the will of the cambodian people. page 1 of 4 - madam president! i would like to draw the attention of all un members to the vitality of the united nations charter. it depends on all of us to provide a proper respect for this crucial document by avoiding the interference, damaging, or disrupting sovereignty of an independent state. we are heartedly regretful to highlight the fact that human rights nowadays have become ""a mission to impose civilization"" for some powerful nations or, perhaps, as their operating standards as the pretext for interference under the name of political right protection. as a result, the imposition of unilateral sanctions has become a popular weapon of powerful nations in managing their international politics, which is completely driven by their geopolitical agendas. this is nothing but a use of the brutal force of a particular state to impose its will on other sovereign states. in a world, where the eras of imperialism and colonialism became the history, we have to acknowledge that not all nations in this general assembly shall follow the governing model of any country. big countries should not attempt to install their administrative system on other small countries, because those small countries also possess sovereignty and legitimate aspiration to maintain their own identities. in the modern-days of interdependence, such an old style coercive mindset should be put to rest. together, both big and small countries, must respect one another and uphold the rules of the international law and the charter of the united nations. - madam president! currently, the world is facing severe instabilities while the threats to peace are coming in many forms, more than what we have witnessed in the past 25 years. we are all living in a world faced with fragility, unpredictability and complicated changes, as challenges are coming from various fronts, including the increase in persistent conflicts and unprecedented humanitarian crises. we are deeply concerned by the tensions made by a first world class superpower in the diplomatic circle and by the conflicts happening in many places thank to the interference by this superpower. we are also deeply concerned by the rush decisions made by this superpower to urgently withdraw from major international agreements that threaten the core legitimacy of international legal order. these unilateral actions have undermined the state-to-state relationships and caused tension in the international community. yet, what puts the most pressure is a direct attack on multilateralism. undoubtedly, in our globalized world, all things are connected. if we begin to adhere to the protectionist policy, unilateralism and trade war, we are closing the door by not welcoming any trade and investment opportunities which have provided prosperity to our countries, both small and big ones, for many decades. eventually, we all are poorer; our economies will decline; financial capital will shrink and the ability to achieve the sustainable development goals (sdgs), as well as, addressing the challenges caused by climate change would be seriously affected. those factors will make poor countries suffer prolonged poverty, and thus we are more vulnerable to the dangerous ideology of terrorism, extremism, and regional conflicts. page 2 of 4 cambodia, as a small economy, believes in the interests of rule-based international cooperation. as a matter of fact, we all have been prospering because of globalization. we all are thus convinced that the global trade should not be hindered by the imposition of unilateral tariffs; yet it should be enhanced and supported through the adherence to conducive policies for trade and investment, as well as, the provision of special preferential treatments to developing countries. stability and diversification in the financial sector need to be further encouraged to promote innovation and development. all in all, we need to jointly maintain and strengthen ^'multiiateralism"". in fact, peace without development is not sustainable. in this context, ^^sustainable development goals"" of the united nations play a pivotal role in guiding toward prosperity for the peoples. cambodia views the sdgs as an important opportunity to mobilize efforts in achieving poverty reduction, as well as, sustainable and inclusive development. the royal government of cambodia (rgc) soon will approve 'xambodia sustainable development goals (csdgs)"" which has been fully localized, and we will use those goals to shape our medium and long-term policies and plans for cambodia. moreover, the conflict prevention is a precondition for a long-lasting peace. the un peacekeeping forces play a vital leading role in these efforts. as a result, cambodia greatly welcomes the vision of h.e. antonio guterres, the un secretary-general, on peace-bullding and peace-keeping, particularly further paying continued attention to the confllctlon prevention. cambodia is a consistent supporter of the architecture of peace and security of the united nations. for instance, for the last 12 years, cambodia has sent thousands of blue helmet forces to join peace-keeping missions under the umbrella of the united nations. however, peace-keeping is facing unprecedented challenges since the non-state actors have waged rebellion wars against our peace-keeping forces, which have caused many lives and disabilities. we are sincerely indebted to the sacrifice of these un peace-keeping heroes. nonetheless, their death and sacrifice have not distorted our commitment to further contributing to the cause of this great mission. another severe and complicated threat which is the barriers to the long-lasting peace is terrorism. they have disintegrated communities, worsened the conflicts and weakened the stability of the whole region. currently, the battles against terrorism have become even more complex and modernized since the terrorists are turning to the cyberspace for their malevolent operation. profoundly, the cross-border nature of terrorism requires us to build a multilateral cooperation with concerted coordination. including ^^countermeasures"" and ^^preventlve measures"". addressing climate change is another key element for the success of the 2030 agenda, which requires urgent and focused attention from the global community. the fundamentals for action on climate change are undoubtedly rested upon the paris agreement. in this spirit, cambodia will provide full support to the secretary-general of the united nations to organize the climate summit next year to foster the inspiration to further address climate change. page 3 of 4 - madam president! finally, i would like to emphasize that cambodia fully supports the un's global leadership, and commits to implementing our shared responsibility to build a peaceful and equitable human society who enjoys sustainable and inclusive development. thank you for your attention! page 4 of4","samdech akka moha sena padei techo hun sen, prime minister of cambodia, said his country was a clear example of the successful transition from war to peace, adding that the country was enjoying the dividends of stability and rapid development. previously infamous for its killing fields, cambodia is now a peaceful tourist destination and is recognized as one of the world’s fastest growing economies. the country is governed by the rule of law and respect for multiparty, liberal democratic principles. in july, nearly 7 million cambodians freely cast their vote to determine their political future. twenty political parties participated in the election which clearly demonstrated legitimate representation of pluralistic politics. the legitimate results of the election are not subject to question or debate, he said, adding that external ambitions to interfere in the electoral process are an assault on the will of cambodians. drawing attention to the vitality of the united nations charter, he said it was crucial to avoid interfering in, damaging or disrupting the sovereignty of independent states. he voiced regret that human rights have become a mission to impose specific politics and a pretext for interference by powerful nations. as a result, sanctions have become a popular weapon among certain states. big countries must not attempt to install their administrative system on small countries because those small countries also possess sovereignty and legitimate aspirations. he voiced deep concern over tensions resulting from the actions of a “first world super-power” and over that state’s brash decision to withdraw from international mechanisms, adding that such actions undermine state‑to‑state relations. in an interconnected world, reverting to protectionism effectively closes the door on trade and investment, two paths to prosperity. unilateralism will make all countries poorer and render them unable to implement the sustainable development goals, he said. with a small economy, he said that cambodia believes in the benefits of rules‑based international cooperation, adding that global trade must not be hindered through the imposition of tariffs. together, states must maintain and strengthen the principle of multilateralism. peace without development is not sustainable, he assured, adding that the sustainable development goals can guide the world towards prosperity. the goals are an important opportunity to mobilize efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive development. the cambodia sustainable development goals will soon be approved and that will guide medium‑ and long‑term policymaking. conflict prevention is also a precondition for long‑lasting peace, he said, noting that united nations peacekeeping efforts play a vital role in global peace efforts. cambodia welcomes the secretary‑general’s vision for the organization’s peacebuilding and peacekeeping initiatives and his focus on conflict prevention. terrorism represents a severe and complicated threat and a barrier to long‑lasting peace, he said. terrorist groups disintegrate communities, worsen conflict and weaken the stability of whole regions. as terrorists turn to cyberspace, counter‑terrorism efforts are forced to become more complex and go through modernization efforts. the cross‑border nature of terrorism requires states to foster concerted cooperation initiatives that include preventive measures. climate change is another threat standing in the way of implementation of the 2030 agenda. he pointed to the paris agreement as the foundation for action on climate change and asserted cambodia’s commitment to participate in climate‑related mechanisms. cambodia fully supports united nations global leadership and commits itself to implementing its shared responsibility to build a peaceful and equitable world, he stated."
Cameroon,,"lejeune mbella mbella, foreign minister of cameroon, said that persistent, hotbeds of tensions in africa and the middle east, and the emergence of new challenges such as migration and natural disasters, shake the very foundation of civilization. these issues along with the unprecedented interdependence of people requires a strong united nations. the legitimacy of the organization depends on member states and united nations reform, particularly in the security council. “we cannot afford to be marginalized,” he said. the well-being of human beings depends on the international community’s ability to unite to fight poverty and promote democracy, he said. migrants must be treated with dignity and respect. poverty, unemployment, and falling purchasing power impinge on human dignity. they shatter peace and cause human movement. the question of migratory flows should remind everyone of the importance of effective solidarity and shared prosperity. turning to collective security, he said that the settlement of internal conflicts must continue to adhere to the principles of the united nations charter. efforts on disarmament need to be intensified. more than 90 per cent of victims of war are killed by small arms and light weapons, he continued. such weapons are increasingly falling into the hands of armed groups such as boko haram. under cameroon’s leadership, the states of central africa are committed to combating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. they intend to strengthen cooperation and coordination and pool resources. on economic recovery, he said that growth is below what is needed to achieve the sustainable development goals. honoring existing commitments of official development assistance (oda) is not enough to meet the funding needs of the 2030 agenda. he underscored the need to transform the structure of many african economies. it is more vital than ever to help african countries alleviate their debt burden and move their products to global markets. he called for a universal multilateral trading system that is equitable and fair. for its part, cameroon has pursued the development of its productive sectors and the preservation of its climate. he called for a host of urgent actions to help conserve lake chad, adding: “this is a question of life or death.” the situation is deteriorating in two regions of cameroon, he said, expressing concern for the state of the economy there and calling for international support."
Canada,"statement by h. e. mr. marc-andré blanchard, at the general debate rd of the 73 session of the general assembly 1 october 2018 together, through uncharted territory canada is honored to help close this general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. let me start with a simple question. why does the un matter? the answer is also simple. the magnitude of the contemporary challenges the world is confronting, from climate change to terrorism, from economic inequality to irregular migration, from protracted crises to humanitarian emergencies, demands action. each of these challenges is systemic. none can be solved by countries acting in isolation or bilaterally. all of them require the world to work together. the un is the only place where we all come together to tackle these challenges. indeed, this un general assembly – our assembly – is the only forum where representation is global. this representation not only bestows legitimacy, it affords opportunities to harness diversity of thought and experience, of skills and knowledge, and of ideas, in support of better outcomes for all. since the beginning of the postwar project, canada has been at the heart of the un. a canadian, john peters humphrey was 1 among the drafters of the universal declaration of human rights. we were at the advent of peacekeeping. we helped to build the institutions at the core of the rules-based international order. but these rules and institutions were not, and should not be, static entities, impervious to change. notwithstanding their tremendous achievements, we should acknowledge that the benefits of these rules and institutions have not been evenly distributed. too many remain excluded, economically, socially and politically, from the decision-making that affects their lives. the “greatest generation” that came out of the ashes of the second world war was great not because times were simpler, or the challenges less complex. they were great because they found a way to work together, in common cause for collective outcomes. their work helped to ensure stability and relative peace and security for over 70 years. we owe it to them, and to us, to continue to work together to make our multilateral world order more efficient, fairer and more inclusive. that is why supporting the implementation of the current un reforms led by our secretary general, antonio guterres, is so essential. together, to make multilateralism work for everyone. agenda 2030 is a phenomenal achievement of the united nations. for the first time in history, we agreed on a comprehensive strategic plan to achieve a sustainable world. the plan brings us to uncharted territory. sticking to old approaches will not help us meet its targets. 2 we ought to find new ways of doing things, for silos to be broken between governments and civil society, between governments and the private sector, between north and south; between the traditional so called like-minded and non-traditional like-minded. we ought to do things differently at the un and in our governments to better deliver results for people on the ground. we ought to hold fresh, frank and inclusive discussions. we ought to develop a greater sense of urgency. we ought to reconsider our approach to risk. inaction is a risk for governments and people, but also for investors. we ought to identify the opportunities in our challenges. we ought to look at new partnerships to harness new opportunities. as our secretary general says: “climate change is the defining issue of our time.” a significant component of the response to climate change is new, greener and more resilient infrastructure. this represents a 26 trillion-dollar opportunity for us all. to harness this opportunity, starting with the most vulnerable, small island states, we must all work together with scientists, multilateral institutions, regional banks, investors, and civil society like never before. not building essential infrastructure is not an option. as prime minister trudeau said in this very assembly: “developing countries should not be punished for a problem they did not create, nor should they be deprived the opportunities for clean growth that developed nations are now pursuing.” and we should all support africa as it works to create opportunities for its youth and meet the ambitions of its agenda 3 2030 through greater economic integration and prosperity. doing so is key to a more secure world. greater, and more shared, prosperity leads to greater peace. bringing people together is at the heart of canada’s national identity. in canada, we have come to understand that diversity is our strength. indigenous peoples in canada are the bedrock of our diversity. they speak more than 60 different languages. their cultures are some of the richest on the continent. one in every five canadians was born outside of the country. our largest urban centers are among the most cosmopolitan on earth. over 50% of the populations of both vancouver and toronto were born outside canada. canada has become home to refugees and new canadians for decades. while we are very proud to have welcomed over 50 000 syrian refugees over the last three years, we are fully aware that many countries have also shown great leadership in welcoming many more. i must say, one of the things that makes me very proud is that 40% of the syrian refugees we have welcomed – some 20,000 people – have been directly sponsored by private citizens who choose to personally contribute. of course, our track record on promoting economic and social integration will always require work and action. while we have had important successes, we have made mistakes and still face challenges – the most important of which remains reconciliation with first nations. in canada, we understand that we need to listen and to learn in order to contribute to better outcomes. it is what we do; both at home and abroad. 4 together, to break down barriers and connect people to opportunity we are using our g7 presidency this year both to listen as well as to learn from others, but also to innovate and break down silos. for the first time, to ensure that governments were delivering in a more cohesive manner, canada convened ministers of finance and ministers of international development together to explore new ways of financing development. we can’t afford anymore to have discussions at the un that are distinct from those at the world bank or the imf. we also felt very strongly that the g7 needed to tackle the issue of climate resilience and disaster recovery. while canada has its own extensive coast lines and borders on three oceans, we invited small island, coastal african, and southeast asian states to this critical conversation. building on the un oceans conference, this discussion produced a charter seeking to ban the use of plastics in our oceans, and is paving the way to the sustainable blue economy conference in nairobi this year that canada is proud to be co-hosting with kenya. we partnered with the world bank and others to raise close to $3.8 billion to reduce the barriers that women and girls face in accessing education in conflict and fragile states. their inclusion will lead to exceptional benefits for their communities, and by extension, for the world. we also need capital that flows faster and at scale in emerging and frontier markets. for this reason, we are also working together with partners from across the united nations and the private sector to unlock the capital that will connect people to opportunities. 5 as a direct result of the work we do here at the un, just a few days ago at the high-level meeting on financing the sdgs, prime minister trudeau announced the establishment of a toronto affiliate of the global infrastructure hub to do precisely that: leverage canadian expertise in infrastructure to help connect capital to projects. these projects fuel long-term economic growth and support the transition to a low-carbon economy while making progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals and improving the representation of women and marginalized groups in sustainable infrastructure. together, for enduring peace and security our commitment to multilateralism – notably un peacekeeping – includes a commitment to renewal and reform, a commitment to make the system our grandparents built fit for purpose in the 21st century. canada is proud to have increased its contribution to un peacekeeping operations and to have adopted smart pledging – sending the people and equipment that are most needed to the places where they are most useful. canada is spearheading the elsie initiative – a practical plan to act on our shared promise to double the number of women in peacekeeping operations. we set that as a goal, first and foremost, because of our shared belief in the fundamental equal rights of women. we also know that having women in the ranks – and in charge – makes peacekeeping more effective and its results more durable. we look forward to working with our new partners, ghana and zambia, to better recruit train, retain and promote women across all of our police and military forces. 6 for the international rules-based order to work for all, the rules need to apply to all. accountability cannot be a luxury afforded only when circumstances allow. as is the case everywhere, canada’s actions in myanmar, syria, ukraine and venezuela are guided by an unequivocal commitment to protecting and promoting human rights. the crimes against humanity committed against the rohingya of myanmar, including the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war, are utterly unacceptable. canada’s parliament unanimously adopted a motion naming these crimes as genocide and urging the security council to refer these appalling acts to the icc. the plight of the rohingya people demands a response. canada is appalled by crimes the assad regime in syria has committed against its own people, including most horrifically the use of banned chemical weapons. syrians rightly demand accountability and hope for an enduring political solution. the white helmets, many of whom gathered evidence of chemical weapon attacks at risk of death, rightly expect our support in seeking justice. in canada’s own hemisphere, an oas panel of independent international experts carefully documented many of the crimes being committed by the maduro regime against its own people. here too, venezuelans hope for accountability. for this reason, we and our regional partners took the exceptional step of referring this case to the icc. the ongoing illegal annexation and occupation of crimea is a clear breach of international law. respect for state sovereignty 7 and territorial integrity are not mere notions; they are the foundations of the un charter. russia’s destabilizing actions cannot be allowed to stand. our determination to ensure accountability in myanmar, syria, ukraine and venezuela is accompanied by a deep commitment to improve the humanitarian situation for the millions affected, both within those countries as well as across those regions. we recognize that the disproportionate share of the responsibility for providing lifesaving support to so many has fallen on neighboring countries, and pledge to continue our support for them as well. and we will continue to contribute to the work of the united nations in addressing these challenges. canada's candidacy for the united nations security council (2021-22) when the international rules-based order was designed, this assembly mandated the security council to authorize the use of force, to keep the peace, and to keep us safe. seventy years later, that remains its core responsibility. the security council’s agenda is replete with persistent and emerging challenges. some security threats we know all too well; others are emerging, and others still we have yet to anticipate. but all are systemic and require collective responses. be they old or new, these threats will continue to test the security council's ability to adapt and respond. that is why canada is seeking a non-permanent seat on the security council in 2021-2022. we are confident that we can contribute to effective, carefully considered global responses 8 we have a proven record of working with other member states to bring fresh ideas and innovative approaches to tackle complex problems, from peacekeeping and policing to peacebuilding and transitions. we are confident that we can harness the diversity of ideas and experience necessary to fashion forward-looking approaches that can work. after all, bringing people together is our calling card. a capacity for cooperation defines our national character. inclusion is part of our identity. when canada has served on the un security council, we have done so inclusively. we brought other states and civil society into the conversation. we championed the women, peace and security agenda and human security. we fought for the protection of civilians caught in the crossfire of armed conflict. if elected to the security council, we will bring to bear our longstanding dedication to peacekeeping, our over thirty years of service as chair of the un’s special committee on peacekeeping operations, and our active membership on the peacebuilding commission. if elected, we will work with others to tackle climate change and violent extremism, and to promote economic security and the empowerment of women and girls. we will champion inclusion and accountability, openness and transparency, in all of the un security council’s deliberations. we will help to find solutions to build a safer, fairer, and more secure world, where the benefits of the international rules-based order are distributed more evenly. 9 we are confident that the institutions we have spent more than seven decades building can be renewed and revitalized. but we can only do this effectively, if we do it together. thank you. merci. 10","marc-andré blanchard (canada) said the world’s many challenges are systemic and cannot be solved by countries acting in isolation or bilaterally. all of them require the world to work together and the united nations is the only place where they can do so. emphasizing that canada has been at the heart of the organization since its inception, he said the institutions at the core of the rule‑based organization were never meant to be static entities, impervious to change. member states owe it to the generation that emerged from the second world war to make multilateralism more efficient, fairer and more inclusive, he said, adding that the secretary‑general’s reforms are essential in that regard. the 2030 agenda is a phenomenal achievement, but it takes the international community into uncharted territory for which new ways of doing things must be found, he said, calling for fresh, frank and inclusive discussions; a greater sense of urgency; and a new approach to risk. quoting his prime minister, he said developing countries should not be punished for climate change, nor should they be deprived of the opportunities for clean growth. greater economic integration and prosperity in africa is key for a more secure world. he drew attention to canada’s ethnic diversity, its welcoming of syrian refugees and the challenge of reconciliation with its first nations. stressing the need to break down barriers and connect people with opportunities, he said the international community can no longer afford to have discussions at the united nations distinct from those at the world bank and the international monetary fund (imf). he noted canada’s increased contribution to united nations peacekeeping operations and its spearheading role in the elsie initiative to double the number of women in peacekeeping operations. citing the situations in myanmar, syria, ukraine and venezuela, he reiterated canada’s commitment to human rights. he went on to discuss his nation’s candidacy for a non‑permanent seat on the security council in 2021‑2022, stating that, if elected, his country will harness the diversity of ideas and experience needed to fashion workable and forward‑looking approaches."
Central African Republic,,"faustin archange touadera, president of the central african republic, said that at a time when the united nations is undergoing broad reforms and the world is facing ever more complex challenges, from violent extremism to economic inequalities, the organization has a central role to play in maintaining peace and security worldwide. global leadership must provide the necessary tools for an efficient response. supporting the african union’s position, he said the continent must be fully represented in all united nations organs, particularly the security council, which should eliminate veto power for its permanent members and allocate a permanent seat to an african nation. on the global threats of terrorism and violent extremism, he said his country and region have not escaped some of the consequences, including the unraveling of social cohesion, rampant violence, humanitarian crises and the destruction of development efforts. africa has showed its unity in combating those scourges, working together in a holistic, coherent manner that contributes to development. that is the best way to prevent and combat those threats, he said, emphasizing the significance of tailored responses adapted to unique environments. turning to challenges ahead, he said that when migration is managed well, the phenomenon can have positive development effects for nations of origin and significant gains for countries of destination. managed poorly, migration also has grave consequences for the well-being of countries and migrants, coupled with risks of destabilizing national and regional security, he said, commending the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to adopt the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. on climate change challenges, he encouraged all states to work together towards reaching sustainable development targets. sharing national achievements, he said efforts are under way to boost state and social services in provinces nationwide. regretting to note the persistence of armed groups aimed at fuelling violence across the central african republic, he said the government has maintained its security and defense sectors, including the deployment of armed forces and the national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program. commending minusca and partners for their support, he asked for a lifting of the arms embargo, which is hampering the development of military forces. citing further gains, he said efforts have also aimed at combating impunity, including the establishment of the new special penal court and the truth and reconciliation commission. today, the government and people of the central african republic are resolutely engaging in consolidating democratic processes and economic growth, he said. despite challenges, his country remains determined in its efforts, he said, pledging to spare no effort to create conditions for reconciliation and reconstruction. thanking partners and the international community for their support, he expressed hope that they will remain committed to working with the central african republic to ensure further progress in his country’s recovery."
Chad,,"mahamat zene cherif, minister for foreign affairs, african integration and international cooperation of chad, said the session’s theme reminds all nations that humanity has no choice but to work together to rise to global threats and challenges in a manner based on universal values upon which the united nations was built. africa and more specifically the sahel region are currently facing some of those graves threats. surrounded by conflicts and crises in a region characterized by terrorism, trafficking, transnational crime and desertification, chad has taken steps to combat those threats, which are jeopardizing development gains. to overcome such challenges, cooperation is essential. indeed, a collective commitment of lake chad basin states led to boko haram’s defeat. ensuring peace and security is essential for long-term development, he continued, reiterating a call by the group of five for the sahel joint force requesting the security council to place its mandate under chapter vii of the united nations charter. in its own quest towards socioeconomic development, peace and security, he said that chad will prioritize partnerships based on results in improving conditions on the ground. departing from a patronizing approach, the government will take steps centered on building resilience through sustainable development. despite facing challenges, chad adopted a national development plan to reach those objectives. because women play a central role in development processes, the government passed a law in may introducing a 30 per cent quota for females in the civil service and in elected positions. turning to concerns about the lake chad basin, home to 45 million people, he said neighboring countries are working together to save the body of water from completely disappearing. but, they cannot do it alone, he said, appealing to the international community for support. more broadly, migration remains one of the greatest challenges in the region, he said, noting that unabated flows of africans fuelled by desperation continue to risk their lives to reach europe. a viable mechanism to manage migration must address the underlying causes, including poverty, under-development, conflict, climate change and population pressures. all nations must commit to make an economic and social effort to better manage migration and ensure the protection of migrants’ rights. the best way to rise to migration challenges is to establish flexible mechanisms and to consider the phenomenon as a way to bring people together rather than view them as a threat. highlighting challenges and progress, he first pointed at the central african republic, which chose the path of dialog and reconciliation. he also commended successful elections in mali, the recently signed south sudan peace accord and the ethiopian-eritrean agreement. turning to libya, he said the international community must support efforts leading to inclusive dialog and reconciliation. since the instability in libya has crossed borders into neighboring nations, he invited partners to support efforts in line with the n’djamena border security cooperation agreement, signed in may. concerned with the situation in syria and yemen, he reaffirmed support for united nations-led efforts to find a political solution to the crisis. preoccupied by the worsening situation between cuba and the united states, he encouraged the parties to work towards normalizing relations. in closing, he emphasized the need for security council reform, underlining an urgent need to allocate a permanent seat representing africa. “like it or not,” he said, “africa in the twenty-first century is indispensable and its voice must be heard.”"
Chile,,"sebastián piñera echeñique, president of chile, said the world is experiencing huge global transformation, creating new dangers as well as amazing new opportunities. based on western democracy and the social market economy, the world order that emerged following the cold war has given rise to new tensions as states are no longer the only actors on the international stage. the world has been unable to address serious threats to international security, including terrorism, drug trafficking, armed conflicts and transnational organized crime. turning to migration, he said large‑scale movements of people and their associated problems transcend the existing international order and required the action of all states. terrorism, war, hunger and totalitarianism are causing large cross‑border displacement. chile is experiencing the results from this phenomenon with the number of immigrants in the country swelling from 416 million in 2014 to 966 million in 2017. in that regard, he expressed chile’s commitment to the adoption of a policy that promotes safe, orderly and regular migration. the country’s policy seeks to strike a balance between the sovereign right of the state to regulate migrants and respect for their fundamental rights. the government has embarked on a mission to transform chile into a developed country, he went on to say, stressing the need for comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable development strategies. sustainable development calls for gender equality and a zero‑tolerance approach to gender‑based violence. states must be judged by how they treat their most vulnerable citizens. over the last four decades, humans have done harm to the health of the planet and world leaders will be judged on how they respond to the threat of climate change. nobody wants humans to be counted among extinct species. in response, his government is creating protected areas in biodiversity conservatories, committing itself to protection of the oceans, working towards a clean and safe energy matrix, and recognizing the threat posed by plastic pollution. in october, chile will mark 30 years since the referendum that opened the way to recovery of democracy, he said. however, there are other countries in the region that have not been able to begin such a transformation. the general assembly must listen to the people of venezuela who have been left voiceless by their government. that country is governed by an authoritarian regime, while in nicaragua over 400 people have died at the hands of government forces. the international community must act in the face of those violations, he stressed, adding that chile will not recognize the new government of venezuelan president nicolás maduro moros. the competence of the united nations to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security is now limited, he observed. the organization has lost the ability to prevent crises and strengthen the institutions of member states. the united nations structure, especially of its security council, does not respond to current needs and challenges. the council’s composition does not reflect the modern world, he noted, pointing to the underrepresentation of africa and latin america. only by reviving the values of freedom, peace and respect for human rights can the united nations fulfill its responsibilities."
China,"(translation) multilateralism, shared peace and development statement by h.e. wang yi state councilor and foreign minister of the people's republic of china at the general debate of the 73rd session of the un general assembly new york, 28 september 2018 madam president, every september, global attention focuses on the united nations and on this stately assembly hall people watch closely what is happening here, hoping that the united nations will deliver to the world peace, development, harmony and prosperity. people look to the un to help realize their dream for a better life, a un that is committed to ""making the united nations relevant to all people"", thus making our world a better place for everyone to live in. the contemporary international order, which began with the founding of the united nations, is based on the purposes and principles of the un charter and enhanced by the vision and practice of multilateralism. it has, over the past 70 years or more, brought about general peace and rapid development a people-centered philosophy has gained wide acceptance, and broad consensus has formed on the need for inter-dependence and win-win cooperation. yet, it is also true that the international order today faces problems and challenges and needs steady reform and improvement. the world is changing. as we celebrate mankind*s proud achievements and progress in an ever-changing world, we must never lose sight of the challenges and difficulties we face, and must remain vigilant. what we see today is that international rules and multilateral mechanisms are under attack, and the international landscape is filled with uncertainties and destabilizing factors. should we stay committed to multilateralism or let unilateralism have its way? should we seek to uphold the architecture of the world order or allow it to be eroded upon and collapse? these are questions of critical importance bearing on the future of all countries and the destiny of mankind, questions that all countries must carefully reflect on and seek answers to. china s answer is clear-cut. all along, china has upheld the international order and pursued multilateralism. though once kept out of the un for 22 years, china has never wavered in its conviction to multilateralism and to the purposes and principles of the un charter. china stayed true to its commitment throughout the negotiation process on its return to the gatt and then accession to the wto, negotiations that lasted 15 long years and were concluded at a certain price. china fulfilled its promise and integrated itself into the world economic system. after the international financial crisis broke out, china chose not to stand idly by but to work together with other countries to tide over rough times. for years running, china has contributed to over 30% ofglobal growth. it has played its part inhelping restore global recovery. in the face of new developments and severe challenges, china will keep to its commitment and remain a champion of multilateralism. standing at this podium back in 2015, chinese president xi jinping, in his statement reflecting the keen understanding of mankind's common interests and the future of our planet, called for building a community with a shared future for mankind. this major initiative is in keeping with the trend of history, and it echoes the call of the times. it adds to our conviction and strength as we pursue the common endeavor to protect this global village. it points to the direction for us to work together to open up an even better future for mankind. to uphold multilateralism in the new era, we believe the following principles need to be adhered to: first, we must pursue win-win cooperation. our world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. also unseen before are the problems and challenges we are faced with. no country can meet them alone or stay immune to their impact. what we need to do is to replace confrontation with cooperation and coercion with consultation. we must stick together as one big family instead of forming closed circles. we must promote common development through consultation instead of taking a winner-takes-all approach. this is a sure way for a bright future to be ushered in to the world. second, we must act upon rules and order. state-to-state relations should be based on credibility, not willful revocation of commitments. international cooperation should be guided by rules, not impulse. practicing multilateralism is, first and foremost, about upholding the un charteri observing international law and the basic norms governing international relations and honoring international agreements reached upon through negotiations. third, we must uphold fairness and justice. in international affairs, fairness and justice means equality between all countries, big or small. it means responsibility for big countries to help the small and the rich to assist the poor. fairness and justice also means respect for other countries' sovereignly, independence and territorial integrity, as well as their choice of development path and the right to a better life and to more development opportunities. fourth, we must act to deliver real results. multilateralism is not about making empty rhetoric. it must be pursued to solve problems. efforts must be targeted, results-oriented, and measured by visible progress. whether a multilateral mechanism works depends on the will and engagement of countries in the world. it is imperative that we work together to uphold the international system with the united nations at its core as well as the multilateral trading system centering on the world trade organization. multilateralism requires a strong united nations. china supports secretary-general guterres in his endeavor to advance reform of the un system in the three critical areas of peace and security, economic development and internal management. such reform should be led by member states. it should be designed to prioritize concerns of developing countries, make the un more efficient and enhance oversight and accountability. crucial to the un's proper functioning is stable and predictable funding. china will continue to fulfill its due financial obligations, and china calls upon other member states to pay their membership contributions and peacekeeping assessments on time and in full. madam president, the course ofdevelopment and progress for humanity is unstoppable. peace, reconciliation and harmony are the surging trend, while war, conflict and terror are opposed by all. equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation are the call of our times, whereas power politics and the law of the jungle find no support. as a major responsible country, china commits itselfto the path of peaceful development, and china will work with other countries and contribute its share to global peace and security. i since this year, the situation on the korean peninsula has seen a major turnaround thanks to the efforts of all parties concerned. china, on its part, has contributed to such development. china supports all-out improvement of relations between the north and the south of the peninsula, as well as efforts to facilitate dialogs between the dprkand the us, china encourages the dprk to continue moving along the right direction of denuclearization. at the same time, we believe it is also right for the us to make timely and positive responses so as to truly meet the dprk half way. china will continue to honor its due international responsibility and obligation, and will strictly implement security council resolutions related to the dprk. meanwhile, china calls upon the security council to take timely actions in light of the development and changes of the situation to create more favorable conditions for a peaceful settlement of the peninsula issue through political and diplomatic means. effective settlement of the issue requires complete denuclearization as well as establishment of a peace mechanism. only when the two wheels move in tandem can the issue be truly resolved and can peace start to dawn. regarding the iranian nuclear issue, now is a crucial time for continued implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa). the jcpoa is a consensus-based multilateral agreement endorsed by the un security council. it serves the comihon interests of all parties concerned and the international community at large. if the agreement fails to be implemented, the international nuclear non-proliferation regime will be undermined, the authority and role of the security council challenged, and peace and stability in both this region and the wider world jeopardized. that is a scenario in which no one stands to gain. china urges parties concerned to continue observing and implementing the jcpoa. on this basis, possibility could be explored for a dialog platform that is inclusive and transparent to facilitate proper settlement of each party's concerns through dialog andconsultation. the question of palestine must not be marginalized. for more than seven decades, peace and justice have remained elusive in that part ofthe world. on this issue, what the international community needs most is not proposal or initiative, but rather resolve and action. to implement the two-state solution, a new round of peace-promoting efforts need to be made to explore a new mediation mechanism. to that end, china will play its part and chinese humanitarian assistance to the palestinian people will continue. the issue involving rakhine state of myanmar cannot be resolved overnight, and steady progress needs to be made through a three-phased process involving cessation of violence, return of displaced persons and economic development. myanmar and bangladesh are inseparable neighbors, and could well be inseparable partners. yesterday, at my meeting with colleagues from myanmar and bangladesh and also in the presence of secretary-general guterres, agreement was reached between myanmar and bangladesh on accelerating the return of the first batch of displaced persons. we believe myanmar and bangladesh are capable of resolving this issue properly through friendly negotiations. china supports the un*s leading role in coordinating responses to non-traditional security challenges. in the new frontiers of global governance like cyber space and outer space, state sovereignty must be upheld, rules observed, and responsibilities honored. terrorism, a menace to the entire human society, should by no means be justified. security council resolutions must be earnestly implemented to counter cyber terrorism, terrorist financing and the spread of radical narratives, so as to remove the breeding ground ofterrorism. madam president, development is essential for our world today. we need to address both insufficient development and, more important, the imbalance in development. there is no one-size-fits-all model. eveiy country is entitled to explore a development path that suits itself to deliver happiness and security to its people, and bring a future of confidence and hope to its children. countries face various questions in development. questions themselves could be turned into drivers for reform, and solutions to problems could bring about development. economic globalization should not be a process for some to gain and others to lose, still less should it result in widening the gap between the north and the south. it is important that we adapt ourselves to the trend of economic globalization, and see to it that such a process is open, inclusive, balanced and win-win to deliver benefits to all. international trade is complementary and win-win by nature. it should not be a zero-sum game in which one gains at the expense of others, and no one should be allowed to place its own interest above the interest of others. protectionism will only hurt oneself, and unilateral moves will bring damage to all. regarding trade frictions, china stands for a proper settlement based on rules and consensus through dialog and consultation on an equal footing. china will not be blackmailed or yield to pressure. china has taken steps not just to defend its own legitimate rights and interests. china is also acting to uphold the free trade system and international rules and order for the benefit ofglobal recovery and the common interests of all countries. implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development should top the agenda ofthe current session ofthe general assembly. we need to incorporate the implementation of this agenda into the development strategies of member states and pursue innovation-driven, coordinated, green and open development that benefits all. we need to forge closer partnerships for development and pursue international development cooperation with the un at its center, north-south cooperation as the main channel, supplemented by south-south cooperation. to meet climate change is crucial to achieving sustainable development. china hopes to see negotiations on the implementation guidelines ofthe paris agreement be concluded, as scheduled, by the end of this yearto boost joint efforts for global ecological conservation. madam president, in pursuing our common cause for development and progress for humankind, china has worked in partnership with other countries of the international community. this year marks the 40th anniversary of china's reform and opening-up program. over the past 40 years, we have worked hard and forged ahead successfully along a path of socialism with chinese characteristics. this path has brought fundamental changes to china. over the past 40 years, more than 700 million of the chinese population have been lifted out of absolute poverty, which accounts for over 70% of the global total in the same period. a basic medical insurance system has been set up to cover the 1,35 billion chinese people, and a social pension network accessible to over 900 million people is now fiilly instituted. these are truly remarkable achievements in the history of human development. starting from scratch, china has built some 25,000 kilometers of high-speed railway. this accounts for two thirds of the global total and helps elevate global infrastructure construction. according to polls conducted by authoritative international polling agencies, china tops global rankings in terms of public satisfaction with its development and of public confidence in the future of development. the path of development china pursues has provided the world with opportunities for common development. over the past 40 years, china's foreign trade has registered an average annual growth of 14.5%. this has sustained impetus, for global growth and offered the world a huge chinese market. we have every confidence to maintain the momentum and realize high-quality development. china will speed up efforts to build an advanced economic system, and this will create greater trade opportunities and an even better investment environment for other countries. going forward, china will not reverse course or shut the door close. china will open still wider to the world. china will not erect market barriers but will expand access to the chinese market. of all developing countries in the world, china has been the fastest in opening up to a level that is unparalleled by others. when itcomes to overall tariff reduction, china has accomplished more than what it committed when joining the wto. the breadth ofchina's openness in services is close to the average level ofdeveloped countries. this november, china will host the first international import expo in shanghai. it will be yet another major step to open china's market. countries are welcome to take an active part in the event. the belt and road initiative proposed by president xi jinping is a public good china offers the world. indeed, it has grown into the largest platform for international cooperation. it aims to deliver benefits for all through consultation and cooperation. the initiative is open, transparent and inclusive; it is based on international rules and laws, and it aims to achieve green, environment-fnendly and sustainable development. it is about pursuing common prosperity through greater complementarity among participating countries. by september this year, over 130 countries and international organizations have signed agreements on belt and road cooperation with china. next year, china will host the second belt and road forum for intemational cooperation, and we welcome all parties to go and attend this event. china is the largest developing country in the world. to strengthen cooperation and solidarity with other developing countries has been and 10 will continue to be the staunch strategic priority for china's diplomacy. this is determined by what defines china as a country and by the system and values china upholds. no matter how much china has grown in strength, and however the international landscape may change, this strategic priority of china will remain unchanged. madam president, the united nations is the premium platform to advocate and practice multilateralism. we hope the current session of the general assembly will go down in the record for its part in upholding multilateralism and world peace and development. we hope that all of us in the international community will support the un in playing its central role in international affairs. and we call upon people of all countries to join hands and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind. ii","wang yi, minister for foreign affairs of china, underscored the importance of the principles enshrined in the united nations charter as well as the vision and practice of multilateralism. noting that a “people‑centered philosophy” has gained wide acceptance and broad consensus, he nevertheless warned that today the international order faces challenges and requires steady reform and improvement. “the world is changing,” he stated, emphasizing that international rules and multilateral mechanisms are under attack and the global landscape is filled with uncertainties and destabilizing factors. outlining the long‑standing support of china for and commitment to multilateralism, he said the country remained true to those commitments throughout negotiations on the world trade organization (wto) and the general agreement on tariffs and trade. china fulfilled its promise and integrated itself into the world economic system. more so, following the outbreak of the global financial crisis, it opted not to stand idly by but instead to work together with other nations to overcome rough times. “for years running, china has contributed to over 30 per cent of global growth,” he said, spotlighting its major role in helping to restore the international economy. vowing to continue to uphold those commitments, he also echoed president xi jinping’s calls to all nations to build a community with a shared future for humankind. in order to uphold multilateralism, the international community must pursue win‑win cooperation, understanding that no country can meet global challenges alone or remain immune to their impact. states must also act in line with rules and order, he stressed, urging inter‑state relations to be based on credibility — not wilful revocation of commitments. urging nations to uphold the principles of fairness and justice and aim to deliver real results, he said multilateralism requires a strong united nations, made more efficient and effective through reforms. “the course of development and progress for humanity is unstoppable,” he continued, underlining that peace, reconciliation and harmony are the “surging trend”. china stands committed to the path of peaceful development and will continue to contribute to global peace and security — including by supporting diplomatic efforts on the korean peninsula and the nuclear program of iran. voicing support for efforts to resolve the palestinian‑israeli conflict and the rohingya refugee crisis, he said terrorism — including cyberterrorism — can never be justified. while every country is entitled to explore a development path that suits itself, economic globalization should not be a process for some to gain and others to lose. “international trade is complementary and win‑win by nature,” he said, warning against zero‑sum mentalities, unilateralism and protectionism “that will only hurt oneself”."
Colombia,,"iván duque márquez, president of colombia, describing himself as part of a new generation of colombians, said that his country today was uniting around shared objectives. such efforts, which have earned the respect of the world and international investment, are building a path of progress with democratic institutions. economic growth is being maintained in the midst of complex regional volatilities, with cities transforming into productive sectors and the middle class expanding. while rising to the challenges of globalization the government is also focusing on social justice and bridging social gaps. towards that end, a plan is being developed to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030. stressing that peace requires the rule of law, he said his government will work towards completing the disarmament and reinsertion process that began some years back. the peace process his government inherited was fragile due to a lack of funds and the complex and dispersed institutional architecture, but colombia will fulfill its commitment vis‑à‑vis those who chose to turn away from violence. financial support of the international community will ensure that goal. the law will be enforced in an exemplary manner, he stated, adding that those who mock the victims and the generosity of the colombian people will feel the full weight of justice. “for peace to shine in columbia, we must overturn drug trafficking,” he said. noting that the recent incremental trafficking increase has become a fuel for organized crime, he expressed his will to break up the transnational crime networks. acknowledging that prevention is critical from a public health approach, he also stressed that the drug traffickers were predators. recently, his government joined the global call to action on the world drug problem, recognizing that all countries must contribute. “we will not accept as our destiny the addiction of so many youth,” he stated. he also stressed the importance of tackling corruption in a determined manner, as it is threat to democracy, social values and institutions. “from the first day of our government, we presented measures before congress”, launching an ambitious initiative supported nationwide. he also called for the international community to strengthen the sanction instruments and mechanisms to fight transnational corruption. no efforts should be spared to expedite the judiciary processes and sanctions in that regard. drawing attention to the situation of venezuelans fleeing their country, he stressed that colombia has opened its doors to close to a million of them. the humanitarian crisis in the region was caused by a “dictatorship that annihilates liberties”, he said. the international community must immediately demand the liberation of political prisoners, he continued, calling for the use of all international mechanisms to denounce, investigate and sanction those responsible for that situation."
Comoros,,"azali assoumani, president of the comoros, said that tackling global problems depended on reforms aimed at making the united nations more representative, equitable, efficient and able to fulfill its mission. that included allocating at least two permanent security council seats to african states, complete with veto power. equally important are concerted international and national efforts to fight the spread of disease. attention is also urgently needed to address crises in yemen, syria and palestine. on the latter, he pledged his country’s support for the palestinian people, calling on the general assembly to shoulder its responsibilities to help those facing grave danger. he also called on the assembly to address the urgent needs of the rohingya community. on the question of western sahara, he commended morocco’s efforts to find a political solution. more broadly, he reiterated a call to eliminate nuclear weapons and the very real threats they pose. addressing other global challenges, he said terrorism touched most countries and efforts must address anti‑islam rhetoric and pursue consensual language to define its different aspects. underlining the need to establish a process of cooperation and action to reduce terrorist threats, he expressed support for the joint forces currently active in the sahel region, highlighting the importance of swift, effective responses. in a similar vein, he said the comoros has been participating in negotiations ahead of the intergovernmental conference to adopt the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. among other things, this agreement reiterates commitments to address the root causes of migration through a lens of international cooperation and to protecting and promoting migrants’ human rights. sharp attention is also needed to combat climate change consequences, he said, emphasizing the particular needs of small island developing states. climate risks are destroying ecosystems and biodiversity, increasing both poverty levels and the spread of disease while triggering climate‑related migration. all stakeholders must shoulder their responsibilities, with cooperative efforts involving states, the private sector and individuals, to stop the tragic evolution of global warming. implementing the paris agreement on sustainable development is vital, he said, pointing at recent catastrophes that have ravaged every continent as a grim reminder that climate change is real. turning to national concerns, he said the comoros has experienced major socio‑economic progress, including a new initiative, assises nationales, supported by civil society. the national forum highlighted the need to redefine and reshape a new institutional framework. following a referendum held in july, a new constitution and elections have been announced. calling for support from international and regional partners, he expressed hope that such efforts would result in further progress. on the issue of the expulsion of comoros citizens from mayotte, he raised grave concerns about conditions that have led to children being abandoned. such actions are becoming a threat to the comoros and the region. the root of a misunderstanding between france and the comoros must be addressed, he said, offering to engage in dialog with france. he expressed determination to progress to work towards a fair resolution to the question of mayotte. together with france, he hoped to break the deadlock over the issue and find a lasting solution."
Congo,,"jean-claude gakosso, minister for foreign affairs and cooperation of congolese living abroad of congo, said peace is an invaluable treasure and the raison d’être of the united nations. however, the current global landscape has seen a rise in intolerance, racism and violence at a time when multilateralism is being challenged. threats include the spread of conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism, evolving trade wars and a migration crisis that continues to see thousands of people perishing in the mediterranean sea. decisive and collective action must address those and other grave concerns, with a view to fostering peace. as part of finding solutions to challenges facing africa, congo has hosted key debates on pressing problems, he said. the wider goal is ending violence and boosting development. satisfied with regional developments, he commended the democratic republic of the congo for its efforts to hold peaceful elections. turning to the central african republic, he called on all parties to join the peace process. calling for the restoration of peace across the continent, he emphasized that the united nations must play its role in ensuring safe elections without violence. for its part, congo is taking steps to pursue the ideals of peace and development. young people and women have been brought into development processes, he said, underlining the importance of including all groups and of respect for their human rights. after all, he continued, these groups will be the drivers of economic growth today and into the future. on climate change, he said efforts are under way to address environmental concerns, including preservation of the vast forests in central africa. calling on sponsors and donors for assistance to the governments of congo basin nations, he highlighted the importance of protecting these forest areas. the paris agreement and other global instrument must be boldly supported if they are to serve the cause of humankind and to protect life itself on this planet."
Costa Rica,,"epsy campbell barr, vice-president of costa rica, said that the fact that the united nations general assembly is presided over by a woman is part of a new moment in history in which gender equality is built on concrete action. for the first time, costa rica’s parliament has achieved gender parity. the country now benefits from the talent, capacity, knowledge and leadership of women in these positions of power. highlighting her commitment to gender parity in the united nations and the specific steps to achieve it, she said that women’s economic empowerment is important for their autonomy and their participation in the labor force significantly contributes to the economy, their families, communities and society in general. costa rica and the united kingdom will co-chair the group of champions for women's economic empowerment. costa rica’s defense doctrine is based on dialog and international law, she said. democracy must be based on a robust electoral system, the protection of human rights, a modern legal system and individual freedoms. costa rica wants to be a part of a community of nations with rules of co-existence. even though some countries protest the interference of united nations bodies or regret their financial contributions to the organization, for costa rica and for many other countries the united nations is “the last gleam of hope”, she said, adding: “we should not let them down”. condemning terrorism, which gravely affects women and girls, she stressed the importance of promoting justice, human rights and education, adding that costa rica rejects all forms of violence. since last year, costa rica has contributed to united nations peacekeeping, sending female police officers to serve as international observers for the united nations verification mission in colombia. on ending impunity, she expressed support for the international criminal court, and for bolstering it as victims deserved justice. costa rica supports complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula and lifting the embargo on cuba. she deplored the fact that sexual violence is used as a tactic of terror and a weapon of war to scare communities, reaffirming support for zero tolerance of such abuse. voicing support for multilateralism, she pointed at the iran nuclear agreement and the eritrean-ethiopian peace accord as examples. raising several other concerns, she said action was needed to advance the ban on nuclear weapons, and address human rights violations in nicaragua, and to work towards a global compact on managing migration. for its part, costa rica has taken many steps to work with all stakeholders, from civil society to the private sector. to achieve the 2030 agenda, she underlined the need to recognize the multidimensional nature of poverty while paying special attention to middle-income countries so they could reach objectives and targets. costa rica is now working on a plan focusing on green options for, among other things, waste management, agri-food systems and models for livestock development. emphasizing that the decarbonization of societies is this generation’s biggest challenge, she said costa rica aims at becoming a laboratory to do so, inviting member states to follow suit. “we can be part of a new, enlightened generation with an inspiring vision of our potential,” she said. “now is the time to forge a more sustainable, fairer future.” indeed, the young, “enlightened generation” must be robustly supported, as they are the ones who will truly change the world."
Croatia,"address by the president of the republic of croatip kolinda grabar-kitarovic at the united nations general assembly 2018 making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies new york, 26 september 2018 your excellencies, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, madam president ( aria fernanda espinosa garces), we live in times of great opportunit es and serious challenges. we are more interconnected than ever, yet the world remains divided in many ways. - - . ¦- ¦ technological developments have enabled our world to truly become a global village. our citizens have become global citizens and are well informed and strongly driven by developments around the world. they expect global leadership in these times of rapid changes and great complexity and look for inspiration in all of us. what is it that people are looking for today? what is it that they expect of a leader? mighty words? they don t really matter much anymore. mighty deeds? yes, indeed. but, foremost, what they expect of us are the simplest of gestures that bring us together, that show our compassion and respect for each other. they expect integrity and inspiration. this summer - of all things - football triggered a global response, uniting us for a moment in our common aspirations for excellence. af er the success of the croatian national team, i have received so many congratulatory letters and messages from all corners of the world. from china, australia and saudi arabia, from france, to trinidad and tobago and nepal. i thank everyone for their kind words. team croatia really played well... they won our hearts , kindly said vishal bagale of india, and shabbir allam wrote in croatian: „svi kao jedno!"" -,/ e're all like one!"" gilberto castillo of colombia pointed out: ""(final) muy merecida para un pais que se supera como gran ejemplo, despues de las duras situaciones historicas vividas. todo un ejemplo a seguir . i :y! opshori nondona, a 14 year old girl from dhaka, bangladesh, was especially persistent in getting her message through: this year, the whole world has recogniz d a small beautiful country - cro tia - through the passion and the power of football. now the world knows how powerful a small beautiful nation can b . this is just a fraction of sud 'mess ges and what most of tnem had in common, what i could read through each of themc s that croatia - a country not big in the size of its t rritory or the number of its population or its economic means - has thus become a metaphor for all of these kind peopl , of what a country can do to inspire others and to arrive on top of the world, winning the earts of people worldwide, and rousing enthusiasm that e ch of t eir countries can do the same. the value of a nation is not measured by its size, underlined bernard stem of france. and, indeed, to excel you don t need physical size; you need heart and persistence, and above all, you need to share a vision and to work together to make it happen. it is not the size of one's territory that matters; it is the size and quality of ideas. magnitude is not measured only in volume, but even more in determination to reach the goal. individual players might have shown gr at skill and technique in the field, but the reason that they triumphed was because they played together as a team. excellencies, the united nations is a place where we must show our willingness to act together and play together as a team. our adversaries are many: poverty, hunger, terrorism, extremism and instability, lack of education, gender inequali y and exclusion of women in many societies, environmental hazards, endangered security and trampled human dignity. we - the leaders - should think of ourselves as a team that needs to work together, to take advantage of our strengths and to 2 ' ¦ i' t address our weaknesses in order to make our world a better place and to inspire excellence globally. we should lea not only in managing crises and solving problems, but in spreading hop and optimism as w ll. we must demonstrate our humanity, solidarity and. 'compassion. in doing so we must, above all elsey respect eadi' othen respect is'the most 'valuable 'asset that we have in interpersonal and international relations. it is our responsibility as un member states to maintain the relevance, the effectiveness, and the efficiency of our organization and to be up-tothe-task for whatever challenge that may arise. however, raising awareness on the most pressing issues is not enough. we must also push for the adoption of the necessary instruments and frameworks and, most of all, secure their implementation. without such an approach this podium will remain merely a self-serving global stage. just words without deeds. throughout the years, we have learned, often the hard way, that governments and international organizations alike have their limits. this has also taught us of the value and importance of inclusiveness and of the important role that the private sector, academia, civil society and brilliant individuals can have in many ifferent fields. croatia has many a luka modric, and not only in sports. our people excel in so many areas: marin soljacic who is a modern day nikola tesla and develops a wireless transfer of energy; iva tolic with her breakthrough work in molecular cell biology; ivan mrvos, developer of smart city furniture for the cities of future; mate rimac with his electric cars, to name just a few among the countless others. let us push formal limits of our organizations away from us! let us embrace talent that is abundant around us! let us inspire through science and innovation, through our brilliant individuals at home and in our well established, hardworking diaspora around the world. let us inspire through our dedicated and tireless work in the united nations. deeds, not words. inclusion, not exclusion or isolation. empowerment. motivation. those are all keys to success. .we are the global village, out ore' often tftan nofe ...we tend to miss the opportunity to bring the global agenda to our homes, to'otierco munities and our families. likewise, we forget to include our homes, communities and families on the global agenda. it takes great tragedi s caused by catastrophes, global cri es, wars and climate change, to remind us of what we ll s an o lose. in today s world, such an approach embodied in multilateralism is under ever-increasing strain. this is of particular concern since the most important issues for the mankind cannot be resolved by any state singlehandedly, or in isolation. ultilateralism is indispensable, but i would agree with those who call for changes in the multilateral system. we should not be complacent, and we need to rethink ecades old mechanisms and instruments in order to adapt them to the modern times and contemporary needs. excellencies, as we celebrate two very important anniversaries this year - 70 years of the universal declaration of human rights and 25 years of the vienna declaration and program of action - it is a fitting occasion to remember that respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law has always been a precondition for long-term stability, peace and development. we should not forget the 70th anniversary of the convention on the preven ion and punishment of the crime of genocide either. we must learn from the tragedies of srebrenica and rwanda, a shame for united nations as described by the great secretary-general kofi annan, to whom i pay a special tribute. these darkest hours must never be forgotten. 4 ladies and gentlemen this year croatia marked its fifth year of membership in th european union. croatia is a tell ng example of the transformative force of the eu memb rship, of the benefits: 'of--accession 'to the area where p ace, freedom/ human dignity and prosperity are standards, not mereide lsr for these reasons, among others;; oatia strongly supports further eu enlargement to our south-eastern neighborhood. r solving all outstanding l gacies of war, while constructively engaging in regional cooperation and good neighborly relations is essential. within this framewor we will continue to focus especially on th rights of minorities, missing persons, war crimes jurisdiction, victims of war, and domestic processing of war crimes. good and mutually beneficial neighborly relations depend on a large egree on the words co ing from across the border. for inflammatory and revisionist rhetoric, spurr d by the need for domestic political needs, takes just a moment to be spoken; however, to repair the damag cause by t k s much, much longer. in bosnia and herzegovina, our closest neighbor and a country of utmost importance for croatia, we see a risk of legal uncertainty and political and institutional instability after the upcoming october elections, due to the failure to amend the electoral framework so that it fully respects the rights and equality of the three constituent peoples bosniaks, croats and serbs - in line with the constitutional court decision on the legitimate and proportionate representation of constituent peoples at all levels of government, including the presidency. although the belgrade-pristina dialog is for the two sides to resolve, we should b cautious and extremely careful when it comes to proposals with potential regional implications, most notably the ideas regarding territorial (ex)changes: otherwise, we may (re)open the pandora s box 5 of potential new territorial claims potentially provo ing serious instability and security threats. there are inspiring developments demonstrating brave leadership as well. we warmly welcome the signing of th agreement on the name issue'whietr has been rec ntly r ached betw en skopje and thens an ¦hope that the referendum this synday ill represent ¦a crucial impetusfor th ooiystey s successful continuation of its euro-atlanticrintegraf on. ladies and gentlemen, by a opting the 2030 agen a, along with the historic paris agreement on climate change, and th addis ababa action agenda, we have sent a powerful message that there is hope for a brighter future. however, to succeed in our endeavors, we need to mobilize all partners to work together. this way we can chieve social progress, protect the environm nt, create economic growth an build a more just, stable and peac ful world. runaway climate change is one of the most serious threats that w regularly witness - from heat waves and forest fires, no longer contained to california or m diterran an, but also in places such as scandinavia to historic typhoons in japan or in the philippines, and the melting of ice sheets on the planet s poles. no country can shield itself from the negative ffect of climate change. croatia is no exception to that. with over one thousand islands, islets and reefs and a rich history of mediterranean h ritage, implementing goals of the 2030 agenda now is crucial for croatia s future. all over the world, croatia included, we are recording changes in sea temperature and have witnessed unprecedented and irreversible changes in ecosystems. in croatia's beautiful adriatic sea, one of the cleanest in the world, we have already registered more than 20 new 6 species of tropical fish, some of them extremely invasive that can irreparably shif the environmental balance. soon we may be exposed to th danger of rising sea levels, which is already a question of exist nce for many small islands around the world. it is estimated that the sea level irtthe' adriatic-will rise by almost half a meter y 2100; ub'merging' arts' pf world.- heritage places and treasures like split, trogir or dubrovnik. thisas hy climate action is not an abstract issue, but a serio s mat er r quiring our constant and undivided attention. one of the most important climate action and sustainable development issues for croatia is rev rsing demographic trends on our isl nds. they are turning into places where schools are without children, and churches record funerals rather than baptisms and weddings. and yet, the problems that many of these islands face are common globally. we ne d to improve affordable transportation and connections between the islands and the mainland. we need to resolv water supply and provide dean water and sanitation. we need to invest in education, technology, science and innovation so that societies and families will once gain flourish on the islands. blue growth could be a solution. it is a long-term strategy to support sustain ble growth in the marine and maritime sectors as a whole. s as are driv rs of the economy and have great potential for innov tion and growth, set to grow at twice the rate of the mainstream economy by 2030. growth is especially welcome in a number of areas, such as: sustainable coastal tourism, new health benefits, better connectivity of islands, sustainable blue growth and jobs, marine biotechnology, renewable energy, managing maritime ecological threats and preserving eco¬ systems and biodiversity, but also improving safety and security in terms of maritime traffic and cross-border maritime pollution. 7 i ;r . ? 't one of the issues that i would like to emphasize today in particular is marine litter, a problem of increasing concern that threatens marine life in all the world s oceans, impacting more than 600 marine species. the croatian coastal areas are severely affected by poorly managed waste from our southern adriatic neighbors. -we ' ave t addres the rising probiemf of plastic pollution iir our..seas and oceans rgently if we ""want to leave a liveable world to futuregenerations. plastic ebris - and each year around eight million tons of it ends up in our oceans and seas - is particularly worrying because it is resistant to environmental breakdown. plastic pollution does not only impact sea life, it also carries toxic pollutants into the food chain with us humans on top of it. we can solve this problem and we can start by educating and engaging everyone in a conversation to rethink plastic, by challenging societ 's perception that this indestructible substance can be treated as disposable . particular attention should be given to the ocean cleanup project in this regard. it is designing and developing the first feasible method to rid the world's oceans of plastic and its first mission to remove 50% of the great pacific garbage patch in just five years started several weeks ago. in the media they have called it pac man, referring to a popular old videogame. the young man behind the invention is a brilliant scientist of croatian origin living in the netherlands bojan slat, and he well deserves to be given credit here today, beneath the un logo, which clearly shows our oceans. my country is already actively preparing for the fulfillment of its obligations un er the paris agreement excellencies, this was the year of un reforms in more ways than one; not only through results achieved in the pivotal sectors of peace and security, 8 development and un management but also in the transformational nature of our mutual efforts to make our organization fit for the 21st century. the world has changed profoundly since 1945 an the birth of the un. in our reforms it is essential that we strike the right balance between the maintenance of the basic framework based on the un charter and.the flexibility required by new realities and conte porary needs. in pursuing un' 'reforms : los agenda. ight of the 2030 we need a u capable of coping with unceasing ch ng s and growing challenges in the international arena, be it n the field of regional security, conflict management, threats to the environment, human rights, or frontline technologies that transform profoundly the fields of labor and disarmament ali e. i use this opportunity to highly commend the secretary-general and his team for their tireless reform efforts. ther is still a lot of work ahead of us, but we shoul e cont nt with the results an trajectories establishe in 2018. ladi s and gentlemen, if we want to mov forward, and leave no one behind; if we truly strive to make the un more r levant and, in doing so, more effective, we also nee to realize that the un is and should e much more than just ew york, geneva, vienna, nairobi, or any conference location. multilateralism starts from our own homes and in our own minds. it must not be an annual event. it needs to be our daily routine, a way of doing business in the world. e erything that we want to achieve globally, everything that we have agreed so far under this dome, will be easier to accomplish with the understanding and support of our citizens. 9 in order to face all the adversities and adversaries th t i mention in my spe ch, both as deliver d in the more complete, written version that you have received, we must show determination to take on the risk of decision-making. we must open ourselves to new ideas. and we must show emotion, empathy and, above all, enthusiasm. enthusiasm is contagious! • ' as nelson mandefe (fyiadf ), whose centenary e celebrated two days ago, said, it always seems impossible until it done thank you. 10","kolinda grabar-kitarović, president of croatia, said her country’s football team competing in the fifa world cup final united the world with accolades from around the globe that expressed a common aspiration for excellence. croatia, not big in size, population or economic means, showed that success is achieved through teamwork. likewise, members of the united nations must act as a team to maintain its relevance and effectiveness in the face of various global challenges. highlighting croatia’s fifth year of membership in the european union, she underscored how her country was a telling example of the transformational force of being in that bloc, adding that freedom and prosperity have become standards, not just mere ideals. she expressed strong support for further european union enlargement to her country’s southeastern neighbors, while cautioning against the long‑lasting damage caused by inflammatory and revisionist rhetoric used to address short‑term domestic political needs. there is a risk of legal uncertainty and political and institutional instability in bosnia and herzegovina after the upcoming october elections, she stated, adding that this is due to the failure to amend the electoral framework to fully respect the rights and equality of the three constituent peoples — bosnians, croats and serbs in line with the constitutional court decision on the legitimate and proportionate representation of constituent peoples at all levels of government, including the presidency. while acknowledging the belgrade‑pristina dialog must be completed by the two concerned parties, she warned against proposals with potential regional implications, notably territorial modifications or exchanges. opening the “pandora’s box of potential new territorial claims” could generate serious instability and security threats, she added. recalling that no country can shield itself from the consequences of climate change, she said that, with over one thousand islands, islets and reefs, croatia may soon be exposed to the danger of rising sea levels. while stressing the need of balanced united nations reforms, she welcomed the results and trajectories established in 2018. “multilateralism starts from our own homes and in our own minds,” she said, adding that “it must be our daily routine”."
Cuba,"statement by h.e. mr. miguel diaz-canel bermudez, president of the republic of cuba for the general debate of the 73° session of the un general assembly. new york, 26 september 2048. madam president: mister secretary-general: it is impossible to be here, speak from this rostrum on behalf of cuba, and not recall historic moments of the general assembly which are also part of our dearest memories: fidel castro, che guevara, raul castro and the ""chancellor of dignity"", racil roa, just to mention the most significant, have brought here not only the voice of our people but also the voice of other latin american and caribbean, african, asian, non-aligned peoples, with whom we have shared more than half a century of struggles for a fair international order, which is still far to be attained. it is absurd but consistent with the irrationality of a world in which the richest 0.7% of the population owns 46% of all the wealth, while the poorer 70% of the population can access only 2.7% of it; 3.460 billion people survive in poverty; 815 million go hungry; 758 million are illiterate and 844 million lack basic services of drinking water. all these figures, by the way, are prepared and regularly used by global organizations, but it seems that they have failed to raise sufficient awareness of the so called international community. these realities. madam president, are not the result of socialism, like the president of the united states said yesterday here. they are the consequence of capitalism, especially imperialism and neoliberalism; of the selfishness and exclusion that is inherentto that system, and of an economic, political, social and cultural paradigm that privileges wealth accumulation in the hands of a few at the cost of the exploitation and dire poverty of the large majorities. capitalism consolidated colonialism. it gave birth to fascism, terrorism and apartheid and spread wars and conflicts, the breaches of sovereignty and self-determination of the peoples; repression on workers, minorities, refugees and migrants. capitalism is the opposite of solidarity and democratic participation. the production and consumption patterns that characterize it, promote plundering, militarism, threats to peace; they generate violations of human rights and are the greatest danger to the ecological balance of the planet and the survival of the human being. no one should be deceived by anybody claiming that humanity lack enough material, financial and technological resources to eradicate poverty, hunger, preventable diseases and other scourges. what is lacking is the political will of the industrialized countries, who have the moral duty, the historical responsibility and the abundant resources to solve the most pressing global problems. the truth is that while it is claimed that there is a shortfall in funding to attain the goals and targets of the 2030 agenda or address the increasing impact of climate change, 1.74 triilion dollars were wasted in military expenditure in the year 2017, the highestfigure since the end of the cold war. climate change is anotherunavoidable reality and a matter ofsurvival for the human species, particularly for small island developing states. some of its effects are already irreversible. scientific evidence indicates there is an increase of 1.1° c relative to pre-industrial levels, and that 9 out of 10 persons living in urban areas breath polluted air. • however, the united states, one of the major polluters of yesteryear and today, refuses to accompany the international community in the implementation of the paris agreement on climate change. it thus endangers the lives of future generations and the survival of all species, including humans. in addition, and like there were not enough threats on humanity and its dazzling creations, it is a fact that the military and nuclear hegemonism of imperialism is perpetuating itself and expanding to the detriment ofthe hopes of the majority ofpeoples for a general and complete disarmament. cuba shares this ideal and, as testament of its commitment with this goal, on last 31 january, it became the fifth state to ratify the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. in this organization that was born out of the human desire to overcome the destruction left by a terrible war with the dialog between nations, it is not possible to keep quiet about the danger looming over all of us, with the exacerbation of local conflicts, wars of aggression disguised as ""humanitarian interventions"", the forceful overthrow of sovereign governments, the so-called ""soft coups"" and interference in other states' internal affairs, recurrent forms of action by some powers, using the most diverse excuses. the international cooperation for the promotion and protection of all human rights for all is a must. however, its discriminatory and selective manipulation with claims of domination, violatesthe rights to peace, self-determination and development ofthe peoples. cuba rejects the militarization of outer space and cyberspace, as well as thecovert and illegal use of the information and communication technologies to attack other states. the exercise of multilateralism and full respect for the principles and rules of international law to advancetowards a multipolar, democratic and equitable world, are required in order to ensure peaceful coexistence, preserve international peace and security and find lasting solutions for systemic problems. against that logic, the threat or use of force, unilateralism, pressures, retaliations and sanctions which increasingly characterize the behavior and rhetoric of the us government and its abusive use ofthe veto power in the security council in order to impose their political agenda, pose huge challenges and threats within the united nations itself. why don't we just implement the promised strengthening of the general assembly as the main organ of deliberation, decision and representation. the reform of the security council must not be delayed or prevented, as this organ is in need of adjusting to the times by democratizing its membership and working methods. today we have come to reiterate what commander-in-chief fidel castro ruz said on the occasion ofthe fiftieth anniversary ofthe un, which summarizes the most noble aspiration of the majority of the humanity, and iquote: ""we want a world without hegemonistic practices, without nuclear weapons, without interventionism, without racism, without national orreligious hatred, without violations of the sovereignty of any country, with respect for independence and the free self-determination of peoples, without universal models that do not take into account the traditions and cultures of all components of humanity at all. without cruel blockades that kill men, women, children, the young, and the elderly like silent atomic bombs"". more than 20 years have elapsed since that demand was made and none of those ills have been cured; in fact, they have exacerbated. we have every right to ask why. and we have the duty to insist on effective and equitable solutions. madam president: our america is currently the stage of persistent threats, inconsistent with the ""proclamation of latin america and the caribbean as a zone of peace"", signed in havana by the heads of states and government on the occasion of the 2""*^ summit of the community of latin american and caribbean states, in 2014. the current us administration has proclaimed the relevance of the monroe doctrine and, in a new deployment of its imperial policy in the region, is attacking venezuela with special cruelty. it is in this threatening context that we wish to reiterate our absolute support to the bolivarian and chavista revolution, the civic-military union of the venezuelan people and its legitimate and democratic government, led by the constitutional president nicolas maduros moros. we reject the intervention attempts and sanctions against venezuela, aimed at suffocating her economically and hurting the venezuelan families. we likewise reject the attempts at destabilizing the nicaraguan government, a country of peace that has made a remarkable social, economic and public safety progress in favor of its people. we denounce the politically-motivated imprisonment of former president luiz incicio lula da silva, and the decision to prevent the people from voting and electing brazil's most popular leader to the presidency. we stand in solidarity with the caribbean nations who demand legitimate reparation for the horrible effects of slavery as well as the fair, special and differential treatment that they deserve. we reaffirm our historic commitment with the self-determination and independence of our brother people of puerto rico. we support argentina's legitimate sovereignty claim over the malvinas islands, south sandwich and south georgia islands. we reiterate our unrestricted support to a comprehensive, just and lasting solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict, on the basis of the creation of two states, allowing the palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and to have an independent and sovereign state based upon the pre-1967 borders, with east jerusalem as its capital. we reject the unilateral action of the united states to establish their diplomatic representation in the city of jerusalem, which heightens even more the tensions in the region. we condemn the barbarities of the israeli forces against civilian population in gaza. we reaffirm our steadfast solidarity with the saharan people, and support the search for a final solution to the question of western sahara, which will allow the exercise of selfdetermination and to live in peace in their territory. we support the search for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the situation imposed in syria, without foreign interference and with full respect to their sovereignty and territorial integrity. we reject any direct or indirect intervention, carried out without the legitimate authorities of the country. the continued expansion of nato towards russian border is causing serious threats, worsened by the imposition of arbitrary sanctions, which we reject. we demand compliance with the islamic republic of iran's nuclear deal. we welcome the process of rapprochement and dialog among the koreas. this is the way to achieve a lasting peace, reconciliation and stability in the korean peninsula. at the same time, we strongly condemn the imposition of unilateral and unfair sanctions against the democraticpeople's republic of korea and foreign interference in korean internal affairs. the violations of the rules of international trade and the sanctions against china, the european union and other countries will bring about harmful effects, particularly for developing states. we favor dialog and cooperation, thanks to which we can report today that the cuba-eu agreement on political dialog and cooperation has provisionally entered into force and is a goodfoundation to develop beneficial ties between the parties. madam president: the government ofthe us keeps an aggressive rhetoric towards cuba and maintains a policy aimed at subverting the political, economic, social, economic and cultural system in my country. contrary to the interests of both peoples and giving in to the pressures of minority sectors, the new us government has devoted itself to artificially fabricate under false pretexts, scenarios of tension and hostility serve nobody's interests. this is in contrast with the fact that we have formal diplomatic relations and mutually beneficial cooperation programs in a limited number of areas. our peoples share increasingly closer historic and cultural bonds, which are expressed in the arts, sports, science, the environment, among others. the potential for a fluent business relationship is well known and a genuine and respectful understanding would be in the interest of the entire region. however, the essential and defining element of the bilateral relationship continues to be the blockade, which seeks to suffocate the cuban economy in order to generate hardships and disrupt the constitutional order. it is a cruel policy, punishing cuban families and the entire nation. it is the most comprehensive and long-standing system of economic sanctions ever implemented against any country. it has been and continues to be a major obstacle to the country's development and to the realization of the aspirations to progress and well-being of several generations of cubans. as has been said for so many years in this same place, due to its aggressive extraterritorial implementation, the blockade seriously damages the sovereignty and interests of all countries. on behalf of the cuban people, i would like to thank this general assembly for the virtually unanimous rejection to the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the united states against my country. nevertheless, the actions of the us government against my country go farther. it includes public and covert programs of gross interference in cuba's internal affairs. to this end, tens of millions of dollars that are officially allocated in its budget are used, in violation of the standards and principles upon which this organization rests, and in particular, of cuba's sovereignty as an independent nation. cuba stands ready to develop respectful and civilized relations with the us government on the basis of sovereign equality and mutual respect. this is the will of the cuban people and we know this is a shared aspiration by most us citizens and, particularly, by cubans living there. we shall continue to tirelessly demand the end of the cruel economic, commercial and financial blockade, the return of the territory illegally occupied by the guantanamo naval base and adequate compensation to our people for the thousands of dead and disabled and forthe economic and property damages caused to cuba over so many years of aggression. cuba will always be willing to engage in dialog and cooperate on the basis of respect and equal footing. we shall never make concessions affecting the sovereignty and national independence, we shall not negotiate our principles nor shall we accept conditionalities. in spite of the blockade, the hostility and the actions carried out by the united states to impose a regime change in cuba, the cuban revolution is right here, alive and strong, faithful to her principles! madam president: the generational change in our government should not raise the hopes of the enemies ofthe revolution. we are the continuity, not a rupture. cuba has continued taking steps to improve its model of economic and social development in order to build a sovereign, independent. socialist, democratic, prosperous and sustainable nations. this is the path that our people has freely chosen. the country will not go back to the opprobrious past that it shook off with the greatest sacrifices during 150 years of struggle for independence and full dignity. by the decision of the overwhelming majority of cubans, we shall continue the work that started almost 60 years ago. in this conviction, we began a constitutional reform process, a truly participatory and democratic exercise, through popular discussion of the draft which will eventually be approved in a referendum. i am certain that there will be no changes in our strategic objectives and that the irrevocable nature of socialism will be ratified. the principles of foreign policy will remain unchanged. as the first secretary of our party, raul castro ruz, said on his statement on the occasion of the 70 anniversary of the united nations, and iquote: ""the international community will always be able to count on the cuba's sincere voice against injustice, inequality, underdevelopment, discrimination and manipulation; and for the establishment of a fairer and more equitable international order, whose center is placed, really on the human being, its dignity and wellbeing"". the cuba on behalf of which i speak today is the proud successor of that independent, sovereign, fraternal and solidarity policy with the poorest of this world, producers of all the wealth in the planet, although the unequal global order has sentenced them with dire poverty on behalf of words like democracy, freedom and human rights, words which the rich have actually emptied of meaning. it has been exciting and pleasant to take the floor at the same rostrum from which fidel expressed powerful truths 58 years ago. that still continue to shake us in front of representatives of more than 190 nations who, rejecting extortion and pressures, every year fill the voting screen of worthy green lights of approval to our demand for the end of the blockade. i bid you farewell in the hope that the noble aspirations of most of the humanity will be achieved before younger generations take this rostrum to demand the same as we do today and our historic predecessors did in yesteryear. thank you very much.","miguel díaz-canel bermúdez, president of cuba, recalled historic moments of the general assembly where fidel castro, che guevara, raúl castro, and the “chancellor of dignity”, raúl roa, all brought not only the voice of cuba but the voice of latin american, caribbean, african, asian, and all non-aligned people struggling for a fair international order. pointing out that the

went on to say that the current united states administration is attacking venezuela with special cruelty, reiterating his country’s support for the bolivarian and chavista revolution, the civic-military union of the venezuelan people. he also denounced the attempts at destabilizing the nicaraguan government and the politically motivated imprisonment of luiz inácio lula da silva. he voiced support for the independence of puerto rico and argentina’s legitimate sovereignty claim over the malvinas islands*. he also reiterated his call for a just and lasting solution to the israeli‑palestinian conflict and reaffirmed solidarity with the saharan people. noting the continued expansion of the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) towards the russian federation border, he rejected the imposition of arbitrary sanctions. he also pointed out that the new united states government was devoting itself to artificially fabricating scenarios of tension; such actions are in contrast with formal diplomatic relations in several areas – historic and cultural bonds, which are expressed in arts, sports, science and the environment. “however the essential and defining element

willing to engage in dialog."
Cyprus,"statement by his excellency the president of the republic of cyprus mr. nicos anastasiades t the gener l deb te of the 73rd session of the general ssembly of the u ited tio s mr. president, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, at the outset, let me congratulate the newly elected president of this session, mrs. maria fernanda espinosa garces, and assure of my government s unwavering support to her mission. i would like also to pay tribute to the memory of the recently deceased former un secretary-general, mr. kofi annan, who, with his charismatic and measured approach, redefined the united nations and actively championed the ideals which characterized his ethos: peace-making and peace-keeping, international co-operation and sustainable development. also, in honoring the centenary of the birth of the great statesman and world leader, nelson mandela, we express our great admiration and gratitude for his active promotion of the noble values of peace, justice and equality. ladies and gentlemen, cyprus fully endorses the theme chosen for this year s session of the general assembly: «global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies)). and we fully subscribe to it, as, of course, the majority of un members, since the theme itself in its essence reminds us of the founding principles of the un on which millions of people and many countries vested their hopes for a better future. an organization which emerged from the ashes of war for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security, underpinning the respect and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, irrespective of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief. 2 this order is based on multilateralism, collective action and international co-operation among states having sovereign equality. however, one might contemplate if we have failed to uphold the said values, by wondering: how is it then that we come back again and again, year after year, as a kind of ritual, to attest to the dismal lack of effectiveness for some and the embellishment attempt for others, for what is in fact our inability to fulfill the aims of the un charter? why do the decisions of the security council remain in their overwhelming majority sheer certificates attesting violations? why is international law and international agreements not implemented? why do strategies and programs aiming at creating better conditions for people that are suffering, remain wishful thinking? 3 when will we finally really take our destiny into our own hands, fully assuming our responsibilities towards our peoples and towards humanity as a whole? ladies and gentlemen, as a leader of a small country, which suffers for more than 44 (fourty- four) years by the blatant violations of international law, let me repeat the well-known causes which explain all these unacceptable and disappointing results, registered both at the regional and global level. i would dare mention sad realities candidly, but honestly, in order for states and international organizations to consider readjusting their policies and actions with a view of upholding real hope for a better future. in this effort, in this struggle, we must ensure the cooperation of all, but more so of the states and the peoples that are the victims, those suffering from phenomena such as: (i) the primacy of expansionist interests of a state against the territorial integrity, peace and prosperity of other countries and peoples; (ii) the investments and promotion of the military industry and infrastructure, through the fomentation of conflict in order to secure their own profitability; (iii) the passive observance of violations of international law, such as the annexation of territories, fuelling separatism and civil wars, in order not to poison relations and common interests between friendly countries; (iv) financing and promoting of terrorism by some states, in order to impose religious fundamentalism; (v) while more than 20 (twenty) million people in north-eastern nigeria, south sudan, yemen and somalia face famine and are in need of urgent assistance, whereas more than 820 (eight-hundred) million people, including 155 (one hundred and fifty-five) million children suffer from chronic malnutrition, there are countries in which immense quantities of animal and plant products are destroyed for the sake of narrow and blind economic and commercial considerations. (vi) while child mortality and life - threatening diseases persevere and health services provided are below acceptable levels, we continue to face inflexible policies and practices, emasculating competent authorities from providing the necessary medical care. (vii) instead of facing the root causes leading to massive migratory flows of millions of people, we contend ourselves in setting up immigration detention centers. 6 (viii) while we adopt the paris agreement to address the global challenge of climate change, specific interests hinder either the design or the implementation of domestic policies which would deliver on our pledge and commitments. ladies and gentlemen, all the above, in addition to the inability to effectively implement the resolutions of the un, have led to unprecedented crises and have resulted in a lack of credibility, trust and even legitimacy of our decisions, bringing about: • forcible displacement of millions of people; • hunger and distress which intensify migration flows, create demographic changes and exert huge economic and social pressures to all countries or regions affected; • human and drug trafficking; and, • destruction of cultural heritage. 7 distinguished friends, despite diverging aspirations or conflicting interests, we should rise to meet our shared responsibility, reverse our policies of the political expediencies which i have referred to, adopt a more proactive, targeted and results-oriented approach and address the root causes that have led to this unprecedented situation. we should intensify our efforts towards making sustainable development finally a reality for all countries and regions in need, through establishing the necessary political and socio-economic conditions which would lead to stability, economic growth and institution building. at the same time, we should also efficiently confront the threats posed by ongoing conflicts in order to achieve lasting and viable political solutions that will promote regional peace, security and predictability and save future generations from the plague of asymmetric threats. collective leadership and the primacy of multilateralism is the only way forward to effectively eliminate threats to peace and security. 8 therefore, we need to strengthen our support and commitment to the un and safeguard the effective implementation of its decisions, as well as its actions, on the basis of justice and international law, which constitute the core and essence of this organization. ladies and gentlemen, it is in this context that we lend our unwavering support to the ambitious vision of the secretary general, mr. antonio guterres, to reform the organization, in a manner that corresponds to the needs of its member states and meets the expectations of our peoples. with regard to the reform of the development pillar, we reiterate our full commitment to strengthening the capacity of the united nations to become more effective and transparent, in pursuance of the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. an agenda which forms an integral part of our efforts to help all people live in dignity. 9 in parallel, further action needs to be undertaken to address the vulnerability of states to climate change, in particular small island states, while we also need to put more emphasis and accelerate efforts to implement the sustainable development goals. bearing in mind the ongoing unstable situation and conflicts in syria, iraq, yemen, libya, nigeria, myanmar, afghanistan, the sahel, the long-standing israeli - palestinian conflict and, of course, the still unresolved problem of the forcible division of my country, we should attach particular importance to the peace and security pillar reform. we fully concur with the notion of the primacy of diplomacy in peace¬ making and conflict-resolution and the supportive, yet catalytic, role of peace-keeping operations therein. we ought to admit, however, that the former is jeopardized without the latter and that in the absence of a negotiating process, the need for peace-keeping becomes much greater and indispensable. the situation in my country offers a meaningful example in this regard. 10 therefore, while we remain deeply committed to adopting necessary reforms in this pillar, we strongly believe that each peace-keeping operation should be evaluated on its own merit, based on actual needs and threats on the ground. the risks involved are far too grave to allow for any experimentations in this regard. ladies and gentlemen, my country, albeit being a member of the european union, is however located at the epicenter of an area of extreme volatility and instability. our quest is based in our vision and ambition to be a beacon of stability, predictability and creating synergies in promoting shared prosperity and stability for all. 11 to this end, and being accepted by all as an honest broker with no hidden agenda, we have reinforced our historic close ties with the countries of our immediate region and, alongside greece, we have established trilateral partnerships with neighboring countries, including egypt, israel, lebanon, jordan and palestine. these trilateral mechanisms constitute a fitting example of what can be achieved when countries with shared concerns and common interests join powers, instead of isolating themselves. in short, these trilateral partnerships are a practical expression of effective multilateralism, fully in line with the theme of the un: «shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies». as such, they are neither exclusive, nor directed against any third country. on the contrary, they institutionalize co-operation and dialog in our region, particularly in areas in which there are comparative advantages, as for example, in the field of energy. 12 in this regard, we warmly welcome the expansion of these trilateral formats to include additional partners in specific fields of mutually beneficial collaborations. ladies and gentlemen, when talking about the importance of achieving peace and stability in our immediate neighborhood and the means through which it can be accomplished, i feel obliged to stress the significance and the consequent multiple benefits that would arise by reaching a comprehensive solution of the cyprus problem. first and foremost, a viable and lasting settlement would be to the best interest of the people of cyprus, greek and turkish cypriots, and their aspiration to live in a normal and prosperous european country, fully independent and free from any foreign dependencies. at the same time, i remain convinced that the solution of the cyprus problem will undoubtedly have a very important collateral influence on achieving and maintaining a much-needed environment of stability and peace in the region. 13 last, but not least, the solution of an international problem which has been on the agenda of the united nations in the last decades, will offer a beacon of hope that even the most intractable problems can be solved peacefully through the united nations. unfortunately, as the peace process remains at an impasse since the conference on cyprus of july 2017, i am deeply concerned about the lapse of time and its consequences. dear friends, let me be clear: only a viable and functional solution, in line with our eu membership and the best practices of democratic countries of the un, can establish the conditions for achieving lasting peace, allowing my country to fully take its stride and for all cypriots to live in a normal state and work together for the prosperity and security of all. 14 as i have repeatedly stated: i remain strongly and truly committed to achieve a solution on the basis of the relevant un resolutions and the european union acquis, continuing the negotiations on the six-point framework that the un secretary - general has set as the basis for the way forward. the un secretary - general and his good offices mission is the only way forward. we expect turkey, which has a key role in the efforts to reach a settlement, to rise to the occasion and demonstrate the necessary political determination to reach a settlement and concretely contribute to regional stability. on our own behalf, i wish once more to repeat that we are determined to rise to the challenge of our historic responsibility and do our utmost so as to provide a peaceful future for all cypriots and the region. 15 mr. president, ladies and gentlemen, in a fragmented and multipolar world, we have more than ever the moral, ethical and political duty to promote the essence of human civilization, unite our strength to maintain international peace and security and establish the conditions which would bring prosperity and welfare for all. this is exactly the theme of this year s session and i do hope that by next year we would be in a position to proud ourselves that significant steps towards materializing this vision have been taken. thank you. 16","nicos anastasiades, president of cyprus, while endorsing the general assembly theme and its focus on the founding principles of the united nations, questioned how members come back year after year, and yet are unable to fulfill the basic aims of the united nations charter. he also questioned why security council decisions remain certificates attesting to violations and why international law and agreements are not implemented. he stressed that the cooperation of all must be ensured, specifically victim states suffering from certain issues including, among others, the expansionist ambitions by other states and the promotion of the military industry through formation of conflict in the interest of profit. the enormous equality gap in hunger and nutrition resources around the world is alarming, while child mortality rates are still below acceptable levels. further, the root causes of migration remain unexamined and the implementation of the paris agreement on climate change has been hindered by special interests, he stated. the inability to effectively implement united nations resolutions has led to a lack of credibility and crises such as the forcible displacement of millions, ongoing hunger, human and drug trafficking, and the destruction of cultural heritage. he called on members to meet the shared responsibility of the sustainable development goals and reverse ineffective policies in favor of a more targeted, results‑oriented approach. collective leadership and multilateralism is the only way to eliminate threats to peace and security, he said, again highlighting the importance of effective implementation of united nations decisions. to that end, he pledged support to the secretary‑general in reforming the development pillar and called for further action to address the vulnerability of states to climate change. reform of the peace and security pillar is also of great importance but the former is jeopardized without the latter; the situation in his country is an example of this. given the volatile location of cyprus, his country had reinforced regional ties and established trilateral partnerships with neighboring countries, he continued. those partnerships are a practical expression of multilateralism and are not exclusive. a viable and lasting settlement in cyprus is important not only for the people of cyprus, greece and turkish cypriots. it would also provide a much‑needed environment of stability and peace in the region. only a viable solution in line with european union membership will achieve lasting peace, he emphasized, reiterating his commitment to a solution based on the relevant united nations resolutions and calling on turkey to demonstrate the political determination to reach a settlement."
Czech Republic,"""making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies"" ms president, let me first congratulate you on your election as president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. ms president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, one himdred years since the end of the first world war we find ourselves in the world, where - despite all our efforts - lasting peace has not yet been universally secured and where people are still dying in violent conflicts. the un's raison d'etre is the protection of peace, human rights, justice and social progress. these values are not a western instrument; they form universal ideals for whose accomplishment should all of us, the member states, strive together. we face many challenges to dignity of individuals, global prosperity, and sustainable development, including gender inequauty, youth unemployment, global health threats, climate change, violent extremism, terrorism, forced displacement, or uncontrolled migration. furthermore, multilateralism and the rules based system which benefit everyone and which have long held many of these threats at bay are being increasingly undermined and questioned. one way of how we, as policymakers, can tackle these challenges is realization of the difficult structural and political reforms of the un - to promote shared global responsibility, robust international cooperation, and regaining common values. we all understand the need to reform the un security council to reflect the realities of today's world. unfortunately, in recent years the un security council has been characterized by blocking tactics rather than cooperation. its failure to act on the world's worst atrocities is tangible in several ongoing brutal conflicts, fi-om syria to yemen. secretary-general antdnio guterres has already embarked on the challenging endeavor to reform the un. the czech repubhc fully supports his efforts. making the united nations more effective through much needed reforms in the areas of peace and security, management and development system would truly make the un relevant to all people and help promote peaceful, equitable and sustainable world. as such, we have to endorse the secretarygeneral's work and give his proposals, including their budgetary and financial implications, the strongest possible support. the vital point of the secretary-general's reform agenda is its focus on prevention of conflicts. all of us should tirelessly work to ensure crises are contained before they break out and that post-conflict countries are stabilized in the long term. for an effective prevention, we should adopt a comprehensive approach to peace and security, which treats the climate change as a security problem, while advancing sustainable development and promoting human rights. the czech republic took great pride in having had the honor to hold the one-year presidency of ecosoc in 2017-2018. allow me to thank you all, the member states as well as the secretariat, for excellent cooperation. it was an enlightening experience indeed not only for our presidency team, but also for our entire administration. in the context of sustainable development goals, which are the foundation of our concentrated efforts in promoting sustainable development, the czech republic will continue to champion sdg 16, not only as a follow up of omi ecosoc presidency, but mainly as a cornerstone of the 2030 agenda. we consider peace, justice and functioning institutions our priority and a solid base on which a sustainable future for everyone can be built. in the context of sustainable development, it is also crucial that the united nations seek more synergies between its humanitarian, development and security activities. apart from conflict prevention, special focus should be put on post-conflict stabilization. those efforts should be visible in the field. to achieve this goal, more cooperation among the un agencies is required, as well as broader coordination with and between the un member states. history teaches us that respect for human rights is the best remedy for conflict and violence. efforts towards realization of human rights for all are the best investment in our peaceful and prosperous future. lasting peace and sustainable development cannot be achieved when human rights are abused and violated. and yet, the human rights pillar of the united nations is chronically under-funded and often overlooked. this must change. the un has developed unique tools and fora to promote the realization of human rights. we, the member states, should take full advantage of the un human rights expertise and fully honor the human rights obligations we have taken. today as ever, independent and impartial voices speaking up for hiunan rights are indispensable. one such voice has always been the un high commissioner for human rights and i would like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing high commissioner zeid raad a1 hussein for his excellent job in the office and to wish all the success to his successor michelle bachelet. human rights are deeply rooted in the historical experience of my country. the promotion of human rights - both in bilateral contacts and on the global scene - remains our long-term foreign policy priority. the czech republic is currently running for a seat on the un human rights councu for the term 2019-2021; this candidature has been endorsed by the eastern european group of states. i can assure you that as a council member, the czech republic will spare no effort to contribute to a better enjoyment of human rights for all, everywhere. we stand ready to collaborate in a transparent manner and in good will with all states in all geographical regions as well as with civil society. today, here at the general assembly, i wish to ask you all for your valuable support in several weeks' time at the election to the human rights coimcil. - pause - our efforts to prevent conflicts and instability would not be complete without mentioning denuclearization and fight against terrorism. the czech republic, having its embassy in pyongyang, is deeplyinterested in improving the situation on the korean peninsula. this is why we are following with high expectations both the inter-korean and us-dprk dialog at the highest level. the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the korean peninsula is the only way how to achieve long-lasting peace, security and prosperity on the korean peninsula. we need a resolute and coordinated approach in coimtering proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as we do in fighting terrorism. although isil has been defeated in large territories in syria and iraq, we are aware that it is still active and that there are also other terrorist organizations operating worldwide. it is necessaryto take further steps in the area of international law and finally conclude the comprehensive convention on international terrorism as mentioned by president zeman at this gathering in 2016. we call for an internationally recognized definition of terrorism which will enhance the criminal responsibility of terrorists worldwide and enable us to hold them accountable. this year the czech republic commemorates 50 years since the warsaw pact troops invaded czechoslovakia. the experience of the '68 invasion still resonates strongly not only in the czech republic, as the moment where many lost faith in the promises of the better world preached by the sovietunion. this seemingly historical event however carries lessons still relevant today and echoes in incidents which are still occurring in the world around us: firstly, it is still not a given that all countries including those situated in eastern europe have the right to choose their foreign policy orientation without their sovereignty and territorial integrity threatened. in this context, i would like to recall once more that the annexation of crimea represents a blatant violation of the intemational law. secondly, it should not be forgotten that the use of force is allowed under the un charter only in self-defense and on the basis of chapter vii decision of the un security council. the un is the sole guarantor of intemational peace and security. it is only through collective means and within the mles-based intemational order that peace and security of all our nations can be achieved. thirdly, in cases when states and the intemational community fail in their shared responsibility for the protection of people from atrocities, it is imperative to establish accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights. as such, the czech republic firmly supports intemational criminal justice and, in particular, the international criminal court. we welcome the activation of the icc's jurisdiction over the crime of aggression which we consider to be one of the checks for nonrepetition of this crime in the future. in certain cases, however, icc's jurisdiction is absent. this should not be seen as a loophole for perpetrators of atrocities, as a way to escape accountability. for crimes committed in syria, we are supporting, both politically and by financial contribution, the so called ""triple i mechanism"" - intemational, impartial and independent mechanism to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under intemational law committed in syria since march 2011. the accountability is not only a way to bring justice to those suffering in conflicts, it is also a path towards reconciliation and a cmcial means to prevent atrocities from reoccurring. ladies and gentlemen, while newly independent czech republic was admitted to the united nations 25 years ago, in 1993, this year we also celebrate the centennial of our modem statehood and independence, as czechoslovakia was bom in the cmcible of the first world war in 1918. the founder and first president of my coimtry, tomds garrigue masaryk, rightly posited that states are sustained only by those ideals from which they were bom. the same must be tme about the united nations. we should therefore strive to reinvigorate the founding ideals of this noble organization —only thus can we succeed in fulfilling the topic of its 73""^ session, making it really relevant and helpful to all people. thank you for your kind attention.","jan hamacek, first deputy prime minister of the czech republic, said the united nations purpose — the protection of peace, human rights, justice and social progress — is not a western instrument, but one that forms universal ideals towards which all member states should strive together. multilateralism is increasingly undermined and questioned, he said, calling on policymakers to realize the difficult structural and political reforms required for the united nations to promote shared global responsibility and robust international cooperation and regain common values. in recent years the security council has been characterized by blocking tactics rather than cooperation while failing to act on the world’s worst atrocities in ongoing brutal conflicts from syria to yemen. fully supporting the secretary-general’s proposed reforms and their budgetary requirements, he said the prevention of conflict is a vital point and member states should adopt a comprehensive approach to peace and security which treats climate change as a security problem. the czech republic took great pride in holding the one-year presidency of the economic and social council from 2017-2018 and will continue to champion sustainable development goal 16 as a cornerstone of the 2030 agenda. the united nations must seek more synergies between its humanitarian, development and security activities, he said, calling for special focus on post-conflict stabilization with more cooperation among united nations agencies. despite its importance, the human rights pillar of the united nations is chronically under-funded, he said. human rights are deeply rooted in the historical experience of his country, he went on, noting that the czech republic is currently running for a seat on the united nations human rights council for the 2019-2021 term. he called for member states to support his country’s candidacy. having an embassy in pyongyang, the czech republic has a particular interest in improving the situation on the korean peninsula and is following the inter-korean and united states-democratic people’s republic of korea dialog closely. regarding the fight against terrorism, he said it is necessary to conclude the proposed comprehensive convention on international terrorism and called for an internationally recognized definition of terrorism that will hold perpetrators accountable. it is not a given that all countries, including those situated in eastern europe, have the right to choose their foreign policy orientation without their sovereignty and territorial integrity threatened, he said, calling the annexation of crimea a violation of international law. he noted that the use of force is allowed under the united nations charter only in self-defense, yet the organization is the sole guarantor of international peace and security. therefore, it is only through collective means that those goals may be achieved, he said. he reaffirmed his country’s support of the international criminal court and supported the international, impartial and independent mechanism set up to investigate the most serious crimes in syria."
Côte d’Ivoire,,"daniel kablan duncan, vice-president of côte d’ivoire, said reforming and modernizing the united nations is ever more important at a time when the international community is losing the battle to protect the most vulnerable and promote an inclusive, fair global order. tackling current challenges and uncertainties should prompt member states to embrace the same vision of the central role the united nations plays in crafting a collective response. indeed, the united nations should become an organization for all people, including by restoring its authority to act and ensure respect for its various resolutions. standing at a crossroads, the united nations must meet many expectations, he said, emphasizing the need to reform the security council so it better represents the world. meanwhile, other pressing concerns need urgent attention, he said, highlighting that the fight against climate change can be won only if it is recognized as a threat to peace and security. moreover, a minimum moral and political consensus must guide actions to deal with crises stemming from conflict, war and the spread of disease, he said, underlining the need for all to honor the commitment to the responsibility to protect. focusing on solutions, he said collective security systems will work if the root causes of socio-political difficulties are identified and addressed. human beings must be at the heart of the world’s concerns, as reiterated by recent conferences on the rights of children, women and other groups. efforts must center on narrowing development gaps and in examining inequalities that create to fertile ground for recruitment for terrorist groups. for its part, côte d’ivoire has established a national development plan to address those and other concerns, he said, adding that the government has adopted security-related measures to combat national and regional threats. turning to several national concerns, he said his country is working on addressing the challenge of unregulated migration. calling for a collective drive to resolve the issue, which affected many young people in africa, he viewed the challenges from a development perspective, emphasizing the importance of broadening opportunities for youth. pointing out that 26 per cent of côte d’ivoire’s population are foreigners, he highlighted the benefits of regulating the migration crisis for countries of origin, transit and destination. managing migration well would also benefit the fight against human trafficking. more broadly, the agenda 2063 of the african union demonstrates that the continent can transform itself into the “new frontier” for development, he said, reiterating the need to find collective responses to common challenges."
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,"democratic people's republic of korea permanent mission to the united nations 820 second avenue, 13th floor, new york, n.y 10017 tel: (212)972-3105/3106 fax:(212)972-3154 statement by h.e.ri yong ho,minister for foreign affairs ofthe democratic people's republic ofkorea at the general debate ofthe 73rd session ofthe general assembly ofthe united nations (29 september 2018,new york) madam president, first of all, allow me to congratulate your excellency maria fernanda espinosa garces on your election as the president of the session of the un general assembly. 1 look forward to successful outcome of the unga under your able stewardship. madam president, peace and development is a common desire of our times and it constitutes the main objective of the un defining all its activities. many countries around the world concentrate their efforts on achieving peace and development but such efforts are still faced with serious challenges. during the past 1 year we have been witnessing the overall international relations becoming tense with peace being threatened and development being deterred in many parts of the world due to the power-does-it-all attitude of unilateralism and such a situation requires even more enhanced role of the un. it is the korean peninsula, where the most tangible trend of peace and development was newly created this year. in april this year. comrade kim jong un, the chairman of the state affairs commission of the democratic people's republic of korea (dprk) put forward a new strategic line of concentrating all efforts on the socialist economic construction. since we have sufficiently consolidated national defense capabilities and war deterrence to cope with the nuclear threats against the dprk that have been lasting over several decades, concentrating all efforts on economic construction has come up to us as a historic task. the dprk government's policy line of focusing on the economy requires peaceful environment above an3^hing else. comrade chairman kim jong un conducted energetic summit-level diplomatic activities with a firm determination to turn the korean peninsula into a land of peace free of both nuclear weapons and nuclear threats; and made an important breakthrough in improving the north-south relations and the dprk-u.s. relations and in revitalizing the friendly and cooperative relations with neighboring countries and thus made a turning point for dramatic easing oftension in the korean peninsula. as much as we have achieved in easing of tension in the korean peninsula and its region, the peace and security of the region will be consolidated and this will lead to the world peace and security, to the benefits of all the member states of the un in other words. the fact that representatives of numerous countries have been unanimous in supporting and welcoming the current direction of the developments in the korean peninsula at this platform clearly shows that the dprk government's strategic choice and its sincere efforts to pursue that choice fully concur with the common interest and desire of the international community. madam president, the key to consolidating the peace and security in the korean peninsula is to thoroughly implement the dprk-u.s. joint statement adopted in june at the historic dprk-u.s.summit in singapore. the dprk-u.s. joint statement contains all principled issues regarding eventual solutions of the issues in the korean peninsula such as terminating decades-long hostility between the two countries and establishing new dprk-u.s. relations, building solid peace regime on the korean peninsula, realizing complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula and humanitarian work between the two countries. once the dprk-u.s. joint statement is implemented, the current trend towards detente will turn into durable peace and the complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula will also be achieved and the korean peninsula, the hottest spot in the globe, will become the cradle of peace and prosperity that contributes to security in asia and the rest of the world. the dprk government's commitment to thorough implementation of the dprk-u.s. joint statement is unwavering. the primary task for effectively implementing the dprk-u.s. joint statement should be bringing down the barrier of mistrust between the two countries which has existed for several decades; and to this end, the dprk and the u.s. should spend many efforts to building trust above all. all the past process for the implementation of previous agreements from various dialogs and negotiations between the dprk and the u.s. ended in failure because the mistrust between the two was not sufficiently removed resulting in lack of confidence. it is our position that the denuclearization of the korean peninsula should also be realized along with building peace regime under the principle of simultaneous actions, step by step,starting with what we can do and giving priority to trust-building. out of the desire and resolute determination to successfully implement the dprk-u.s. joint statement, the dprk government gives particular attention to trust-building and is pouring primary efforts to this. even before the dprk-u.s. summit, the dprk government took significant good-will measures such as stopping nuclear and icbm tests, dismantling the nuclear test site in a transparent manner and affirming not to transfer nuclear weapons and nuclear technology under any circumstances and it continues to put in efforts to trust-building. however, we do not see any corresponding response from the u.s. on the contrary, instead of addressing our concern for the absence of peace regime in the korean peninsula, the u.s. insists on the ""denuclearization-first"" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting the ""declaration of the end of war"". the perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe-dream of the people who are ignorant about us. but the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust. the reason behind the recent deadlock is because the u.s. relies on coercive methods which are lethal to trust-building. the recent dramatic improvement of the north-south relations and the atmosphere of cooperation clearly show how decisive the role of trust-building can be. in less than 5 months, the leaders of the north and the south met 3 times and through their meetings and talks they have been building trust in each other enough for solving the various issues in the north-south relations in a constructive manner and the tangible results are shown in reality. as demonstrated by the ""september pyongyang joint declaration"" that was jointly announced by the leaders of the north and the south on september 19, this year the dialogs between the north and south in many areas including the fields of politics, military, humanitarian work, sports, culture and economic cooperation are very active and atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation has been high like never before and many noteworthy outcomes are being made one after another enjoying the support and welcome by the entire korean nation and the international community. if the party to this issue of denuclearization were south korea and not the u.s., the denuclearization of the korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock. this is why we give great importance to building confidence between the dprk and the u.s. for the implementation ofthe joint statement. without any trust in the u.s. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first. the dprk government's commitment to the denuclearization is solid and firm. however,it is only possible if the u.s. secures our sufficient trust towards the u.s. madam president, there are pessimistic views towards the implementation of the dprk-u.s. joint statement inside the u.s., and that is not because there is any flaw in the joint statement but because of the u.s. domestic politics. those in the political opposition in the u.s. make it their daily business to slander the dprk claiming that we cannot be trusted with the sole purpose of attacking their political opponent and they are enforcing the administration to make unreasonable unilateral demand to our side thereby impeding the smooth progress of the dialog and negotiations. creating mistrust towards the dialog partner while only relying on coercive method is not helpful at all in building trust; on the contrary it only increases mistrust. talking about reasons for distrusting each other, we have far more reasons to distrust the u.s. the u.s. possessed nuclear weapons earlier than we did and the u.s. is the only country that actually used them in real war. from the very first day of our republic 70 years ago the u.s. has exercised hostile policy against our country and put complete economic blockade against our country making sure that the u.s. enterprises cannot even trade a single screw nail with our country. we did not even throw a pebble stone at the u.s. soil but during the korean war the u.s. threatened to drop tens of atomic bombs in our country, and even after that the u.s. kept bringing in strategic nuclear arsenals at our door steps. if the both countries harbor mistrust towards each other, being obsessed with the past, then the recent dprk-u.s. joint statement cannot escape the same fate of failure as all the previous agreements between the two countries. one part of the spirit of the dprk-u.s. summit in singapore is to free ourselves of old conventional way and trying a completely new way of solving the issues. at this critical juncture, the u.s. should make a foresighted judgment that faithful fulfillment of the commitment it made in singapore will, in the end, be in the best national interest of the u.s. and should maintain new method for solving the dprk-u.s. relations. only then there will be a positive prospect for the dprk-u.s. joint statement. if the dprk-u.s. joint statement becomes a victim of the domestic politics of the u.s., then the greatest victim of the subsequent unpredictable consequences will be the u.s. itself as a whole. solving the dprk-u.s. relations and issues in the korean peninsula is the key topic in achieving theme of this session: ""making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies"". our new policy line of concentrating all efforts on the economic construction is the right political choice not only in improving our people's life but also in realizing the common desire of the people around the world aspiring after peace and development. the international society should support and encourage our efforts to focus on the economic construction in response to the bold decisions and good-will measures we have taken for the easing of tension and maintaining durable peace in the korean peninsula. the implementation of the dprk-u.s. joint statement is a shared responsibility of the dprk and the u.s.; at the same time the un also has a role to play in it. the un security council that was once so eager to express ""concern"" to the tense situation in the korean peninsula keeps silence even now about the precious momentum for peace in the korean peninsula which has been achieved this year; this cannot be said as normal in any way. the unsc poured down on us numerous ""sanctions resolutions"" making issue of our nuclear tests and rocket test launches. but even today, when one whole year has passed since such tests have been stopped, even a word in those ""resolutions"" remains unchanged to say nothing about being totally removed or eased. worse still, the unsc is taking very concerning stand by rejecting the proposal by some of its member states to issue presidential statement that welcomes the dprk-u.s. summit and the joint statement. the ""un command"" in south korea even showed alarming signs of hindering the implementation of the panmunjom declaration between the north and south. as for the ""un command"",it is merely a ""command of allied forces"" beyond the control of the un that only obeys the orders of the u.s., but the problem is that it is still misusing the sacred name of the un. based on the mission of the un as defined in the un charter, the un and especially the unsc have the responsibility and duty to support and welcome the developments that are helpful in ensuring international peace and security. the un should really apply the theme of this session: ""making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities"" to its actual activities and hence get rid of the stigma that""unsc equals u.s."" as early as possible. thank you.","ri yong ho, minister for foreign affairs of the democratic people’s republic of korea, noted that peace, threatened around the world, was being newly created on the korean peninsula. in april this year, comrade kim jong un, chairman of the state affairs commission of his country, put forward a new strategy concentrating all efforts on the socialist economic reconstruction. because his country has sufficiently consolidated national defense capabilities, the government is turning to economic construction and that requires a peaceful environment. comrade chairman kim jong un conducted energetic summit‑level diplomatic activities with a firm determination to turn the korean peninsula into a land of peace free to both nuclear weapons and threats, thus making an important breakthrough in improving north‑south relations and relations between the democratic people’s republic of korea and the united states. the key to consolidating peace and security in the korean peninsula is to thoroughly implement the joint statement adopted in june at the historic summit in singapore, he stressed. that statement contains all issues regarding solutions such as terminating the decades‑long hostility between the two countries and establishing new relations between the democratic people’s republic of korea and the united states aimed at building a solid peace regime on the peninsula while realizing its complete denuclearization. once it is implemented, and concerted efforts are made by all stakeholders at bringing down the barriers of mistrust and rebuilding trust, the current trend towards détente will turn into durable peace. “the korean peninsula, the hottest spot in the globe, will become the cradle of peace and prosperity,” he stated. even before that summit, his government took significant goodwill measures such as stopping nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site in a transparent manner and affirming not to transfer nuclear weapons and technology under any circumstances, he continued. “however, we do not see any corresponding response from the united states,” he said, noting its insistence on denuclearization‑first, as well as its increases to the level of pressure by sanctions. “the perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream,” he said, adding that the recent deadlock is because the united states relies on coercive methods that are lethal to trust‑building. in less than five months, the leaders of the democratic people’s republic of korea and the republic of korea met three times and through their meetings and talks, they have been building trust in each other, he pointed out. the dialogs in many areas, including politics, military, humanitarian work and sports are very active, and the atmosphere of reconciliation has been high like never before. if the party to the denuclearization issue had been the republic of korea and not the united states, the denuclearization of the korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock. the united states, which possessed nuclear weapons before his country did, is the only country that used them in war. “we did not even throw a pebble stone at the united states soil during the korean war,” he said, but the united states threatened to drop atomic bombs in his country and kept bringing in strategic nuclear arsenals to its doorsteps. at this critical juncture, he added, the united states should make a foresighted judgment that implementing the commitment made in singapore will be in its best national interests. turning to his government’s new policy line of concentrating all efforts on economic construction, he called it the right political choice, not only in improving people’s lives in the country but also in realizing the common desire of people around the world for peace. calling on the international community to support his country, he added that the united nations has a role to play in the implementation of the democratic people’s republic of korea‑united states joint statement. the security council that was once so eager to express “concern” about the tense situation in the korean peninsula now keeps silent about the precious momentum for peace there. worse still, the council is rejecting the proposal by some of its member states to issue a presidential statement that welcomes the summit and the statement, he said, calling on the united nations to support developments that are helpful in ensuring international peace."
Democratic Republic of the Congo,,"joseph kabila kabange, president of the democratic republic of the congo, first providing a snapshot of the security situation in his country over the past year, noted significant improvements in the central region and successful efforts in the north-east in containing terrorist attacks. peace has been consolidated, with displaced families returning to their homes, yet security challenges remain only in the north-east region in the face of terrorist activities, a threat affecting other countries in the region and across the world. while addressing that threat and boosting security ahead of the forthcoming elections, he elaborated on recent progress on the political landscape. commending efforts to reach a consensus on the election process and the publication of an electoral calendar, he reaffirmed the irreversible decision to hold elections before the end of 2018 despite enormous challenges in many areas. moreover, all steps are being taken to guarantee peaceful, credible elections based on the country’s vision of consolidating the political and economic stability needed for further progress. turning to the session’s theme, he called on each member state to assess its contribution to the universal whole and to protect the values upon which the united nations is based. given emerging development “hubs” and looming threats, some with global consequences, the organization must adapt to rise to those challenges. equally important is preserving the foundations of a global balance. concerned that some states act in contravention with the organization’s principles, he said the democratic republic of the congo condemned any attempts at interfering in its forthcoming elections. voicing support for a return to the foundations of democracy and human rights, he said his country is proud to share its experience as a nation, having joined both regional and international forums. while the democratic republic of the congo has a long road ahead, he emphasized that the united nations can foster the growth of sustainable societies, which in turn depends on galvanizing the necessary will and honoring promises often made, but rarely kept. sharing a regional concern, he highlighted that african states had been, for 15 years, calling for better representation on the security council. africa wants its voice to be heard in terms of the maintenance of peace and security, he said, underlining that the call is particularly urgent since most united nations peacekeeping operations take place on the continent. regarding the peacekeeping operation currently operating in the democratic republic of the congo, he reiterated a call for the withdrawal of the multilateral force. the democratic republic of the congo had, years ago, been relegated as a “failed state”, he said, adding that his country has overcome many obstacles on the path to peace. while the challenges ahead are great, his country will work hard to continue on that path and will stand by the united nations. however, member states must work for a stronger organization, which represents the preservation of humanity."
Denmark,"permanent mission of denmark to the united nations statement by h.e. ulla t0rna5s, minister for development cooperation of denmark statement by denmark 73rd session of the general assembly of the united nations general debate 28 september 2018 new york friday, 28 september 2018 e-mail: n3 mis@um.dk htt :/ / fnnewyork.um.dk 1 madam president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, at the outset, allow me to join others in paying tribute to the memory of the late kofi annan. a true world leader and a firm believer in the strength of this organization. madam president, seventy years ago, this general assembly adopted the first global human rights charter - the universal declaration of human rights. the declaration codified the most basic principles of human dignity - emphasizing that we are all equal. we committed ourselves to an international order where rights and freedoms could be fully realized. seventy years ago, we knew that international cooperation was the only way to protect our populations. and through this organization, we have delivered remarkable results. still, the foundation on which this organization is built has perhaps never been under more pressure than today. the very principle of multilateralism is being questioned. doubt is being cast on the frameworks that protect human rights, ensure free trade and promote global development. insufficient action is being taken on global problems like climate change, poverty, migration, terrorism and violent extremism. 2 madam president, to denmark, the path forward is clear: global challenges need global solutions. and to this end, we need a strong united nations with its unique legitimacy and its universal membership. a united nations that delivers on its full potential. denmark remains committed to the secretary-general's reform agenda. this year, we open the general assembly with three agreed tracks for reform. denmark had the honor together with algeria to facilitate the negotiations on development system reform. we are proud of the result, and we will continue to play a constructive role in the important implementation ahead. denmark intends - for instance - to contribute more than 10 million us dollar to support the establishment of the new resident coordinator system and we encourage others to follow suit. member states have given their clear voice of support. now the reforms must be turned into reality. the world expects a new and more streamlined un to emerge. all parts of the un must embrace this opportunity to change and create real improvements to the benefit of the people. madam president, as member states, we also have to re-invest in the un and take responsibility for our multilateral cooperation and the rule-based international order. that is exactly why denmark is running for a seat on the human rights council for the term 2019 to 2021. 3 if elected, we will promote the rights and equal opportunities of women; continue our longstanding fight against torture; protect the rights of indigenous peoples; and encourage freedom of religion or belief. this has to be done without discrimination on any grounds, including sexual orientation and gender identity. that is the danish dna. and the dna of the united nations. madam president, in several parts of the world, gender equality is but a distant hope. women s rights are under increasing pressure. we cannot accept this. we must stand up and challenge this. women must unfold their potential - without question - to the benefit of all. we must ensure that she decides. gender equality and equal opportunities is not only a fundamental human right. it is a precondition. for development, peace and prosperity in any country, anywhere in the world. madam president, the 2030 agenda and the paris agreement on climate change set out a strong global vision for achieving a more sustainable planet. denmark is committed to this common vision. for more than 40 consecutive years, we have proudly delivered on the u target on providing 0.7 per cent of gni in official development assistance. sadly, we are in a group that has far too few members. 4 1 while oda is crucial to ensure global development, we need the involvement of all actors, especially the private sector, civil society and local authorities. we need to give young people a seat at the table. to ensure that development is not just for young people - but with and by young people. this is why denmark was the first country to announce a contribution to the secretary-general s new youth strategy, vision 2030 . we congratulate the un and all young people on this strategy and look forward to seeing it in action. member states and the un system need to adapt to the world around us and embrace and use new technologies. we need the innovative ideas, the finance and the expertise that only the private sector can bring to the table. in short, to reach the sdgs over the next 12 years, we need to rethink the way we do business here. the clock is ticking. that is one of the reasons why denmark - together with our partners - launched the initiative partnering for green growth and the global goals 2030 - the p4g. with p4g, we are bringing together major companies, cities, civil society, think tanks and governments to boost and create partnerships for a greener tomorrow. in october, denmark will host a high-level p4g summit in copenhagen to forge and accelerate such partnerships. madam president, 5 education is the foundation for knowledge and harnessing the technologies and opportunities of tomorrow. and when it comes to education we can and must do better. much better. globally, 130 million girls do not go to school. in crisis situations, girls are 2.5 times more likely to be out-of-school than boys. and girls are at much greater risk of being victims of sexual abuse and exploitation, of early child marriage and childbirth. just think, in parts of the world, girls as low as nine years old are being forced to marry adult men. this is just not acceptable. we must let girls be girls, nc brides. education is a beacon of hope for these girls. that is why denmark is now the biggest contributor to education cannot wait. that is why denmark will spend almost 70 million us dollars next year on education in developing countries. because denmark will leave no girl behind. madam president, displacement and unsafe and irregular migration poses a significant global challenge that requires determined efforts at all levels. denmark welcomes the finalization of negotiations in july of a global compact for migration. the compact establishes a global framework for common action. the compact presents a much-needed path to manage irregular migration in a safe and orderly manner and to curb irregular migration, including through 6 facilitation of return. all with respect for human rights and the principle of state sovereignty at its core. we also welcome the agreement on the global compact on refugees. denmark is per capita one of the world s largest humanitarian donors. a key focus of ours is to help refugees and internally displaced persons to a life in safety and dignity. by ensuring close coordination between our humanitarian and development aid, denmark is helping to build the foundation for lasting solutions and a safe return when the time is right. the horrors in syria, yemen and elsewhere tell the grim story of why humanitarian efforts are so strongly needed. the conflict in syria continues in its 8th year. so many have already experienced unspeakable suffering, evil and atrocities. three million people have been at the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe in idlib. this tragedy in syria cannot go on. madam president, earlier this week, member states honored nelson mandela. in a fitting celebration of an iconic proponent for peace, leaders from across the world underscored the importance of a joint com itment to build a peaceful and prosperous world. 7 as we push for reforms and strengthen our multilateral institutions, we have to acknowledge the interconnectedness of today s global challenges. we need integrated and shared approaches to stabilization, peacebuilding and conflict prevention. that is why denmark has been a strong supporter of the un peacebuilding fund. we are proud to step up our commitment with a new contribution to the fund of 15 million us dollars over the coming three years. madam president, the world is witnessing armed conflicts that could have been prevented or stopped years ago. too many states are failing their responsibility to protect their own populations against the most horrific crimes. denmark will continue to insist on accountability for the most appalling crimes. such crimes must never go unpunished and the victims deserve justice. this year, we mark the 20th anniversary of the international criminal court. a landmark achievement to ensure accountability and justice. the recent report of the fact finding mission on myanmar clearly underlines the need for accountability in relation to the rohingya crisis. at the same time, we must not forget the enormous need for humanitarian assistance and development aid. 8 i am happy to announce that denmark will provide additional 7 million us dollars for an extraordinary humanitarian response to the crisis. this comes on top of the 46 million us dollars already provided since 2017. denmark is also supporting the office of the secretary-general s special envoy to myanmar. madam president, the situation on the korean peninsula is a strong reminder of what is at stake. denmark fully supports the continuous efforts by south korea and the united states to seek a diplomatic solution with the north korean regime. now, north korea must take concrete steps towards complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. until then, sanctions and international pressure must remain firmly in place. madam president, the problems facing the world are dire. we will only be successful if we act together. multilateralism and cooperation must be the foundation. the task may seem impossible, but we have done it before. with the united nations, we have fostered an international order - a strong set of co o values, rules and goals. 9 people around the world demand solutions. the un cannot let them down. now is the time for us to reform and rebuild this institution. thank you. 10","ulla tørnæs, minister for development cooperation of denmark, said the world needs a strong united nations that delivers on its full potential. she called for the secretary‑general’s reform agenda to be turned into reality. all parts of the organization must embrace the opportunity to change. member states must reinvest in the united nations and take responsibility for multilateral cooperation and rule‑based international order, she said, noting denmark’s candidature for a seat on the human rights council for the 2019‑2021 term. gender equality is but a distant hope in several parts of the world and women’s rights are under increasing pressure everywhere, she said. “we cannot accept this. we must stand up and challenge this,” she said, emphasizing that gender equality and equal opportunities are not only fundamental rights, but preconditions for development, peace and prosperity everywhere in the world. she underscored denmark’s commitment to the 2030 agenda and the paris agreement, emphasizing that for more than 40 years it has delivered on the united nations target of providing 0.7 per cent of gross national income in official development assistance (oda). “sadly, we are in a group that has too few members,” she said. she stressed the role to be played by young people, as well as the importance of education for girls. she welcomed the finalization of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, as well as the global compact on refugees, and described the horrors in syria, yemen and elsewhere as examples of why humanitarian efforts are so strongly needed. denmark insists on accountability for the most appalling crimes in conflict situations, she said. the report of the independent international fact‑finding mission on myanmar underlined the need for accountability vis‑à‑vis the rohingya crisis alongside the enormous need for humanitarian and development assistance. in that regard, she announced an additional $7 million in extraordinary humanitarian assistance to that crisis, on top of the $46 million already provided since 2017. she went to call on the democratic people’s republic of korea to take concrete steps towards denuclearization. until then, sanctions and international pressure must continue, she said."
Djibouti,,"mahmoud ali youssouf, minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation of djibouti, said that although there is a consensus for united nations reforms, an inertia continues to hinder them. on the international scene, major upheaval is a significant cause of concern. the number of people leaving their countries is growing, and this migratory flow has contributed to bitter political debate in many northern countries which may prevent the international community from building a better world. the crisis in multilateralism is a consequence of this, contradicting the collaborative notion of “i am someone else”. he welcomed that in response to this, the international community has mobilized to adopt reforms initiated by the security-general for development, management, and peace and security architecture. hailing the finalization of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, he added that finalizing the global compact for refugees will be an important development. if the united nations cannot solve the crises that create refugees, it must meet their needs. while the sustainable development goals require the collection of useful data, he underscored that the 2030 agenda depends not only on innovative finance strategies, but that commitments already made are honored. the greatest threat to this is worldwide conflict and violence, with the expansion of terrorism calling for a response that differs from conventional peacekeeping operations and diplomacy. however, the horn of africa has witnessed positive developments. highlighting the thaw in relations between ethiopia and eritrea as the inauguration of a new age of relations between them, he said the region had felt immediate consequences. the presidents of djibouti and eritrea recently met and agreed to open a new chapter between “these two brother countries” and continue dialog on remaining issues. he expressed hope that the recent peace deal in south sudan will be successful, as the people there have greatly suffered. somalia is building robust governing institutions, but it was necessary to combat those opposing progress, like al-shabaab. paying tribute to the troops of amisom, he said support for somali forces is vital for the handover of security responsibilities. turning to the issue of palestine, he said there is no alternative to the two-state solution, and that the plight of palestinian refugees calls upon all our consciences. citing the “ethnic cleansing” of the rohingya people, he said the international community must put pressure on the government of myanmar to resolve the crisis. the united nations plays a key role in peace and international cooperation, and it is therefore incumbent upon everyone to support it. djibouti looks forward to building a world of greater security and prosperity."
Dominica,"commonwealth of domi ica address by hon. francine baron minister for foreign and caricom affairs of the commonwealth of dominica on the occasion of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly september 29, 2018 united nations, new york i secretary general of the united nations, president of the general assembly distinguished heads of delegations, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: madam president, i congratulate you on your appointment and my delegation extends best wishes to you for a productive tenure, as you seek to direct the affairs of this important institution, in the interest of humanity. madam president: there are few moments in the history of a nation, that captures the resilience, fortitude and strength of its people. for us that moment came on september 18, last year, when hurricane maria unleashed its fury of 180 miles per-hour winds that, brought dominica to its knees. immediately after the raging winds and the torrential down pours subsided, our people, raised their battered and wounded selves and began the daunting task of search and rescue, clearing roadways and quickly moved thereafter into a rebuilding mode. madam president: i am proud to stand here, one year later, representing a people who have fought against adversity from that day, to attain some form of normalcy in their lives. i am proud to be representing students who spent months away from classrooms, who endured the inconvenience of no electricity no internet and the disruption of living in shelters, but who attained some of the highest scores, on the recently concluded caribbean secondary school examinations. 2 i am proud to stand here representing farmers, who have gone back to their fields and are now harvesting fresh produce to feed our people and for export. i applaud dominicans far and wide for being part of the relief efforts and the rebuilding process, but i salute in particular those at home, who walked for miles every day, up, down, and across the island, to be of service. who worked countless hours to save lives, to provide essential services and to deliver vital supplies to those in need. hurricane maria wreaked havoc on dominica, but the world must be told of the strength of dominicans, our tenacity and our determination as a people. the efforts of our people were keenly matched by the outpouring of support that we received from members of this un family. from our brothers and sisters in the caribbean region, to our international partners and friends. ordinary men and women across the globe reached out to us, to lend a helping hand. as we speak scores of volunteers are on the ground, helping with the rebuilding efforts. the tremendous support that we have received from regional response agencies and international organizations, both within and outside the un system, and institutions like the world bank, all of these efforts have contributed significantly to the progress that we have made thus far. we cannot on this occasion single out those many persons, countries and organizations, that reached out to us, but the people of dominica are eternally grateful, to all of you for standing with us in our darkest hour. thank you all. 3 madam president, a few days following the passage of hurricane maria, our prime minister, honorable roosevelt skerrit, stood before this august body and sounded a call for action. he called for the world to wake up and take note, that the war of climate change, had come to our shores. he echoed a call to all countries big and small; developed and developing, to come together to save our planet. one year later, where are we? what have we done? what have we achieved? among and around us are many who still deny the reality of climate change. we have not, as a global community, agreed upon a plan for implementation of the commitments made in paris at cop21. additionally, we have not mobilized the resources to capitalize the 100 billion dollars per year, which was agreed upon, to assist the most vulnerable, to adapt and mitigate against the harmful effects of climate change. while we have failed to live up to these commitments, arctic ice shelves continue to melt at an alarming rate. the oceans continue to get warmer; hurricanes and storms continue to develop and threaten our countries, drought becomes more severe and flooding more pronounced. climate change is therefore the global responsibility of our time. i do not even for a brief moment say this lightly. how could i, standing here, in this forum that appeals to our universal humanity? madam president: we live in a world in which too many children go hungry night after night. a world in which light arms and small weapons continue to infiltrate our most vulnerable societies. a world in 4 which non-communicable diseases account for so many preventable deaths. yes! i agree! poverty, inequality and violence are shared responsibilities, too; but their modem-d y manifestations are wrapped up in climate change. climate change arises from activities that support and reflect inequalities, nd lways, it is the oor who suffer most. it is the oor whose lands are impacted by severe droughts and flooding, whose homes are destroyed and loved ones perish. it is the poor who have the least capacity to escape the heavy burdens, of poverty, disease, and death. madam president: much violence stems directly from climate-change induced scarcity of things, like water, or productive lands. climate change is the main symptom of our world s broken economy, society and humanity. distinguished delegates: this is precisely the issues for which we have assembled our united nations. let this not be just another moment, to simply sharpen the rhetoric or to speak merely of redoubling current efforts. we have done that too many times before - yet watched climate change ravage on, regardless. while we pontificate and engage in a perpetual debate, climate change will march on, laying waste to our forests and fields, whipping up the fury of angry winds and punishing rains, wrecking lives and livelihoods. 5 it is no secret that the lack of motivation by some countries to take the required actions, is rooted in this economic truth: that those who gain most from the activities that create climate chan e, remain the most removed from its dire consequences. since climate change is the result of an economic calculus, that will keep pushing global destruction further and further along, it must be accepted as the responsibility of our time. one we must put our collective efforts behind to arrest. madam president: it was only after prime minister skeritt left this hall last year, that the international experts completed the post disaster needs assessment for dominica. their conclusions disclosed that a single hurricane, in a few hours, caused loss and damage equivalent to 226% of our country s gdp. a mere two years prior, a tropical storm, had wiped out the equivalent of 90% of our gdp. the cost of building back better, of building a resilient nation, comes with a price tag far in excess of what small developing states, like dominica, are able to meet singlehandedly. this is exacerbated by the debilitating impact these events have on economic activities, depriving the country of much needed revenue at a critical time. as i speak to you this minute, dangerous storms are gathering in the western atlantic. as climate change warms the seas and feeds the rainstorms, the risk of future loss and damage grow. yet, the price of production and consumption of goods that contribute to climate change, is not set to compensate us for our losses and damages, resulting from it. 6 madam president: from the perspective of our s ared destiny, these goods will be over-produced and over-consumed. climate change is not a freak of nature. it is as man-made, as power and greed. the polluter pays is an accepted principle - a golden nexus of morality, economics and environmental policy. the ‘polluter pays’ is tried and tested at the national level. but, alas, on the international level, it is the victim who pays. consider the insurance model championed by many industrialized countries and international agencies, as the solution to climate change. island states on the front line are being asked to take out additional insurance against the losses and damage, which are the direct results of a change in climate caused by others. this is asking the victim to pay by installment. the insane equivalent would be the arsonist saying to you, that instead of trying to stop him setting fire to your house, you should take on fire insurance. distinguished delegates: if our principal response to man-made climate change, is to make it easier for the victims to foot the bill, then the march of climate change will press on unimpeded. this, therefore, is untenable, indefensible and downright unacceptable. madame president: 7 the game changer would be, establishing a different kind of insurance, especially for vulnerable and at-risk countries like ours, that pays out quickly to the victims of climate disasters. fairness requires that this insurance mechanism must be funded by those who have contributed most to climate change. additionally, this needs to be scaled up as a matter of urgency. we have a caribbean risk insurance fund which paid out funds vital for the immediate relief efforts, but it does not have the capacity to insure against loss and damage. today, i wish to propose that the united nations oversee a ‘climate loss nd damage insurance fund, where premiums are paid by those who have contributed most and continue to contribute to climate change and that payouts go quickly to those who suffer the direct consequences of climate disasters, once independently declared to be such. madam president: ending the inequality that separates those who gain and those who lose will remove the fuel lines of climate change. this is what an international community serious about halting climate change, must do. madam president: we urge you to do this and we hope your feet are swift. because we can no longer afford to wait. our people needed sanctuary and safety yesterday, not tomorrow. in the past twelve months, while contending with the sheer hard graft of relief and early recovery efforts, housing the vulnerable 8 nd restoring essential services, dominica instituted a plan to make it the first clim te resilient nation in the world. we have drafted legislation to establish the climate resilience executing agency of dominica, (cread) which will deliver the projects that will achieve this goal. we have recruited its leadership and identified a billion dollars worth of critical rojects to compliment this plan. we ha e rolled u our sleeves and started work. our plan is based around designing super-resilient networks, water-proofing our economy and building resilient communities. as we have critically examined the core of what it takes to be resilient, we have found that what looked insurmountable from a distance, is not so daunting up close. distinguished delegates: this realization has buoyed up our confidence and re-energized every dominican. by the grace of god, therefore, and with the continued support of our partners in the global community, we will become the first climate resilient nation in the world. we encourage other vulnerable small island states, to embark on building resilience to climate change. the costs, however, are above and beyond the capacity of small states. support from the international organizations and member states, with the requisite technical expertise and financial resources is critical. the role of the un is therefore central in coordinating and mobilizing resources. the creation of a special international climate change resilience facility, to provide technical and financial resources, should be given most urgent attention. the existing global economic and development architecture must facilitate this new development paradigm. 9 official development assistance (oda) must be re-engineered to take into account the vulnerability of small island states and the imperative of building resilience to climate change. the international financial institutions (ifis) must rethink the classification of debt and the terms and conditions of debt financing, for essential services and vital infrastructure. while we battle the effects of climate change, we are supremely conscious that there are many other challenges confronting our region and indeed the wider world. two emerging global problems brought on by climate change is that of climate migration and disaster re ugees. although not yet full blown, some countries that act as safe havens have begun to feel the pressures. this further underscores, that the emerging problems brought on by the effects of climate change, require urgent global attention. dominica calls on these united nations, to begin the discourse on both climate migration and disaster refugees, while it is still early. madam president; we champion our region as a zone of peace. we remain extremely concerned about the situation in our sister countries of venezuela and nicaragua. we call for support for a process of dialog, to achieve a peaceful resolution, for the benefit of the citizens of those nations, while respecting and observing the time honored international norms, of respect for sovereignty and the non¬ interference in the internal affairs of other nations. madam president: over many years, this body has debated resolutions to end the economic and financial blockade of our sister country cuba. we 10 have long established that maintaining this trade embargo can only have a negative impact on our brothers and sisters in cuba. notwithstanding its limitations, the republic of cuba has come to the aid of so many around the world, particularly in the areas of healthcare and education and sometimes in the most trying of circumstances. we add our voice once again to the chorus of voices calling for an end to this blockade. dominica is in support of a united nations, where young people, who account for over forty-percent of the world s po ulation, can pursue a global youth agenda, with opportunities to dialog on key issues that impact their development. similarly, we congratulate the stakeholder group of persons with disabilities and other non-state actors for efforts at advancing opportunities for persons with disabilities, to ensure they remain part of the united nations agenda. madam president, distinguished colleagues, if we keep looking down at our feet, we will die of sorrow. we choose to look up. we move forward knowing we are not alone on this challenging journey. twelve months ago, the international community heard our cry and have stood with us. this has made us stronger and more motivated. to those who came,, we thank you and urge you to stay the course over these next few years. let us set the example for a better future for all mankind. let history record what we did and not what we said. what efforts we made to end the march of climate change globally, and to reduce our vulnerabilities locally. we, together, must grasp this moment. thank you and god bless these united nations! 12","francine baron, minister for foreign and caribbean community (caricom) affairs of dominica, said that there are moments in the history of a nation that captured its resilience. she noted that for dominica, the moment came last year, when hurricane maria unleashed its fury of 180 miles per hour winds that brought the country to its knees. immediately after, citizens began the daunting task of search and rescue, clearing roadways, and rebuilding. applauding dominicans far and wide for being part of the relief efforts, as well as members of the united nations family, she thanked all who helped. “let this not be another moment to simply sharpen the rhetoric or to speak merely of redoubling current efforts,” she said. “we have done that too many times before — yet watched climate change ravage on, regardless.” it is no secret that the lack of motivation by some countries is rooted in the fact that those who gain most from the activities that create climate change remain most removed from its dire consequences. “since climate change is the result of an economic calculus that will keep pushing global destruction further and further along, it must be accepted as the responsibility of our time,” she said, calling for collective efforts to stop it. within a few hours, hurricane maria caused damage equivalent to 226 per cent of dominica’s gdp. two years earlier, a tropical storm had wiped out 90 per cent of the gdp. the cost of building back better — of building a more resilient nation — comes with a price more than developing states can meet singlehandedly. the price of consumption and production of goods that contribute to climate change does not compensate for the losses. the “polluter pays” is an accepted principle and a golden nexus of morality, economics and environmental policy. on an international level, it is the victim who pays. the insurance model championed by many industrialized countries and international agencies as a solution to climate change asks island states on the front line to take out additional insurance against loss and damage, which are the direct results of a change in climate caused by others. “this is asking the victim to pay by installment. this insane equivalent would be the arsonist saying to you that instead of trying to stop him setting fire to your house, you should take on fire insurance,” she said, adding that the game changer would be to establish a different kind of insurance, especially for vulnerable countries, that pays out quickly to the victims of climate disasters. she proposed the united nations oversee a “climate loss and damage insurance fund” where premiums are paid by those who have contributed most and continue to contribute to climate change. she noted dominica’s response to climate change, instituting a plan to make it the first climate resilient nation in the world. dominica has drafted legislation to establish the climate resilience executing agency of dominica and has identified $1 billion of critical projects. the plan is based around designing super-resilient networks, water-proofing the economy, and building resilient communities. the role of the united nations is central to mobilizing resources, she noted, adding that official development assistance (oda) must be re-engineered to take into account vulnerability."
Dominican Republic,"permanent mission of the dominican republic to the united nations statement by h. e. danilo medina sanchez president of the dominican republic at the plenary of the 73rd general assembly of the united nations new york, september 25,2018 speech by his excellency, president of the dominican republic, danilo medina, at the seventy-third regular session of the general assembly of the united nations september 25 2018 your excellency mrs. marfa fernanda espinosa garc4s, president of the seventy-third regular session of the general assembly of the united nations; your excellency antonio guterres, secretary general of the un; sirs heads of state and governments; gentlemen heads of delegations; sirs ministers; ladles and gentlemen; first of all, allow me to congratulate ambassador maria fernanda espinosa garces, for her election as president of this general assembly and wish her every possible success. for me it is a great honor to be able to address you again as president of the dominican republic. this is a special occasion for our country, because next year the dominican republic will be part, for the first time, of the security council of the united nations, as a non-permanent member. that is why 1want to start by thanking, on behalf of the dominican people and myself, the member countries of the un for the support received to be part of the security council. in particular, i would like to thank the members of the group of countries of latin america and the caribbean, grulac, for the trust placed in us. our purpose during this period will be to contribute a latin american and caribbean voice to one of the premier instances for maintaining global peace. naturally, from now, we commit ourselves to enforcing, both in the security council and in this assembly, the same unbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. respect for human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity will therefore be the beacon we will follow to guide our work in the security council. we will do everything possible to honor the trust placed in us, being fully aware that stability and safety are priority objectives but also fragile, that must be preserved and to which advance is made step-by-step, day-byday. 2 we are clear that a space dealing with issues that can alter the history and destiny of millions of people has no room for easy and drastic unreal solutions. in this context, our country will always be a body of dialog, understanding, and search for peaceful solutions. we are always willing to do what it takes to find common ground and support consensus, as the best tool for peace and development. therefore, at all times we will encourage peoples' reconciliation through mediation and democratic dialog, thus opening spaces towards a future of shared lasting peace. ladies and gentlemen, since the founding of the united nations organization, just over seven decades ago, it has played a central role in keeping a more stable and secure world for the human population across the globe. however, we can never consider this stability as a definitive achievement, we cannot lower our guard knowing, for example, that only in our latin american and caribbean region 35% of the population still belongs to the so-called ""vulnerable claiss"", which means that any setback can send them right back into poverty. furthermore, in terms of security, it is fair to recognize that, like so many other things, it is by far evenly distributed. we ali know that there are tem'tories in the americas, and everywhere in the world, where living peacefully and without fear is almost a utopia, because of the control exercised by organized crime in those territories. what can we then do to build a more incrementally stable world? what measures to take so that widespread safety is not a privilege of a few nations, but extents throughout the world reaching every region and village? obviously i'm not the only one who asks these questions. all present here do them. nor will i give definitive answers, because we can only find them working together. what i will do is to briefly identify what i consider two of the main threats to stability and global security: climate change, drug trafficking and organized crima at first glance, they may seem very different phenomena from each other, of course. however, their level of complexify and global reach make them two of the main challenges facing humanity. in both cases, the consequences are thousands of temilles destroyed, collateral damage on all aspects of human development and states overwhelmed by the magnitude of the challenge they must face. let's start by talking about the consequences of naturai disasters. these phenomena of nature are happening more and more frequently, we just have to open a newspaper, or tum on the television to find the effects of climate change wreaking havoc at one point or another of the planet. from the typhoon that recently hit the philippines with a force not seen in decades, to the cyclonic seasons that punish the caribbean islands with more and more violence, there's not a safe spot on the planet. last year we saw how hurricane irma left havana totally flooded and it took several weeks of heavy effort for to return to a semblance of normality. as for puerto rico, the islands of antigua and barbuda, as well as others in the caribbean, took several months to somewhat recover from the effects of hurricane maria, which not only brought economic losses, but claimed a considerable amount of human lives as well. the dominican republic is strongly committed to prevent the consequences of climate change. as a result we are focusing simultaneously on three levels of action: local, national, and international. because the local level is where the dally life of people develops, it is here where tragedies epitomize a painful reality therefore it is here where the work of building, preparing and raising awareness must begin. at this level, which along the national one. is where our government has more capacity of action, we are improving resilience and relocating the communities that live around our most important watersheds; highly vulnerable to weather phenomena. we are also doing a great deal of local awareness work, such as training thousands of teachers and technicians who will promote sustainable development in their schools and communities. at the national level we are also working tirelessly, both in our rapid reaction strategies, and in the prevention field. thus, for instance, we are planting millions of trees across our territory, while investing in renewable energy as never before. these measures not only support our economy but will as well help reduce our emissions of greenhouse gasses by 25% by 2030. that goal fills us with satisfaction. however, the fight against climate change is everyone's task and that is why this last scenario, the international scenario, is vital; it must be the broadest and most prevalent of the three. a space in which, if there is no political will, most of the efforts become useless and negatively impact all gains achieved at the local and national levels. 6 that is why i reiterate before this assembly, the utmost importance of going beyond good intentions and focusing on concrete actions. and among those actions, i want to once again highlight the urgency of financing and operationaiizing initiatives such as the warsaw international mechanism of ioss and damage that wiii make it possibie to compensate for the destruction of infrastructure, ecosystems, and ease the vulnerability of our residents. this fund is essentiai so that naturai disasters do not destroy in a few hours what many nations have spent decades building. i wili give you just one exampie, keeping in mind that our case is not the most dramatic in the caribbean region. last year, the passage of the storms oiga and maria meant for our country the destruction of infrastructure buiit for a biilion doilars. imagine what that means for a country in which the annuai budget of the state is aiready iimited. but above ail, this fund wiil help protect the valuable lives of miiiions of human beings, bring peace of mind to their homes, aliow them to have a future without the permanent uncertainty of feeiing threatened every time they see the rain coming. for all this, we consider it inevitabie that those countries that have contributed most to the emission of gasses responsible for climate change are those that, proportionaliy, contribute to this fund established to mitigate its effects. ladies and gentlemen, as i described earlier, we consider drug trafficking and organized crime as a threat to globai security and stabiiity of a magnitude similar to climate change. the trafficking of iiiicit substances claims thousands of lives every year, and especialiy young lives, extremely valuable for our countries. but if this were not enough, it permeates our institutions, unbalances our economies, threatens our values and brings nothing but degradation and destruction to our social fabric. wherever organized crime arrives, the security and peace of our people deteriorates over time. therefore, in this area, as with climate change, the fight against drugs must be carried out at the three mentioned levels: local, national and international, in order to achieve effective results. in the case of our country, local intervention is focused on prevention campaigns and the education of our young people, supporting them with training and entrepreneurial opportunities, while improving the 8 neighborhoods in which they reside and recovering public spaces for people to use; ail this with the goal of keeping the most vulnerable population from crime networks. at the national level, the security forces and our national drug control department are battling throughout the entire territory as part of a comprehensive plan to strengthen actions against drug trafficking. among other initiatives, we are acquiring new high-tech equipment and reinforcing security in our ports and airports with more agents and controls, as well as carrying out in-depth interventions in areas with the highest incidence of crime. parallel to this, we have advanced with the approval of a law against money laundering and financing of terrorism, based on the recommendations of the financial action task force, gafilat, with emphasis on prevention of, and fight against, money laundering to which the drug traffickers resort to make their operations profitable. and finally, at the international level, we have bilateral and multilateral agreements with the united states, the european union, and the sica countries; we participate as well in the caribbean basin security initiative, ail with the objective of coordinating efforts and improving our efficiency in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime. thanks to initiatives like these, we are better prepared to fight together against this evil that threatens the integrity of our economies and our democracies. however, we must insist on the need to deepen this intemational coordination. there is much we can move forward if we join efforts, share information and support each other in this work. and here we also understand that showing greater commitment is the responsibility of the countries that, with their domestic demand for narcotics, have set in motion the international machinery of drug trafficking and organized crime. we cannot ignore the fact that it is precisely developing nations that act as the first barrier to containing drug trafficking, thus protecting the most developed countries. to fulfill this role, our countries expend billions of dollars each year, which, however, are never enough in the face of the resources deployed by organized crime, which is undoubtedly a key factor in the social disintegration experienced by many of our countries. as in the case of climate change, it is the more developed countries with more consumption capacity that must deploy more resources, cooperation. 10 and political will, if we reaiiy mean to fight this phenomenon with any hope of victory. in combating the effects of drug trafficking and climate change, we will be solving some of the structural causes that lead countries to deepen poverty and social inequality. if the united nations and the developed countries want to help fight poverty more comprehensively and frankly, these two fronts are a smart, humane and cost-effective way to do it. to them, to their responsibility and solidarity, we appeal once again from this rostrum, to make our planet a safer place. ladies and gentlemen, climate change, drug trafficking, poverty, social inequality, and mass migration are ail interrelated problems that we must deal with urgently. as we have pointed out today, the best and perhaps the only way to do this is to act upon ail levels of response to the problem. so that the agreements signed in a space like the un have a real impact on the life of the people. so that the real needs of our people find expression in their national and even international institutions. 11 therefore, we must all continue to act, according to our abilities but without rest and with the same objective; to create a world that is increasingly stabled, safer, and more developed. a world where all men and all women can carryout their life project. this is the ultimate goal for which the dominican republic will continue to work. in our towns, in our neighborhoods and in all our cities. with our immediate neighbors, with all of you members of this generai assembly. and next year, also as part of the security council of the un, in this new role that we will be honored to assume. thank you very much. 12","danilo medina sánchez, president of the dominican republic, noted that despite the central role of the united nations in maintaining a more stable, secure world for all, we can never consider that stability a definitive achievement nor lower our guard. in the latin american and caribbean region, 35 per cent of the population still belongs to “the so-called ‘vulnerable class’”, meaning they can fall back into poverty at any setback. “living peacefully and without fear is almost a utopia because of the control exercised by organized crime” in territories in the americas and worldwide, he said, identifying climate change, drug trafficking and organized crime as main threats to stability and global security. addressing the increasing frequency of natural hazards, he said that the typhoon that recently hit the philippines “with a force not seen in decades” and the cyclonic seasons in the caribbean mean “there’s not a safe spot on the planet”. adding the impact of hurricane irma on havana, how hurricane maria claimed human lives and brought economic losses to puerto rico, antigua and barbuda, and other caribbean areas, he affirmed his country’s strong commitment to preventing the consequences of climate change. the work of building, preparing and raising awareness must begin at the local level where the daily life of people develops, which is where his government is improving resilience and relocating communities living around important watersheds vulnerable to weather phenomena. however, efforts must also be national and international, he continued. at the national level, his country is planting millions of trees and investing in renewable energy as never before, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent by 2030. however, he added, the fight against climate change is everyone’s task, urgently requiring the financing and operationalizing of such initiatives as the warsaw international mechanism to compensate for the destruction of infrastructure and ecosystems and protect residents. as an example, the storms olga and maria caused $1 billion worth of infrastructure damage in his country. turning to the threat of drug trafficking, he said it claims thousands of lives, mainly young ones, every year, also permeating national institutions, unbalancing economies, threatening values and degrading the social fabric. similarly, “wherever organized crime arrives, the security and peace of our people deteriorates over time”. as with climate change, the fight against drugs must be local, national and international. he cited local intervention in his country that focuses on prevention campaigns, education and training for the young, as well as improving neighborhoods and recovering public spaces. at the national level, security forces and the national drug control department are fighting narcotics trafficking across the country. internationally, the country has bilateral and multilateral agreements with the united states, european union and central american integration system countries, and participates in the caribbean basin security initiative. calling for deeper international coordination, he stated that countries whose domestic demand for drugs has “set in motion the international machinery of drug trafficking and organized crime” must show greater commitment. he added that developing nations act as the first barrier, “thus protecting the most developed countries”. as with climate change, developed countries with greater consumption capacity must deploy more resources, cooperation and political will “if we really mean to fight this phenomenon with any hope of victory”. if the united nations and developed countries want to fight poverty, the two fronts of drug trafficking and climate change “are a smart, humane and cost-effective way to do it”."
Ecuador,,"lenín voltaire moreno garces, president of ecuador, said that everything in life is cause and effect and that human beings tend to scour the past to predict the future. those who govern, leaders and decision-makers have a responsibility in the way the world receives the future. history is something that can change. policies are successful when they strive to address the histories of every single individual, especially the poorest. “we are united nations who are united to change the history of peoples,” he said. ecuador’s plan of government is called “a whole life,” because it wants to be attentive to the human being from the moment they are conceived to the moment of their passing, he continued. being attentive means caring, motivating, and expressing gratitude. caring and encouraging are part of the first phase of life. to look after the child during its first thousand days of life is called “a mission of tenderness”. children are encouraged to study, to play, to be happy, to love science and to delve into technology. it is important to study but also to create. further, elders should live in a society that is grateful for everything they have done, so that those final years are truly their best years. what gave rise to this kind of thinking was the word “perhaps”, he went on to say, describing its application as “perhaps i was born and lived in the amazon region in the lungs of the planet in the most mega-diverse tropical forest in the world. there i got to know the problems of those who are abandoned, without even minimal health coverage”. at the general assembly, member states will combat tuberculosis and the onslaught of non-communicable diseases. yet, access to life-saving medication is denied because privilege is given to intellectual property instead of the right to health care. the more the united nations strives to touch the lives of people, the stronger the world will be in the future, he stressed. ecuador’s “whole-life” program also means all people need to be happy, he pointed out. he noted that, in the great country of the united states, the second line of the declaration of independence states “[w]e hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” that declaration inspired the constitution of that great country. for this, he said, he did not understand how countries such as the united states could blockade an almost defenseless nation such as cuba and prevent others from having their right to freedom and the pursuit of happiness. idealistic young people will not understand how countries, which have achieved a level of superiority in weapons, prefer to see their sons fight in foreign conflicts, he stated. instead of resolving them, they perpetuate them. bankers robbed the pockets of people of ecuador when they made entire families poor, he said, noting that governments, instead of caring for the poor and needy, often do everything that is the opposite. “as a person with a disability, i know there will be no peace unless we have inclusion and we celebrate diversity,” he said, adding that as a president, peace becomes possible when efforts are made on behalf of those who need it most, making sure without exception, that everyone is free to realize their dreams every single day throughout their whole lives."
Egypt,"egypt the permanent mission of egypt i—-iloji to the united nations new york d statement of h.e. abdel fattah al-sisi president of the arab republic of egypt before the 73""*^ session of the united nations general assembly new york, 25 september 2018 unofficial translation madame president, i would like to congratulate you on assuming the presidency of the 73rd session of united nations general assembly, and to express my appreciation for the efforts of mr. miroslav lajcak, the president of the former session. i also commend you onyour choice ofthe theme of this year's session, for we are in dire need for renewing our commitment and contributions towards enhancing the united nations role, as a foundation for a just and effective international order. a world order that is based on the balance of interests and responsibilities, the respect for state sovereignty, the dissemination of a culture ofpeace, as well as one that rises above racism, extremism and violence, and achieves sustainable development. these are the values that shape egypt's vision towards the united nations, since our participation in the inception ofthe organization seven decades ago, and throughout the six terms during which egypt served on the un security council, the latest of which was in 2016-2017. these values are also the driving force behind egypt's active contribution to un peacekeeping operations, rendering egypt the world's seventh largest troop contributing country. with such solid belief in the values and role of the united nations, and in all frankness, we have to admit that there is a flaw in the international system, which negatively affects it's performance, and casts a shadow over its credibility in the eyes of many peoples, particularly in the arab and african regions, wherein egypt lies. for how can we blame an arab who questions the credibility of the united nations and the values it proclaims, at a time when his region is threatened by the disintegration and collapse of the nation state, to give way to a wave of terrorism and sectarian conflicts that deplete the capacities of the arab peoples? or how can we blame an arab who wonders why the palestinian people were denied their legitimate rights lo live in dignity and peace, in an independent state that reflects their national identity, hopes and aspirations? can we consider an overstatement an african's complaint regarding the ineffectiveness of the world order, when his continent suffers from an economic order that perpetuates poverty and inequality, reproduces social and political crises and provides no prospects for progress and development? madame president i raise these questions, as egypt chairs ofthe group of77 and china, which constitutes the majority of the population of this planet, and thus has the greatest interest in enhancing the role of the united nations. for the developing countries can ill afford to exist in an international order, which is not governed by laws and the lofty principles upon which the united nations was founded, or one that can be subject to polarization or attempts by some to dominate over it and impose their will on the members of the intemational community. i would hereby like to summarize egypt's vision in three key principles to which we ought to renew our commitment, and three causes to which we must accord priority, for the united nations to regain its effectiveness and role. the first such principle is that there can be no way forward towards achieving an effective intemational order, if its main constituent unit, the nation-state, which is premised on the notions of citizenship, democracy and equality, is in danger of disintegration. i speak out of egypt's unique experience, where its people have exerted tremendous efforts to restore their state and save their identity. they chose the nation state to be their vehicle for reform and to realize their aspirations for freedom, development and dignity. the disintegration ofnations as aresult ofcivil strife or regression to sectarian loyalties is responsible for the most dangerous phenomena in our contemporary world, including armed conflicts, human trafficking, irregular migration, organized crime and illicit trade in arms and drug trafficking. there is no doubt that the arab region is one ofthe most vulnerable to the dangers of nation state disintegration, and the ensuing creation of a fertile environment for terrorism and exacerbation of sectarian conflicts. thus, preserving and reforming the foundations of the state is a fundamental priority of egypt's foreign policy in the arab region. there can be no way out ofthe crisis in syria and the plight of yemen, except by restoring tlie nation state, preserving its sovereignty and state institutions, as well as realizing the legitimate aspirations of its people. egypt fully supports aun-led political solution in these two countries, and rejects any exploitation ofthe these crises to create footholds for regional interventions, or enable an environment for terrorism, extremism and sectarianism. this same principle applies to our policy in libya, where egypt plays apivotal role in support ofrebuilding the state, particularly with regards to the unification of the libyan aitned forces so that it is capable ofdefending libya and countering the dangers of terrorism. we should not forget that a year has passed since the adoption of the united nations action plan on libya, which sought to comprehensively address the libyan crisis, without achieving progress in its implementation. this requires us to renew our commitment to a comprehensive political solution, assetforth in the said united nations action plan. if we are to halt the loss of life, the depletion of libya's resources, and move towards the reconstruction phase, then there is no room for partial solutions neither in libya nor in syria or yemen; crises ofsuch magnitude require comprehensive and not partial solutions. mr. president the second principle is the commitment topeaceful and sustainable solutions to international conflicts. this is the raison d'etre ofthe united nations. yet, despite the commendable efforts of the un in numerous conflicts, including south sudan, the central african republic and mali, they have so far fallen short of finding permanent settlements to such conflicts. there is also an urgent need to mobilize resources to help countries in postconflict situations to rehabilitate their institutions and commence reconstruction and development. the fundamental issue here is to translate this principle into tangible support for national efforts, so as to overcome conflicts and build states in accordance with their priorities, while avoiding the imposition of alien models of governance and development, or intervening in the internal affairs of states and violating their sovereignty. we cannot talk about the peaceful settlement of disputes as a founding principle ofthe united nations and an indicator ofits credibility, without citing the palestinian cause. it stands as a perfect example of the failure of the international system to find ajust solution to the conflict, based on international legitimacy and united nations resolutions, that guarantees the establishment of a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital. the terms of reference of this just solution and the determinants of a final settlement are well known. there is no time to waste on such a debate. what is required is the political will to resume negotiations and achieve a settlement in accordance with these determinants. i repeat here what i have said in previous years on this platform, the arabs are still stretching out their hands in peace. our peoples deserve to turn this tragic page in history, and the palestinian people deserve to exercise their legitimate rights. madame president, the third principle is the commitment to achieving sustainable development as a necessary precondition for a stable world order, and the best way for the prevention of armed conflict and humanitarian crises. while we welcome the consensus reached on the united nations 2030 sustainable development agenda, we note however that he implementation of the goals set forth in this ambitious plan require that we tackle the financing for development conundrum. this can be achieved though the creation of an enabling environment which allows for the free flow of resources necessary for development, without imposing any conditionalities, and supporting national efforts to mobilize financing for development. the reform of the global economic and financial architecture cannot be delayed. we look forward to the united nations to serve as a platform for developing ideas to achieve this reform, in particular with regards to the creation of mechanisms that would help halt illicit financial flows out of the developing countries, and facilitate the return of these vital assets to their rightful owners. madame president the international commitment to the preservation of the nation state, the peaceful settlement ofdisputes, strengthening cooperation to achieve comprehensive development and addressing imbalances in the global economic system are all necessary conditions for any serious consideration of the revitalization ofthe united nations system and the restoration of its credibility. in order to implement these three aforementioned principles three main priority areas also need to be addressed, in order to ensure the credibility and the future of the united nations and the international order as a whole. first: we need to strengthen partnerships between the united nations and regional organizations, to meet the rising challenges the international community faces at the political, economic and developmental levels, as well as the security threats, including protracted conflicts and the proliferation of terrorism. here, i would particularly like to emphasize the successful partnership that exists between the united nations and the african union, as a model for burden sharing and leveraging the comparative advantages of each organization to address the complex challenges facing our continent, particularly in the fields of peacekeeping, peace 4 building, as well as humanitarian and developmental assistance. as egypt will shortly assume the presidency of the african union in 2019, we look forward to strengthening the strategic partnership between the union and the united nations, through programs that have a real impact on the continent, and building on the progress made to consolidate the african union's post-conflict reconstruction and development policy. this is in addition to egypt's hosting of the african union center for post-conflict, reconstruction and development and the community of sahel-saharan states counter-terrorism center. second: we need to continue our efforts to implement the initiative launched by egypt during its membership of the un security council, to put in place a comprehensive international framework to develop policies and bolster cooperation, in order to counter terrorism and terrorist narratives. in this context, we welcome the secretary-general's initiative to convene the united nations conference on counter terrorism last june, following the periodic review of the united nations counterterrorism strategy. as you are well aware, egypt is engaged, since the beginning of this year in the comprehensive operation ""sinai 2018"" to combat and decisively eradicate terrorism. this is taking place through a comprehensive strategy that integrates the security, ideological and developmental dimensions. based on this experience and on egypt's overall experience in supporting counter- terrorism efforts in the middle east and north africa, i can assure you that the level of finance, the sophistication of arms and training, as well as the means of communication obtained by these extremist groups, and the facilitation of movement and travel of foreign terrorist fighters, point to the inevitable need to develop a global system to combat terrorism wherever it exists, and to counter whoever provides it with support in any possible way. third: we need to address the major shortcomings in the international community's handling of human rights issues. the credibility of the united nations cannot be restored, as long as millions continue to suffer from extreme poverty, live under foreign occupation or fall victim to terrorism and armed conflict. the protection ofhuman rights will not be realized through media defamation orthe politicization ofhuman rights mechanisms, while ignoring the need to tackle all human rights in an equitable manner, including economic, social and cultural rights on equal footing. egypt has a solid constitutional foundation for the protection of human rights. major strides have been achieved in the field of women and youth empowerment. women hold 25% of the ministerial posts and more than 15% of seats in parliament. international youth conferences, which are held annually in egypt in november, have also become a regular forum for the youth to communicate and raise their concerns. we are determined to continue to accord high priority to the issues of women economic empowerment, and the causes of the youth, science, technology and innovation during egypt's presidency of the group of 77 and china, as a practical example of our commitment to the promotion of human rights in a comprehensive manner. madame president, egypt, like the vast majority ofthe world's peoples and nations, has a vested interest inrestoring the credibility ofthe multilateral system with the united nations at its forefront. we believe that the organization can overcome skepticism over its merits and credibility by restoring the lofty principles upon which its charter was premised, and acting according to the priorities i addressed, which reflect the aspirations of our peoples. only then will our organization reclaim its credibility, and our peoples regain their confidence in a future ofpeace, cooperation and respect of one another. thank you for listening. may god help us and you for the good of all our peoples.","abdel fattah al sisi, president of egypt, pointed to a flaw in the international system, which negatively affects its performance and casts a dark shadow over its credibility in the eyes of many people, particularly in the arab and african regions. “developing countries can ill afford to exist in an international order, which is not governed by laws,” he continued. there is no doubt that the arab region is one of the most vulnerable to the dangers of nation state disintegration, and the ensuing creation of a fertile environment for terrorism and the exacerbation of conflict, he said. there can be no way out of the crisis in syria and the plight of yemen, except by restoring the nation state, preserving its sovereignty and government institutions, he said. expressing support for the united nations–led political solution in those two countries, he said the same principle applies to the policy in libya, where egypt plays a pivotal role in support of rebuilding the state. a year has passed since the adoption of the united nations action plan on libya. and despite the commendable efforts of the organization in numerous conflicts, including south sudan, the central african republic and mali, many have fallen short of finding permanent settlements to such disputes, he said. “we cannot talk about the peaceful settlement of disputes without citing the palestinian cause,” he continued, adding that the situation there is a “perfect example” of the failure of the international system to find a just solution to a conflict. political will to resume negotiations and achieve a settlement is key. “i repeat here what i have said in previous years on this platform, the arabs are still stretching out their hands in peace,” he said. pledging commitment to sustainable development, he emphasized the critical need to “tackle the financing for development conundrum”. that can be achieved through the creation of an enabling environment which allows for the free flow of resources necessary for development, without imposing any conditionalities. he welcomed the united nations serving as a platform for developing ideas to achieve this reform. he emphasized the importance of strengthening partnerships between the united nations and regional organizations, to meet the rising challenges the international community faces at the political, economic and developmental levels. egypt will shortly resume the presidency of the african union in 2019, he said, adding his government was looking forward to strengthening the strategic partnership between the union and the united nations. egypt plans to implement the initiative launched during its membership of the united nations security council focused on boosting cooperation to counter-terrorism and the terrorist narrative. egypt needs to also address the major shortcomings in the international community’s handling of human rights issues. he said that egypt has a solid constitutional foundation for the protection of human rights. major strides have been achieved in the field of women and youth empowerment. women now hold 25 per cent of the ministerial posts and more than 15 per cent of the seats in parliament, he said."
El Salvador,,"salvador sánchez cerén, president of el salvador, expressed to the secretary-general the urgent need to close the funding gap hampering the sustainable development goals. saying el salvador has allocated an unprecedented 50 per cent of its budget to achieve them, his country still requires the international community to shoulder its burden. el salvador is vulnerable in many respects, he said, with climate change being a major threat. his country recently suffered through one of the worst droughts in its history due to climate change, driving it to invest further in food security. el salvador produces virtually no pollution but suffers from climate change caused by others. adding the country is moving to large-scale restoration of its ecosystems, he thanked unep for accepting their proposal for the 2020-2030 united nations decade for ecosystems and invited the international community to support its adoption. noting that his nation had reduced poverty by 10 per cent between 2009-2017, he pointed to broader initiatives to improve living conditions. he said there are now 100 municipalities with no illiteracy, including san salvador, the third latin american city to achieve that, thanking cuba for its support. his country has focused on defending women’s rights and preventing femicide and sexual violence, and has a national strategy to reduce maternal mortality. he looked forward to the impending canonization of bishop oscar romero by pope francis, which the people of el salvador will celebrate with joy and hope. turning to migration, he welcomed the intergovernmental conference to adopt the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and the global compact on refugees, which are clear examples of the united nations seeking worldwide consensus. families coming from the northern triangle of central america have suffered, harming boys and girls. he called on united states authorities to speed up the reunification of children with their families. el salvador is working to improve living conditions, reducing irregular migration to the united states by 60 per cent, but he absolutely rejected any criminalization of migrants, who contribute to societies to which they migrate. he urged competent bodies in the united states to provide greater migration security under temporary protected status and deferred action for child arrivals. as a founding member state of the united nations, el salvador supports multilateralism in all endeavors and constructive international dialogs which can lead to political solutions, he said. calling for an end to unilateral measures, including the unjust blockade of cuba by the united states and sanctions against venezuela, he said that such coercive measures must end."
Equatorial Guinea,,"teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo, president of equatorial guinea, noting that 2018 marks the fiftieth anniversary of his country’s independence, said the well-being of humanity — a fundamental goal of the united nations — could not have been achieved without freedom and dignity for the peoples and nations of the world. people who were subjected to the will of others when the organization was founded in 1945 are now free, he said, calling for an end to colonialism wherever it still exists, and in whatever form it takes. despite efforts at the united nations to promote sustainable development, an ever-widening gap between developed and developing countries makes it hard to maintain international peace and security, he said. national pride must be set aside in the quest to achieve the sustainable development goals and agenda 2063 of the african union. massive migration from the south to the north, internal instability in developing countries, terrorism and rebel movements are reactions to poverty and underdevelopment which result from the absence of solidarity and justice. as a non‑permanent member of the security council, equatorial guinea supports preventative diplomacy and the peaceful settlement of conflicts, he continued. he emphasized the principles of international law, respect for the sovereignty of states, non‑interference in other states’ affairs and the rights of countries to exploit their own resources, to name a few. he also applauded peace efforts between ethiopia and eritrea, the united states and the democratic people’s republic of korea, among others, stating that similar paths should be taken to resolve other conflicts. emphasizing that coercive measures have never resolved conflicts, but run counter to the principle of state sovereignty, he said the security council must be reformed to make it more democratic and representative. its current structure is obsolete because the political criteria that prevailed in 1945 no longer govern the world. africa is the future of humanity and it should not be disenfranchised and left out of major decisions, he said, adding that the council should shoulder its responsibility for recent conflicts in the sahel and for uncontrolled migration from africa to europe. reviewing the situation in his country, he said its economic emergence will be achieved in a relatively short period of time. politically, the transition to a multiparty system has been characterized by open dialog, with 18 political parties — in a country of less than 1.4 million people — now recognized. pointing to constitutional amendments, including presidential term limits, he called on friendly nations and multilateral organizations to support the government’s economic reforms. the united nations, he underscored, should not only be a forum for dialog, but also a forum for cooperative exchanges to promote the development of humanity."
Eritrea,"statement by his excellency mr. osman saleh mohammed minister of foreign affairs of the state of eritrea at the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly new york 29 september 2018 1 madam president, honorable heads of delegation, ladies and gentlemen, let me join previous speakers to convey our congratulations for your election as president of the 73rd session of the un general assembly. this forum provides, annually, a congenial platform for the member states to broach critical issues of international peace and security and their ra ifications on national and human development. in this spirit, allow me to bring to the attention of this august assembly key matters of para ount importance to my country and our region as a whole. as you are all aware, eritrea a d ethiopia have recently signed a historic peace agreement that brings to an end the dark, two-decades-old, a chapter of war, constant tension, and strife. this historic achievement - even if belated by almost 16 years - will allow both countries to funnel their resources, potential and positive energy solely towards much-needed development. it has already infused hope and optimism on the peoples of both countries. its positive dividend for regional peace and security is too palpable to merit emphasis. this is indeed attested by new frameworks of all-rounded cooperation that have been set in motion in the past two months or that are on the offing at the regional level. eritrea wishes to express its gratitude to various countries that contributed in different ways, and that have demonstrated their political goodwill, to the success of the historical process underway. madam president, distinguished delegates, let me now revert to a perplexing injustice that has afflicted my country for almost a decade. i am referring to the unwarranted sanctions that were imposed on eritrea in december 2009 and 2011 respectively. with positive winds of peace flowing in our region, several unsc member states are these days calling for the immediate lifting of the deplorable sanctions. the diplomatic discourse is not however fully coherent. as it happens, some countries are looking for procedural and other pretexts and preconditions. the apparent aim is to move the goalpost and maintain the illegal sanctions on eritrea. 1 as an aggrieved party, which has stood for nine long years on the receiving end of the miscarriage of justice, eritrea cannot and will not plead for clemency or magnanimity. the people and government of eritrea will continue to stand up for their rights until justice is ascertained and wrongs meted to them are redressed. madam president, distinguished delegates, the transgressions perpetrated against eritrea are, in many ways, symptomatic of the hubris and perverse power games that have primarily governed international relations in our contemporary times. the spiraling crises, instability, wars, and conflicts that have, and continue to rage, in various parts of the world are inevitable consequences of the absence of justice; the attendant outcomes of international power imbalance. when the rule of law is suppressed and supplanted by the logic of force; when global power balance is compromised, the inevitable outcomes are intractable crises and escalating wars. it is against this disconcerting global backdrop that eritrea was first victimized and targeted for unlawful and unfair sanctions on 23 december 2009. i will not bore you with details of the incontrovertible facts; of how and why this act was imposed; as all relevant information - including confidential communications, (wikileaks and all) - have since long been available in the public domain. however, to sum up, the interplay of forces and factors that brought about the sanctions were the following: 1. the principal architects of the sanctions were previous us administrations who felt that they could use their unassailable power, and raw coercion, to ram through the unsc, punitive measures against a small country and people to advance their misguided regional agenda. it is worth remembering here that certain officials in the us administration had mulled imposing similar sanctions on eritrea in 1999-2000, at the height of the border war with ethiopia, in order to impose asymmetric arrangements through coercive means. the fabricated charges peddled in 2009 were, in fact, suitable improvisations to implement a prevalent age da. 2. the second cause for the imposition of the sanctions was the inability of the un system to prevent such wrongs from happening as well as systemic flaws/political horse-trading in the operations of the un security council. here again, one must remember that the unsc had failed to take any meaningful action against ethiopia. this was despite the fact that pre ious ethiopian regimes had flagrantly violated the un charter and the algiers peace agreement guaranteed by the same unsc when they refused to abide by the final and binding decisions of april 13, 2002 of the eritreaethiopia boundary commission, (the eebc). 2 jl 3. the t ird factor in the imposition of the sanctions was the existence of governments that served the agenda of major po ers. in the case of the sanctions on eritrea, the principal architects resorted to regional trojan horses to imbue an african face to their resolutions. madam president, distinguished delegates, the sanctions imposed on eritrea for the last nine years have entailed considerable economic damage to the country and unnecessary hardships on its people. the related campaigns of smear and defamation have inculcated immeasurable damage to the reputation of the country and to the prospects and potential of investment. perhaps, the biggest damage was the regional instability and insecurity that this state of affairs bred and exacerbated. the actual cost incurred and the opportunities forfeited - both at the national and regional le els - are thus huge. in the event and in light of the widely acclaimed peace and cooperation that has broken in the region, certain countries to choose to ignore the stark truth and to prolong the sanctions regime in eritrea is astounding. in the past six decades, the eritrean people have waged long and difficult struggles to advance the cause of justice and to foster a climate that is conducive for mutual security and stability in the region. these robust convictions and legacy ha e indeed enabled them to withstand all the wrongs and scars inculcated by the unfair sanctions. through characteristic resilience and hard toil, they have now vanquished the injustices perpetrated on them. as i stressed earlier, the people of eritrea have not committed a crime or transgression that impels them to seek clemency. as such, they are not only calling for the immediate rescinding of the sanctions but they are also asking, and deserve, amends for the damages incurred and opportunities forfeited. i thank you! 3","osman mohammed saleh, minister for foreign affairs of eritrea, recalled the recent peace agreement between eritrea and ethiopia that ended two decades of war, constant tension and strife. “this historic agreement — even if belated by almost 16 years — will allow both countries to funnel their resources, potential and positive energy solely towards much-needed development,” he said, noting that the agreement has already infused hope and optimism. he emphasized the accord’s positive dividend for regional peace and security and thanked all parties who contributed to the process. he said that the sanctions imposed on eritrea in december 2009 and 2011 respectively were unwarranted and a perplexing injustice. with “positive winds of peace flowing in the region, he echoed the call of several security council members for their immediate lifting. some countries are looking for procedural and other pretexts and preconditions apparently aimed at moving the goalpost and maintaining the illegal sanctions on eritrea. “as an aggrieved party on the receiving end of the miscarriage of justice, eritrea cannot and will not plead for clemency or magnanimity,” he said. “the people and government of eritrea will continue to stand up for their rights until justice is ascertained and wrongs meted to them are redressed.” calling the transgressions perpetrated against eritrea symptomatic of hubris and perverse power games governing international relations, he noted that spiraling crises, instability and wars in the world are inevitable consequences of the absence of justice and the attendant outcome of international power imbalance. the sanctions were due to the imposition of the united states as the principal architect using its unassailable power to advance a misguided regional agenda, the inability of the united nations system to prevent such wrongs from happening as well as systemic flaws and political horse-trading in the security council. this happened even though previous ethiopian regimes had flagrantly violated the united nations charter and the algiers peace agreement. he argued that the principal architects of the sanctions resorted to regional trojan horses to imbue an “african face” to their resolutions. the sanctions caused economic damages to the country and unnecessary hardship for its people, he said. the related smear campaigns and defamation have caused immeasurable damage to eritrea’s reputation and investment prospects, while the cost and loss of opportunity resulting from regional instability and insecurity — perhaps the greatest damage caused by the sanctions — has been huge. he underlined the resilience and hard toil of the eritrean population to advance justice and foster a climate conducive to security and stability amid the unfair sanctions. “the people of eritrea have not committed a crime or transgression that impels them to seek clemency,” he reiterated, calling for an immediate rescinding of the sanctions and amends for the damages incurred and opportunities forfeited."
Estonia,"check against deliver address by the president of the republic of estonia kersti kaljulaid at the united nations general assembly madam president, mr. secretary general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen ten days ago i was in ukraine. picking up syringes and empty bottles in a park next to a kindergarten in the industrial city of dnipro. it was for the first world clean-up day. the biggest ever civil society action fostered by digital technologies and voluntary will ofmillions. 15 million in 140 countries, among them many presidents and prime ministers, decided to do something for our planet. having responded to the outcry of estonians who launched the voluntary clean up action 10 years ago. it is very easy just to talk about a cleaner environment or climate change. but if you really want to get things done, then very often you simply must get up and do it yourself. in many ways this is also the reason why estonia is running for the non-permanent seat at the un security council for 2020-2021. small countries have no time for small objectives - our aim is, among other issues, to bring all things digital to the un and security council - cyber risks are something estonians as citizens of a fully digitized state understand better than most. we want to offer our perspective to make sure that human beings remain safe in this new world were cyber related threats compound with conventional ones. the vision that we have for the candidacy and for the un as a whole is based on three keywords - empathy, equality and efficiency. first, about empathy. however sad, we must talk about our worries honestly. aggression should be called aggression, war is war, and occupation remains occupation. regardless if it's afnca or europe that we are talking about. i am deeply touched by the misery that war and conflict bring, whether it's talking with internally displaced women and children in occupied eastern ukraine. or with georgian politicians being told that due to occupation their country will be forever denied full participation in the democratic world in the formats we, luckier others, so cherish. estonia stands in solidarity with all those affected by conflict, terrorism and violent extremism. we reach out with humanitarian aid, practical assistance and also peacekeepers, from africa to middle east. we do what we can, yet it feels like it is never enough. ongoing military aggression in eastern ukraine continues in the very heart of europe. crimean peninsula remains occupied, as do parts of georgia, and there is check against deliver no resolution of the conflicts in africa. it is hard to tolerate these sad issues. yet it is no solution to mince words to make ourselves feel better. for those in distress, recognition of their true situation, together with the humble recognition that we cannot do much more than commiserate, is offering at least some hope. some hope that one day things could be better. a hope that cannot feed on euphemisms avoiding straightforward admittance. in july, we reached an agreement on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. and i'm looking forward to its adoption in marrakech in december. but an agreement needs implementation. without implementation, it is hollow, as hollow as the days ahead for those not knowing where they should lay their head for the night. or how to calm their crying, hungry and frightened children. we need to get up and just help. the same applies to the paris climate agreement. in order to tackle the global challenge of climate change that is affecting billions we must implement the commitments we have collectively taken. because the effects of climate change are increasingly felt all over the world. not only in the developing countries, especially by smaller island states, where homes, food and even clean drinking water are greatly at risk and countries are forced to jump through varied and expensive loops in order to gain access to relief funding. but also in the developed world, where people have lost their loved ones or homes in european forest fires. or through hurricanes in america and the pacific. yet we are still not dealing with root causes. making the world safe for our children by applying the proper and best available technology standards to all energy production and use - both in the developed as well as in developing world. we should also, and yes, that simply, never forget to switch the light off when leaving the room, get a conditioner which stops when we open the door - do what we can when we see that globally we cannot, yet. ladies and gentlemen we are all equals in this hall. not only because we have declared so in the un charter. but also because the challenges we now face are going to affect each and every one of us. equality in the face of global challenges is the law of nature. much stronger than our international law could ever be. yet international legal space matters, as common solutions demand respect of each and every one. check against deliver we see solution in liberal thinking that progress is possible not through polarization, fragmentation or tribalism. progress is the force bom out of debate and seeking common solutions. sovereign equality, the idea that all sovereign states are equal, is a fundamental tenet of international law and relations. the role of the un is to provide this equality, as a guarantor ofthe mles-based global system. we depend on each other, whether we like it or not. and very often it's not the state or intemational organizations that get things done. but grass-root activism and ngo's who have a vision and a sense of responsibility. principled voluntary approach can shift mountains of inefficiency, bad govemance, neglect and lack of ideas. it can guide and catalyze policymaking, but not replace it. recent gender equality movements like heforshe have come a long way to counter gender-based and sexual violence. gender equality is at the very heart of human rights. this in mind, estonia works actively in the commission on the status of women. i have gladly accepted secretary general guterres' invitation to co-chair the high-level steering group for every woman every child for the next two years. during my tenure i intend to raise awareness of the heroic efforts people globally are making, often working without any institutional support. i wish to demonstrate how many good ideas globally there are, already found, already tried but only on the small scale. ideas which help someone somewhere, waiting to be discovered and upscaled in order to help as many in the world as possible. i hope to provide recognition, but also dissemination ofbest practices - often it is the same thing. this is how i can personally get something done. dear colleagues in terms of efficiency —and that is my third keyword - nothing is more important than truly effective multilateralism. due to its inclusiveness, this organization holds great legitimacy. and due to its high standards, a moral force. intemational law should be the primary yardstick of national interest. those not so powerful understand it well. on security council reform, we need to win more space for common ground. peoples and states, both big and small, should feel that the security council acts in their best interests. for too often, the council falls victim of its intemal differences check against deliver and clumsy procedures. however, it should not be rendered powerless, especially when mass atrocities are being committed. we, together with the accountability, coherence and transparency group, have called for the security council members to feel the responsibility and be held more accountable if blocking action against breaches of international humanitarian law. it is telling that already 117 states have signed code of conduct launched by the act group. furthermore, we support continuously the proposal of france and mexico that in the face of great human suffering the permanent members should voluntarily restrain from the use of the veto. ladies and gentlemen, furthermore on efficiency ict can revolutionize entrepreneurship, education, employment in general, even healthcare. digital online services provide economic growth; bring down unnecessary barriers between citizen and state, between businesses and sectors, and exceed geographical limits. estonia has shared its knowledge with many nations of the world and will continue to do so, in cooperation with undp, african union and all those interested and willing. new technologies should always be seen as enablers. they create equal opportunities, if supported by proper policies. the risks related to them should not be ignored - also because they do not replace but rather enhance most of our conventional risks. but well set international legal space should be able to deliver for humankind and avoid armageddon scenarios. no new technology can thrive in a fragmented world. now more than ever, we need global free trade as an essential element of fostering long-term development and growth. estonia as a small export-dependent country is an advocate of free trade. including creating better market access for developing countries and improving business conditions for investments. trade and economy are closely linked with security, as history has so often demonstrated. we stand to protect what the developed world has achieved. what the wto stands for. and what aspiring regions and bodies have set out to achieve. for example, freedom oftrade and work in africa through legal space setting by the afiican union. we wish them quick success. and we stand by them to help where we can with our own leapfrogging experience in digital technologies. madam president, check against deliver empathy starts at home. if we want to care about the others, we need to care about ourselves as well as the people and environment around us. being connected and dependent of each other more than ever, we simply cannot afford to be self-centered and ignorant. we all need to see the bigger picture. empathy can easily be translated into efficiency if we really wish to get things done. words are important, but they are not sufficient if not followed by concrete action. wars and conflicts continue, global warming speeds up and piles of litter around us just keep growing. we have equal responsibility to be more pro-active in preventing and solving the challenges of our times. when feeling helpless, then it's sometimes best to do the little thing you possibly can. globally, if we all do our bit, things can only get better. our globe cannot take any more fi-ee riding. any more hand wringing that ""we cannot"". any more inaction. any more hiding behind our current comforts - in order to forget what will be the state of the world we leave to our children. so let's act individually and collectively. today. every day. thank you!","kersti kaljulaid, president of estonia, noting that her country is running for a seat at the united nations security council, said that: “small countries have no time for small objectives. our aim is, among other issues, to bring all things digital to the united nations and security council.” cyber risks are something estonians as citizens of a fully digitized state understand better than most and her country can offer a perspective to make sure that human beings remain safe. in the heart of europe, ongoing military aggression in eastern ukraine continues, she said. parts of georgia and the crimean peninsula remain occupied. there is no resolution of the conflicts in africa. while her country contributes humanitarian aid, practical assistance and peacekeepers, it often feels like it is never enough. estonia reached an agreement on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, but such an accord needs implementation or else it is hollow. the same applies to the paris agreement on climate change. “we are still not dealing with root causes,” she said. in terms of efficiency, she noted the importance of truly effective multilateralism, and due to its inclusiveness, this organization holds great legitimacy. on security council reform, there needs to be more space for common ground, with people and states, both big and small, feeling that the security council acts in their best interests. for too often, the council has fallen victim to internal differences and clumsy procedures. it is critical that the council not be rendered powerless, especially when mass atrocities are being committed. information and communications technology can revolutionize entrepreneurship, education, employment and healthcare, she noted. digital online services provide economic growth and bring down barriers between citizens and the state. new technologies should be seen as enablers, creating new opportunities if supported by proper policies. however, no new technology can thrive in a fragmented world. now more than ever, global free trade as an essential element of fostering long‑term development and growth is needed. because, now more than ever, the international community is connected and dependent of each other, it cannot afford to be self-centered or ignorant, she emphasized, adding that “we all need to see the bigger picture”. such empathy can be translated into efficiency if there is a desire to get things done, and although words are important, they need to be followed by concrete actions. “we have equal responsibility to be more proactive in preventing and solving the challenges of our times,” she said."
Eswatini,"permanent mission of the kingdom of eswatini to the united nations statement by his majesty king mswati iii head of state of the kingdom of eswatini during the general debate of 73rd session of the united nations general assembly 26 september 2018 new york east 50th street ¦ new york, ne york 10022 • (212) 371-8910 • fax: (212) 754-2755 • eswatini@un.int 1 madam president, your excellenc es, heads of states and government, united nations secretary-general, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, introduction it is a great honor for me to address this 73rd united nations general assembly, where we have come to renew our commitment to creating an enabling environment for all mankind. unga theme madam president, the theme of this session, making the united nations relevant to all people: global leade ship and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies , resonates well with the un general assembly resolution 72 / 276 adopted on the 31st may 2018. the resolution is aimed at repositioning the un development system to better support countries towards the achievement of the sustainable development goals (sdgs), under stronger national leadership and international cooperation. role of the un when un was established by our predecessors back in 1945, the main purpose was to reduce tensions and avert another conflict after world war ii. since then, we have converged at this general assembly as a family to renew this commitment and analyze how we address challenges affecting the world. it is a time to assess whether we are still living up to the ethos of our forefathers, that sought to ensure the world never again gets to endure another world war, but rather finds peaceful solutions to resolving possible conflict. we are all aware of the existing pockets of tensions in different regions of the world which require that un member states speak in one voice when providing possible peaceful solutions. a fragmented approach would render peaceful solutions elusive for the affected countries. 2 it is therefore imperative that we engage and resolve issues together as a united nations family in order to ensure we end up with lasting solutions. to those countries experiencing conflict situations, we appeal to them to come up with home-grown solutions to address their differences. we urge these nations to avoid the use of force in an attempt to impose change. where they do not see eye to eye, they need to adopt dialog as the best way to find lasting solutions. where there is no loss of blood, unity prevails, whereas violence begets instability. those who have lost lives and property in conflicts don t forget and their bitterness makes nation building efforts much harder to achieve. the un member states are strongly urged to avoid fuelling tensions in troubled countries with a divided approach to interventions, as this subsequently defeats the purpose of the establishment of the united nations. our approach should always be to search and find an amicable way forward to all the challenges we face for the greater good of mankind. social elfare challenges another great concern is the imbalance between the rich and poor which continues to widen by the day. this is despite putting in place sustainable development goals aimed at bridging this divide. as a un family we need to pay serious attention to these imbalances as they contribute to terrorism and social strife in the world. the afr can union has also set out to improve lives with a goal to realize a well developed africa for all by 2063. it is important to support such programs, which are similar to initiatives of other regions of the world, some of which have recorded great advancement in this regard. we urge the successful blocs to play a meaningful role in supporting developing countries that have good programs to transform their economies but lack the means to do so. the slow process of development for these countries adds to the burden of failing to cater for the social needs of the people. 3 we need to find ways and solutions to speed up the process of developing sustainable economies in line with our sustainable goals by removing the stumbling blocks to development. it is perhaps time that we engage researchers to look into what developing countries need in order to fast-track economic growth and identify high turnover capital projects that would be best suited to catalyze this endeavor. no country deserves to go for a whole year without investment. there are numerous successful countries that can share their experiences of success. we can use these to assist developing countries in order to ensure that no country is left behind as we strive to achieve our developmental objectives. the african continent remains challenged with various diseases such as ebola, hiv, malaria, tb, and many others that require large sums of funding to overcome. africa has taken a resolution to eliminate these diseases within a short space of time. however, without funding this will remain a challenge. some of these health issues need further analysis as in some cases, where we have recorded success; we are confronted with the re-emergence of some of them in a more vicious state. it would be remiss of us not to thank and commend the support we receive from members of the un family to needy countries, especially for health issues in africa. we need to ensure that every citizen has access to basic needs such as clean water, health and free primary education. we commend those countries that have reached the level of providing free education. it is only through investing in education that nations may produce a highly qualified citizenry and get to realize their full development potential. the need to reduce unemployment is a global challenge. so too is catering for the elderly community that has contributed immensely to the development of each country. they deserve to be cared for once they have run their mile. addressing these issues is increasingly becoming a challenge given the declining donor funding, which means more hardships for our people. 4 we should, however, seek alternative means of raising funding to avoid the undesirable situation where people resort to helping themselves cope with the global challenges. this poses a threat to peace as they may do so in ways that would divert resources from addressing already ex sting challenges, such as diseases. the un and the. african continent ma am president, it is unfortunate that the african continent continues to absorb more peacekeeping missions than any other united nations regional grouping. this qualifies africa proper representation in areas of peace and security, making it a key player as and when matters of peace and security are discussed in all structures of the united nations. we therefore plead that africa should not be left behind. her voice must be heard and featured prominently and permanently at the united nations. as negotiations of reforms of the united nations security council progress, the kingdom of eswatini calls for favorable consideration of the common african posit on and also for those countries that are not members of the security council. africa calls for the allocation of not less than two permanent seats, with all the prerogatives and privileges of permanent membership - including the right of veto; and five non-permanent seats, in the united nations security council. progress made in sustainable development goals madam president, we remain confident that the sustainable development goals (sdgs) and agenda 2063 of the african union will continue to give us the proper guidance and impetus necessary to eradicate poverty and create inclusive and sustainable development for all. the kingdom of eswatini has made significant strides in localizing and integrating the sdgs in its national planning processes. we have finalized the review of the national development strategy (nds) 1997-2022 and will soon be launching a revised national strategy. the strategy is themed: the development strategy for eswatini - promoting sustainable development and inclusive growth. this is expected to accelerate the implementation of the sdgs in the kingdom. 5 innovation and research the kingdom of eswatin is fully involved in working towards a knowledgebased economy through development of science, technology and innovation infrastructure in a bid to facilitate research and development. the royal science and technology park continues to be a key entity aimed at advancing scientific research and related fields. we would like to express our profound gratitude to the friends of the kingdom who are supporting us in our endeavor to develop these fundamental initiatives. however, this work remains in progress since innovation, research and development are evolving. therefore, the kingdom continues to seek more support for further strengthening of these initiatives that contribute to attainment of our national vision of 2022 and the 2030 sustainable development goals. parliame tary national elections 2018 madam president, ust a few days ago, the people of the kingdom of eswatini held a very peaceful national election, which was free and fair. we are glad that international observers were in attendance to monitor the elections, and their conclusions were in line with our expectations. during the elections, the people nominate candidates in their chiefdoms to compete at constituency level, which we call tinkhundla. the system ensures direct participation and promotes participatory democracy among our people. it is home grown and is enshrined in our customs, traditions and constitution. we fully support the participation of women in political decision-making positions and have recently enacted the election of women members to the house of assembly act to ensure their representation in parliament. gender equality madam president, as a country we have also successfully enacted the sexual offenses and domestic violence act, a legal framework to protect women from domestic violence and sexual assault. 6 this will give effect to relevant international legal instruments, including the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (cedaw), among others. 50/50 national do le celebrations we are pleased to inform this noble assembly that the kingdom celebrated her 50 years of independence early this year. we were grateful that the country has been able to champion her development agenda as a free nation for 50 years. during this celebration the nation decided to revert to our original name, which is eswatini. since time immemorial the name for the kingdom has always been eswatini. middle-income categorisation madam president, let me emphasize that the united nations call to leave no one behind, requires their identification, knowing where they are and understanding how they live- as well as identifying how they can be assisted in order to be at par with the rest. addressing these issues will go a long way in rendering the united nations more relevant to all people in the world. we would like to bring to your attention the unfavorable impact of being categorized as middle-income country on accessing external resources. this comes at a time when we need even more resources to inject innovations into our development programs around sdgs. we sincerely hope that the commendable reform efforts of the secretarygeneral will help support and reinforce our efforts in accessing external resources and securing sustainable funding mechanisms, that will assist us advance towards realization of the sdgs by 2030. re blic of china, taiwan madam president, the kingdom of eswatini reiterates her unwavering stance in calling upon the united nations to afford the people of the republic of china, taiwan, the opportunity to partake and contribute to the united nations development system. 7 taiwan s experience in the various fields, vital to the dimensions of sustainable development, would go a long way in contributing to the work and membership of the united nations. it is a strong call that the people of taiwan are not left behind in making the united nations relevant to all people to be in line with the spirit of universality. conclusion madam president, as i conclude, let me extend my congratulations on your election as the president of this 73rd session of this assembly. we commend the united nations general assembly for the choice and the confidence it has in you as the fourth female president of this august body in its 73 years of existence. let me assure you of the kingdom's full support as you execute your duties and responsibilities during your term of office. we further appreciate the secretary-general and all members of his staff for the continued support and hard work in improving the working mechanisms and relevance of the un systems to all member states. from this session we hope we shall come out with meaningful goals that will chart a better future for our respective countries. i thank you - may the almighty god bless us all.","mswati iii, head of state of eswatini, expressed support for assembly resolutions aimed at repositioning the united nations development system to better support countries in their efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals under stronger national leadership and international cooperation. citing the existence of pockets of tensions across the globe “which require that all member states speak in one voice when providing peaceful solutions”, he warned that a fragmented approach will render peaceful solutions elusive. appealing to countries embroiled in conflict to come up with “home‑grown solutions” to address their differences, he urged them to avoid the use of force and employ dialog. “where there is no loss of blood, unity prevails, whereas violence begets instability,” he said. outlining another major concern, he said the imbalance between rich and poor people continues to widen despite attempts to implement the sustainable development goals. such imbalances contribute to terrorism and social strife, he warned, voicing support for agenda 2063 and its goal of improving lives and realizing a well‑developed africa by that date. expressing support for such programs, he said the slow progress of development adds to many countries’ burdens and prevents them from meeting the needs of their people. “we need to find ways and solutions to speed up the process of developing sustainable economies […] by removing the stumbling blocks to development,” he said. emphasizing that “no country deserves to go for a whole year without investment”, he warned against leaving developing countries behind. the african continent, in particular, still faces challenges including such diseases as ebola, hiv/aids, malaria and tuberculosis, and will continue to do so without funding. all citizens must have access to basic services such as clean water, health care and free primary education. commending countries that have succeeded in providing those, he spotlighted the need to reduce unemployment and care for older persons as additional important global challenges. calling for international cooperation as well as alternative means of funding, he noted that africa continues to absorb more peacekeeping missions than any other united nations regional grouping. “this qualifies africa [for] proper representation in areas of peace and security,” he stressed, emphasizing that the continent’s voice must be heard and featured prominently and permanently at the united nations. as talks on security council reform progress, he stressed the need to consider the common african position — namely, calls for the allocation of no fewer than two permanent council seats with all the prerogatives and privileges of permanent membership, including the veto power, and five non‑permanent seats. he went on to outline national progress made in mainstreaming the targets of the sustainable development goals and agenda 2063 into eswatini’s development framework. among other things, the country has made strides in localizing and integrating the goals into its planning processes; finalized the review of its national development strategy (1997‑2022); and will soon launch a revised national strategy, he said, adding that the latter’s theme will be “sustainable development and inclusive growth”. among other things, he also spotlighted achievements in innovation and research as well as the country’s successful holding of free, fair elections earlier in september."
Ethiopia,"permanent mission of the federal democratic republic of ethiopia to the united nations n+nn*. tflaji 5i& m>mtrtv ft i xfd* fcfl 866 second avenue, 3rd floor • new york, n.y. 10017 remarks by h.e. dr. workneh gebeyehu minister for foreign affairs of the federa democr tic republic of ethiopia at the 73rd session of the united na ions general assemb y 28 september 2018 ' new york madam president, allow me to start by expressing my warmest congratulations to you on your election as president of the 73rd session of the general assembly. i c n assure you of my delegation s fullest support and cooperation in the effective discharge of your responsibilities. let me also convey my sincere appreciation to your predecessor for his able leadership of this august assembly for the past year. this, of course, is a year in which the united nations lost one of its icons someone who rose through the ranks to lead the organization and someone who, as the secretary-general rightly said, truly represented what the united nations is all about. we mourn the loss of this illustrious son of africa who left an enduring mark on the world stage. madam president, we are meeting at a time when multilateralism is facing serious challenges and yet there has never been a time when we need multilateralism more. this is why this gathering of nations under the umbrella of the united nations is so important. it remains the only universal organization whose very ideals of freedom, equality and justice are still as valid today as they were at its inception. as i emperor haile selassie of ethiopia stated in his address to the general assembly in october 1963: the charter of the united nations expresses the noblest aspirations of man: abjuration of force in the settlement of disputes between states; the assurance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion; the safeguarding of international peace and security . this remains profoundly true; and let me take this opportunit today to assure you that ethiopia, as a founding member of the united nations, will continue to adhere to these ideals and to the principles of multilateralism as we face unprecedented challenges and threats to our community of nations. ethiopia s contribution to united nations peacekeeping is second to none. we remain totally committed to this noble endeavor as we reform and adapt to the new and challenging realities of peacekeeping. we fully endorse the secretaty-general’s action for peacekeeping initiative and the declaration of shared commitments to united nations peacekeeping to tackle the challenges peacekeeping faces today. 2 madam presid nt, six months ago, a peaceful transfer of power took place in ethiopia. it has opened a new chapter in our country s political and social history, offering realistic and genuine possibilities of change that will meet the hopes and expectations of our youthful population; changes that are in line with the new political and democratic realities we are implementing; changes that have been welcomed and embraced by ethiopians across the length and breadth of the country. creating a just, peaceful, equitable and sustainable society is the vision we are supporting as we build a new society on the foundations and achievements of the past. it is a vision, i believe, highly appropriate and relevant to our discussion here at this session of the general assembly and of the theme selected for this gener l debate. ethiopia and the people of ethiopia have frequently shown their resilience and strength often enough in the past in times of adversity. we are quite confident we will continue to do so. no difficulties are insurmountable. there are, of course, challenges that we continue to encounter in working to ensure the benefits of economic growth and development are widely shared among all sections of our people. we are working today to widen and deepen the reforms necessary to 3 promote democratic governance and the rule of law; to promote fairness and justice, better financial and economic management; to promote transparency and accountability across the entire administration of governance; to promote popular participation and an effective democracy. in the last six months we have exerted every effort to make sure all this, together with our message of forgiveness and reconciliation strengthens the unity and solidarity of our people. the new government led by prime minister abiy ahmed is taking a series of measures: opening up the democratic space in every direction, opening up the economy, removing previous constraints on development such as corruption, human rights violations, and failures of administration and governance. in other words, we have been, and are continuing, to respond to the hopes and aspirations of our people. these reforms have been welcomed across the country. and, madam president, we have not confined our efforts to ethiopia. another highly important, historic, development is what is happening in our region. in the last three months my prime minister has also launched equally significant reconciliation across the horn of 4 africa region. this is t e start to a real process of normalization between and among the countries of the horn. ethiopia and eritrea have opened a new chapter in their relationship, ending two decades of conflict. we are normalizing relations and charting a future in which our relationship will truly reflect the longstanding ties between our two peoples. somalia and eritrea have reconciled their differences and re-established diplomatic relations. it marks a new relationship between the two countries. early this month, we held a trilateral summit of eritrea, ethiopia and somalia in asmara. we foreign ministers then visited djibouti, opening a new phase in relations between djibouti and eritrea. the au commission chairperson has rightly called this a clear demonstration of the value and effectiveness of the search of african solutions to african problems. recently, my prime minister and the president of eritrea signed a further compressive cooperation agreement in jeddah; and presidents of eritrea and djibouti shook hands in jeddah, ending a decade of dispute. in light of these important and positive developments, it is only appropriate and timely that the security 5 council now seriously considers lifting the sanctions imposed on eritrea. a few days ago, the south sudanese parties signed the revitalized peace agreement for south sudan at an extraordinary summit of igad heads of state and government in addis ababa. this offers the real prospect for peace in south sudan after five years of civil war. madam president, these are major developments in the horn of africa. this is as the secretary-general put it, a powerful wind of hope blowing across the horn of africa. it is a wind that offers a ""start to unraveling years of conflict and suspicion across the region - a region which has been one of the most conflict-ridden in africa, horn of africa is indeed becoming hope of africa. while all these major steps towards ""silencing the guns in our region is taking place, it is equally important to extend the process to promote a framework for regional economic integration to fight poverty. equally regional economic cooperation will make a real contribution to help rid of violence and war as well as promote ""deeper regional and continental integration in line with agenda 2063.” 6 in light of the challenges we face together as a region, the choice we have is very clear. the historic, cultural, social and linguistic links that bind our peoples form a proper basis to strive for common prosperity. we believe regional integration, which benefits all countries of the horn, is the only viable option we have for meaningful development. we are already seeing dividends through regional integration projects. we are now working to accelerate such efforts, building on what we have already achieved. finally, madam president, let me underline that ethiopia is, and will always remain, firmly committed to exerting every possible effort towards creating peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies in our sub-region and our continent africa. as a non-permanent member of the security council, we have been doing everything we can to support this important and noble cause and we will continue to do so in the spirit and commitment of nurturing peace, security and stability for the common good of our countries. i thank you 7","workineh gebeyehu negewo, minister for foreign affairs of ethiopia, stressed that amid serious challenges multilateralism is needed more than ever, adding that the united nations is the only universal organization represents the same ideals today as it did at its inception: freedom, equality and justice. ethiopia is a founding united nations member; its contribution to peacekeeping is second to none and it fully endorses the secretary-general’s action for peacekeeping initiative and the declaration of shared commitments to united nations peacekeeping. the peaceful power transfer that took place six months ago in ethiopia opened a new chapter in the country’s political and social history, offering realistic and genuine possibilities of change that will meet the hopes and expectations of youth and that have been embraced by ethiopians nationwide. highlighting the strength and resilience of ethiopians in times of adversity, he made clear that “no difficulties are insurmountable”. reforms necessary to promote democratic governance and the rule of law, fairness and justice, better financial and economic management, transparency and accountability are under way. “in the last six months we have exerted every effort to make sure all this, together with our message of forgiveness and reconciliation, strengthens the unity and solidarity of our people,” he said. turning to the horn of africa, he noted the launch of reconciliation across the region, thus starting a real process of normalization, pointing to the end of the two decades of conflict between ethiopia and eritrea and the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between eritrea and somalia. furthermore, a trilateral summit among eritrea, ethiopia and somalia was held in asmara earlier in the month, followed by a visit to djibouti, a clear demonstration of the value and effectiveness of african solutions to african problems. recently, ethiopia and eritrea signed a further comprehensive agreement. “in light of these important and positive developments, it is only appropriate and timely that the security council now seriously considers lifting the sanctions imposed on eritrea,” he said. such major developments offer “a start to unraveling years of conflict and suspicion across the region”, he said, adding: “a region which has been one of the most conflict-ridden in africa, horn of africa is indeed becoming hope of africa.” it is equally important to extend the process to promote a regional economic integration framework to fight poverty, which will both help rid violence and war as well as promote deeper regional and continental integration in line with agenda 2063. regional integration is the only viable option for meaningful development, he said, as the historic, cultural, social and linguistic links that bind the people of the region form a proper basis to strive for common prosperity. lastly, he reaffirmed his support as a non-permanent member of the security council in the efforts of creating peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies on the african continent."
European Union,"press council of the eu en speech 530/18 27/09/2018 address by president donald tusk to the 73rd united nations general assembly the european union is fighting intensely to preserve the rules-based international order, which is currently under great strain, in terms of trade, security, climate change or human rights. we say this not only as countries strongly supporting the united nations, but as a continent that cares deeply about respect, mutual understanding and solidarity between nations. as leaders, we must equip the united nations with the means to fulfill its mandate successfully. more unity and collective action are needed in the struggle against conflict, poverty and famine, terrorism and mass displacement of people, of the kind we see in venezuela, syria, myanmar and many other places. to that end, the european union firmly supports the current effort to reform the un. these reforms are badly needed and overdue. the urgency is clear and implementation is essential. the european union is taking on more responsibility for security matters. we have initiated ambitious co-operation among our own militaries. we are ready to step-up help to our neighbors through crisis management missions, capacity building and peacekeeping, in cooperation with others, including nato, the african union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce). the union also supports the action for peacekeeping initiative and expects it to produce more effective and better resourced global security solutions. europe has undertaken action against the increased use of disinformation and outside propaganda in open democratic elections. the anonymity of cyberspace is used by external actors to cloak malicious political interference. it is not just europe's problem; many others here today are similarly affected. the united nations should help expose this phenomenon, attribute responsibility and increase democratic resilience. one hundred years since nelson mandela's birth, we remember his triumph over apartheid in south africa. i am very pleased that this occasion has also coincided with deeper ties between the african and european unions. the summit of our both unions in abidjan last november was key. thanks to the excellent cooperation between the african union, the european union and the united nations we have until today helped over 30.000 people to leave libya through voluntary humanitarian returns. we want to expand the work with our partners in other areas. therefore, education, investment in development, climate change and free trade will be at the heart of our future relations. africa is a continent of great challenges but it is also a continent of equally great opportunities. instability in libya has brought the world's attention to the suffering caused by human smugglers and traffickers who take brutal advantage of people and weaken the states in which they operate. the security council named some of worst violators last june. they and those like them, should be sanctioned, apprehended and brought to justice. in the meantime, the european union will work diligently and in good faith with our north african partners on search and rescue efforts in the mediterranean. only collective responsibility can offer effective solutions to global phenomena such as migration and forced displacement. and i truly hope that the recent un debates on the future governance of migration and refugee protection represent a step in the right direction. the european union leads global resettlement efforts, including through resettlement from turkey, which is hosting refugees displaced by the fighting in syria, as are jordan and lebanon. the syrian people are suffering as the war continues. the memorandum of understanding on idlib needs to be fully implemented to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. all parties must respect international humanitarian law, ensure the protection of civilians, and allow aid to reach those in need. a meaningful political process under the united nations auspices is especially needed to bring about a resolution to the conflict. sustainable development and increasing continent-to-continent connectivity will bring countries, people and societies closer together. these priorities will be crucial in our future relations with africa and also at the next month's asia-europe meeting, which i will be hosting in brussels. they go hand in hand with the implementation of the paris agreement on climate change, and with other international commitments. from floods to fires, the impact of climate change becomes more visible every year, and sadly, we are now measuring the impact in loss of human life. and still, even though only slow progress is being made on our main task, namely to implement the paris agreement, the european union remains fully committed to it and makes it a priority in its relations with our partners. and when we talk about the environment, let me use this occasion to appeal to all the leaders to undertake action to protect the waters around the antarctic. there is still time to save the natural habitat of many endangered species by establishing maritime sanctuaries in the southern ocean. let me say it loud and clear: those who can imagine our planet without whales, penguins and other species will also have to imagine our planet without humans. non-proliferation is another global challenge we face but here, things are looking up thanks to multilateral action on sanctions. on the korean peninsula, a year ago the situation was critical. although much depends on the attitude of the democratic people's republic of korea (dprk), we have seen that diplomacy can open the way to more comprehensive solutions. a similar situation exists with the joint comprehensive plan of action with iran. while addressing nuclear issues, the deal has also helped to create space for dialog on other concerns, like iran's regional behavior and ballistic missile programs. the agreement is good for european, regional and global security. that is why the european union is committed to maintaining the agreement, as long as iran remains fully committed to it. a while ago, i mentioned the one hundredth birthday anniversary of nelson mandela. in the coming hours, the seventy fifth birthday anniversary will be celebrated by another nobel peace prize winner, a great pole, lech wałęsa. they are both symbols of a beautiful cause: how to win without violence, how to forgive our oppressors, and how in public life, to overcome evil with good. today, when so many people, also here in this hall, including even the most powerful world leaders, are starting to give up on freedom, solidarity and democracy, let us remember mandela's and wałęsa's message. and that, regardless of how difficult their situation was, they never capitulated in their fight. thank you. press office - general secretariat of the council rue de la loi 175 - b-1048 brussels - tel.: +32 (0)2 281 6319 press.office@consilium.europa.eu - www.consilium.europa.eu/press","donald tusk, president of european council of the european union, said his bloc was fighting to protect the international world‑based order which is currently under great strain. the countries of the european continent care about respect and solidarity between nations, as well as unity and collective action in addressing the pressing issues before the united nations. the european union supports the plans to reform the united nations, reforms that are long overdue, he observed. the union has stepped up efforts to maintain peace and security in europe and has taken action against the increased use of disinformation in elections. the anonymity of cyberspace allows nefarious actions to be disguised and the united nations should help expose this phenomenon. increased relations between the european union and the african union has allowed the european union to help people to safely leave libya, adding that the two organizations will continue that productive cooperation. regarding the migration crisis, only collective action will solve the situation. the european union will continue to work with partners on search and rescue efforts in the mediterranean. the bloc is also involved in resettlement efforts including syrian refugees from turkey, he said, calling for the full implementation of the idlib agreement and for all to respect international law. sustainable development and continent‑to‑continent activity will bring societies closer together, he said, pointing out that climate change will be one of the most important issues the world faces. he appealed to all leaders to protect the waters around the antarctic. as well, by establishing maritime sanctuaries in the southern ocean, many species of wildlife will be saved. regarding nonproliferation, he observed that the situation has improved, although much depends on the attitude of the democratic people’s republic of korea. clearly, diplomacy is the productive way forward. a similar situation exists in iran, where the european union is committed to the joint comprehensive plan of action, as long as iran remains committed to it. recalling the late former president of south africa, nelson mandela’s message, he urged members not to give up."
Fiji,"f l-j i the president of the general assembly, the secretary general of the united nations, excellencies, distinguished delegates. bula vinaka and a very good day to you all. madame president, allow me to congratulate you on assuming the presidency of this i'i""^ session of the general assembly. every year brings fresh challenges and new crises, even as the crises of last year and the year before await some resolution, or even some respite. this body—the united nations—is continually challenged to stand between parties in conflict, to ease the suffering of refugees and migrants, and to continue its work to build a more peaceful, just and equal world. the fijian people have always been proud of our nation's full engagement with the united nations. we have been a willing and energetic presence in peacekeeping efforts around the world. and we are now proudly putting every ounce of energy we have into the fight to save this planet and its people—all of us—from a catastrophic warming of our climate. madame president, fiji will soon celebrate national elections for the second time since our return to democracy. i say celebrate with a purpose, because truly free elections are the very starting point for democracy and freedom. if the people cannot choose their government freely, then their other freedoms are always in jeopardy. i am proud of what we have accomplished in our fijian democracy. where we once had only the shell of democracy, we have now pierced that shell, and we have brought the fijian people into a genuinely inclusive society in which minority rights are respected and all citizens are equal not just in name, but in fact. that is the great promise of the 2013 fijian constitution, which has been the beacon for our progress through its vast array of political and socio economic protections for every fijian. today in fiji and forever, we make no distinctions based on ethnicity, social status or religion, and we enforce our laws that guarantee that equality. we have reinforced our democracy by passing laws to empower girls and women and protect them from violence. we have reformed our education system so that it provides real opportunity for all fijians, regardless of income and regardless of whether they live in the capital or the most remote islands and regardless of gender. this year, we achieved an over 90 per cent level of literacy in the country, over 90 per cent of girls in fiji complete 15 years of secondary education, and just under 90 per cent of our boys do the same. we are building our future on this firm foundation of education. we have also reformed our welfare programs to provide not just a stronger safety net, but also to create greater opportunity for the most vulnerable in our society. so while we provide free medicines and subsidized electricity, we also award grants to micro businesses as a way of lifting people out of poverty and rewarding and encouraging self-reliance and entrepreneurship. this approach goes beyond mere government programs for the disadvantaged, madame president. it is based on a fundamental principle that the socio-economic rights of all fijians must be protected. those include the right to a quality education, the right to receive treatment and medication when they are ill, the right to decent housing, the right to clean water and electricity, and the right to transportation that is affordable and accessible. we have also strengthened our independent institutions—our judiciary and the independent commissions that protect consumers,fight corruption, provide legal assistance, advocate and promote human rights and carry out many of the activities of government that must be free of political considerations. i may be disappointed at times when my government loses a case in court, but those defeats are signs of strong, independent institutions, something that we must support and reinforce. they serve to strengthen the people's belief that everyone in fiji can get justice. if people believe in the courts, they will go to the courts to settle their disputes, and they will trust the courts to adjudicate without fear or favor. there is no doubt that the fijian people have a strong and abiding love for freedom. we want to live free. and we see freedom, democracy and—perhaps most important of all—tolerance as powerful forces for peace in the world. it is with this clearly demonstrated vocation for personal freedom, tolerance, and social justice that fiji is a candidate during this general assembly for membership on the united nations human rights council. we have thought hard about human rights and taken actions to be a better nation, a nation that encourages respect for the dignity of every person. and we look forward to bringing that point of view to the critical work of the council. fiji looks to a future free of racism, nepotism and privilege. a future where the rights of all persons are guaranteed and enforced by a robust constitutional framework that reaffirms and protects civil and political rights as well as social, cultural and economic rights. madame president, our value to the human rights council is also underpinned by our long experience in peacekeeping. it was exactly 40 years ago when fiji first participated in un peacekeeping. over those 40 years, which have seen fijians serving in africa, the sinai, east timor and throughout the middle east, we have come to identify ourselves as a peacekeeping nation, and it makes us proud. it is something we offer to the global community, to our fellow human beings. also in those 40 years, we have witnessed first-hand the way intolerance embraces and leads to repression, violence and mass migration. we have had our experience with intolerance in fiji. it was an ugly experience that corroded our trust in each other and our sense of who we are as a people. we must remember it so that we do not repeat it, and we will never stop working to keep it in our past. madame president, i am proud to stand before you and report that fiji is in its ninth year.of strong economic growth, i believe that is due in no small part to the democratization that has taken root and is flourishing. democracy is based on a belief in the people, in the belief that everyone is capable of great things if only they are given equal opportunity. when people see that they have opportunity, that they can get justice, that they can speak their minds and be heard, and that their hard work will be rewarded, they invest their money and their sweat in their future and in greater possibilities for their children. they stay at home and contribute rather than emigrate. and they feel free to let their hopes and ambitions soar. and that drives a thriving economy. but that optimism must be nurtured and supported through intelligent government actions. in fiji, we have reformed the tax laws to make them simpler and more just. as a part of that, we have begun rigorously enforcing our tax laws to ease the burden on those who have little and to ensure that whoever needs to pay, pays their fair share. people who take risks and mount successful businesses should enjoy the fruits of their hard work, but they must also do their part to sustain the nation. tax cheating is an offense against the people, and we will root it out and penalize it wherever it exists. we have also reformed our state enterprises to make them profitable and efficient. the people of fiji and the employees of these companies have been the main beneficiaries, because better capitalisation and better management has produced better service, increased investments, and higher wages. we also see small and medium-sized enterprises as important ways of promoting growth and lifting people out of poverty. i am proud to say that my government has given grants worth 32.4 million dollars to small and micro enterprises, and we have been rewarded with explosive growth and extraordinary innovation in that sector. a free people, madame president, need an economic structure that serves them and makes them optimistic. it is one of the basic pillars of democracy. madame president, fiji is coming to the end of its presidency of cop23,of the united nations' ongoing climate negotiations among the nations of the world, but the struggle to fight global warming and to end the degradation of our oceans will continue to be fiji's highest priority. the many disastrous effects of climate change that we are seeing in the south pacific or around the world are well-documented. the same can be said of the enormous stresses on our oceans arsing from acidification, overfishing, warming and plastic refuse. the time to debate those facts is long past. as the fijian prime minister, 1 meet thousands of fijian women, men and children every year who have suffered from the latest wave of climate-related impacts; the cyclones, the flooding, the prolonged droughts, and the steadily rising seas. 1 meet with the farmers whose crops have been washed away, the teachers and students who have lost their schools and the families whose homes have been destroyed. they want their prime minister to demand that the world take action on their behalf. the commitments we have all made through our nationally determined contributions or ndcs fall woefully short of the mark. they simply will not get us to the goal of the paris agreement of reducing the rate of global warming to well below 2 degrees celsius target —let alone the more ambitious target of 1.5 degrees. what matters now, madame president, is action. fiji will press for more action on climate change and ocean health in every forum that we are a part of. we can't simply wait on the rest of the world, with climate impacts already bearing down upon us. we are already taking steps to boost our resilience. fiji has begun a project to improve access to sustainable water supply and sewerage services to approximately 270,000 fijians. we will provide cyclone insurance coverage for low-income households. we are relocating entire villages and communities to escape the rising seas. we're rebuilding our infrastructure back from cyclones to a higher, far more resilient standard. we're working to protect communities that face unacceptably high risks of flooding. fiji became the first emerging market to issue a sovereign green bond to fund such activities. but, madame president, no government alone can combat climate change. the challenge is simply too great. that is why, from the beginning of fiji's presidency of cop23, 1 have sought to build a grand coalition of governments, the private sector, labor, religious groups and civil society to take initiative and bring forth ideas and solutions great and small. madame president, 1 am confident that 1 speak for all fijians and all pacific islanders when 1 say that 1 lose patience with national leaders who proclaim their deep concern over climate change and then do little or nothing to lead their nations on a more ambitious path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. leaders who ignore this threat and give their people new coal-fired power plants instead of a better future for their children are either tragically short-sighted or simply engaging in a most cynical form of betrayal. and their people—all people—^will bear the burden. madame president, the world has embraced the pacific tradition of talanoa - a tradition of open and honest dialog, it will help to raise our collective ambition. but ambition without action—without a plan—is just talk. the talanoa dialogs will reach a crescendo in katowice at cop24. we cannot let katowice fail. katowice cannot became another copenhagen. madame president, we are not only calling on other to act - we are leading from the front. earlier this week, i announced that fiji will commit to significantly raising its ndc. fiji will be a net-zero greenhouse gas emission country by 2050. madame president, fiji is proud to have launched the ocean pathway partnership with the government of sweden. we know that the interaction of ocean ecology and climate change is so profound. we cannot attempt to solve the crisis of one without confronting the crisis of the other. our oceans are suffering from the stress of human activities that go beyond climate change, including pollution, overfishing and acidification. madame president, 1 draw the world's serious attention to the need to help developing nations— particularly the most disadvantaged and vulnerable to overcome climate and oceans stresses. they need access to finance, they need practical solutions. they need the united nations to help them get there. madame president, it has been an honor for fiji—and for me personally—^to lead the united nations efforts on climate change this year. 1 am proud of what we have accomplished. the world has never needed the united nations more. the existential problem of climate change requires us to work together. the challenge of mobilizing finance for climate resilience requires us to work together. more complex and more globalized conflicts require us to work together. madam president , fiji is firmly committed to the united nations. we need the united nations to be at its best of we are to have any chance of overcoming the grave challenges that fiji and the world now confront. vinaka vakalevu. thank you.","josaia voreqe bainimarama, prime minister of fiji, spotlighting his country’s willing and energetic contribution to united nations peacekeeping operations, said it is also “putting every ounce of energy we have into the fight to save this planet and its people” from the catastrophic impacts of climate change. expressing pride in fiji’s democratic process and its inclusive society, he highlighted its high literacy rate and strong social safety nets in particular. meanwhile, the government awards micro‑business grants in order to lift people out of poverty and reward and encourage self‑reliance and entrepreneurship. fiji has also strengthened its independent institutions, he continued, noting that they protect consumers, fight corruption, provide legal assistance and advocate for and promote human rights. tolerance and personal freedom are also critical principles for the fijian people, he said, adding that they drove its decision to seek membership on the human rights council in an upcoming session. “fiji looks to a future free of racism, nepotism and privilege,” he said, calling for all people to be guaranteed their rights and protected by robust constitutional frameworks. recalling that fiji has seen first‑hand how intolerance leads to repression, violence and mass migration, he said its own ugly historical experience corroded peoples’ trust in each other and their sense in who they were as a nation. “we must remember it so that we do not repeat it, and we will never stop working to keep it in our past,” he said. today, fiji is in its ninth year of strong economic growth, due in large part to the democracy that has taken root and is flourishing. “when people see that they have opportunity, that they can get justice, that they can speak their minds and be heard […] they invest their money and sweat in their futures and in greater possibilities for their children,” he stressed. however, he continued, that optimism must be nurtured and supported through intelligent government actions. fiji has reformed its tax laws to make them simpler and more just and is working to ease the burden on those who have little, ensuring that everyone pays their fair share. also spotlighting critical government support to small‑ and medium‑sized enterprises — resulting in explosive growth and extraordinary innovation in that sector — he went on to describe the disastrous impacts of climate change on his country. crops have been washed away and homes destroyed. in that regard, he outlined national mitigation efforts, voicing impatience over other world leaders “who proclaim their deep concern […] and then do little or nothing”. fiji will be a net‑zero greenhouse‑gas emitter by 2050, he stressed, urging other nations to commit to the same goal."
Finland,"73^^ session of the united nations general assembly general debate statement of finland by h.e. mr. sauli niinisto, president of the republic of finland new york, 25 september 2018 () permanei'jt misb.. , ; ..jland to the united naiiunb. new york madam president, secretary-general, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, i congratulate you. madam president, on your election as president of the 73rd session of the general assembly. i also wish to pay tribute to secretary-general antonio guterres for his vision in leading the united nations. finland wholeheartedly supports both of you in your important tasks. madam president, my country has always been a strong advocate of multilateral cooperation. for finland, a rules-based international order is of fundamental importance. at home, being able to rely on commonly agreed rules is a cornerstone of our own national security and welfare. on the global level, common solutions and rules are needed to address the most pressing challenges of our time. unfortunately, there is now reason to be worried for all of us who believe in the benefits of multilateralism. the international system we have built together is visibly under pressure. its capability and credibility are questioned. we can no longer take the rules-based order for granted. it is our common responsibility to actively defend and develop it. finland sees the united nations as the core of the multilateral system. therefore the defense of multilateralism must begin here. the un and its members need to show their will to act together, not past each other. we fully support the secretary-general's ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda. now is the time to implement these reforms. we must ensure that the un of the future is more transparent, accountable and efficient. in order for the united nations to be credible, it has to practice what it preaches. for any organization, every single case of sexual exploitation in its own ranks is a case too much. this is particularly true for an organization stressing the importance of equality and human rights. i am proud to be a member of the circle of leadership and i welcome the efforts taken to prevent and combat ail forms of abuse throughout the un system. madam president, the three pillars of the un - peace and security, human rights and development - have stood the test of time. but we have also discovered that many of the present global challenges do not respect the boundaries between them. the pillars are increasingly interlinked, as are the challenges themselves. the most important achievements of the un system in recent years are testimony to this. i am thinking of the agenda 2030, the paris agreement, and the global compacts on migration and refugees. issues like sustainability, climate change and migration are not only about development and human rights. they are also essential questions of peace and security. climate change is the prime example of the need for prompt global action. the upcoming report of the ipcc will further underscore the urgency of our response. it will also show how much remains to be done. so far, the voluntary contributions from the state parties to the paris agreement are not enough to keep the global temperature rise well below two degrees celsius. we must do a lot more, and more quickly. in the north, we are witnessing how the arctic region is warming with an alarming pace. this is not just a regional problem, as it poses a threat to the entire global climate system. one important factor in accelerating the melting of sea ice in the arctic are black carbon emissions. reducing black carbon that lands on the white ice would have immediate positive effects to prevent melting. a commitment to curb those emissions would be a key objective of an arctic summit that finland, as the current chair of the arctic council, is ready to host. left unchecked, climate change will also lead to a further increase in migration flows. already now, some 65 million people across the world are displaced - the highest figure since the second world war. some hundred million people worldwide are in urgent need of basic humanitarian assistance, and the number is growing. there are no quick and easy solutions, but doing nothing is not an option. i therefore welcome the global compact on migration and i look fonward to participating in the conference to adopt it in marrakech in december. madam president, full-scale wars, conflicts of varying intensity, and breaches of international law continue to haunt us. they constantly remind us of the immense human suffering involved. we, the international community, need to remain persistent in our efforts to solve ongoing conflicts, regardless of how deep-rooted and long-lasting they may be. on a positive note, we have been encouraged by recent attempts to arrive at a genuine dialog between the democratic people's republic of korea and the international community.the momentum to take steps towards a peaceful korean peninsula should be maintained and supported. a successful outcome in that region could set a powerful example for non-proliferation and disarmament elsewhere, too. where peace has been achieved, the relevance of un peacekeeping remains beyond doubt. butthe blue helmets will also need to adapt to changing realities. we support the secretarygeneral's action for peacekeeping initiative in making un peacekeeping more effective. while existing conflicts need to be solved, our priority must be preventing future ones. finland welcomes the efforts to strengthen the un's conflict prevention capacity. in conflict prevention, mediation is an invaluable tool. it is vital for the future of mediation that experience gained in the past is passed on to future mediators. it was an honor for my country to host the meeting of the secretary-general's high-level advisory board on mediation in june in finland. we remain strong supporters of the mediation activities of the un and other actors. where appropriate, finland also continues to offer its good services to facilitate concrete discussions between parties, from track-2 negotiations to high-level meetings. madam president, peace and security, human rights and development are not sustainable without the participation of women and the youth. female voices and young voices must be heard - and acted upon. the needs of women, children and youth are still all too often marginalized in peace talks. finland promotes the role of women's effective participation in peace processes through the nordic network of women mediators. this and other similar networks provide a useful platform for advocacy and self-education. as a heforshe impact champion, i highly value these efforts. as we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, its importance in the international order deserves special attention. human rights not only protect the individual, they also help us prevent conflicts, build sustained peace and speed up development. ifwe are serious about human rights, accountability mechanisms for crimes against international law are needed. perpetrators must be brought to justice. finland appeals to all member states and the secretary-general to consistently keep human rights, non-discrimination and gender equality on top of the agenda of the un. madam president, it was with profound sadness that i learned of the passing of mr. kofi annan, former secretary-general of the un. his legacy is an inspiration for us all. iwould like to conclude by remembering these words from him: ""more than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. we can master it only if we face it together. and that, my friends, is why we have the united nations."" thank you.","sauli niinistö, president of finland, voiced strong support for multilateral cooperation while warning that there is reason to be worried for all those who believe in its benefits. the international system is visibly under pressure and its capability and credibility are being questioned. countries can no longer take the international rules-based order for granted. “it is our common responsibility to actively defend and develop it,” he said, describing the united nations as the core of that system and urging its member states to show their will to act together — “not past each other”. while expressing support for the secretary-general’s reform agenda, aimed at ensuring that the united nations of the future is more transparent, accountable and efficient, he underscored that the organization must practice what it preaches for it to be credible. any case of sexual exploitation among the united nations own ranks is one case too many. in addition, many of today’s global challenges cross the boundaries between the pillars of peace and security, human rights and development, and many of the organization’s recent achievements — including the 2030 agenda, the paris agreement on climate change and the global compacts on migration and refugees — reflect that interlinked nature. however, more action is still needed on those issues, including efforts to ensure that global temperature rise is kept to well below 2°c. “in the north, we are witnessing how the arctic region is warming at an alarming pace,” he said, emphasizing that the challenge was not just a regional one but also a threat to the entire global climate system. left unchecked, climate change will also lead to a further increase in migration flows, adding to the 65 million people who are already displaced. full-scale wars, conflicts of varying intensity and breaches of international law continue, he said. urging the international community to remain persistent in their effort to resolve such conflicts, he nevertheless spotlighted positive developments including a genuine dialog between the democratic people’s republic of korea and the international community, bringing momentum towards a peaceful korean peninsula. “a successful outcome in that region could set a powerful example for non-proliferation and disarmament elsewhere, too.” turning to peacekeeping, he said the relevance of united nations blue helmets remains beyond doubt. however, they also need to adapt to changing realities, he said, expressing support for the secretary-general’s action for peacekeeping initiative to make united nations peacekeeping more effective. while mediation is a valuable conflict prevention tool, peace and security, human rights and development are not sustainable without the participation of women and youth. “female voices and young voices must be heard and acted upon,” he stressed, highlighting the work of the nordic network of women mediators and its support for related global campaigns such as the united nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women’s (un-women) heforshe initiative."
France,"seventy-third united nations general assembly – speech by m. emmanuel macron, president of the republic new york, 25 september 2018 mr president of the united nations general assembly, mr secretary-general, heads of state and government, ladies and gentlemen, un role all of us here have inherited a tremendous hope, that of saving future generations from the scourge of war, of building a world order based on law and on keeping promises, of helping humanity move forward towards economic, social and moral progress, with freedom that is increasingly guaranteed. and we have made progress: human rights have spread, trade and prosperity have been expanded, poverty has been reduced. this is what we have achieved over the last few decades. however, we must examine the period we are going through with a clear head. we are currently experiencing a deep crisis of the westphalian liberal world order that we have known. firstly, because it has failed in part to regulate itself. its economic, financial, environmental and climate-related failings have not yet been satisfactorily resolved. secondly, because our collective capacity to respond to crises is still all too often hampered by divisions in the security council. our organization is all too often limited to deploring the violations of rights that it had sworn to guarantee. seventy years after the adoption of the declaration of human rights by this assembly in paris, cultural, historical, and religious relativism is now calling into question the foundations of their universality. born out of hope, the un may become, like the league of nations that preceded it, a symbol of powerlessness. and there is no need to look for those responsible for this disintegration; they are here, in this assembly. they are speaking today. it’s we, the leaders, who are responsible. based on this observation, we essentially have three main paths forward. the first involves seeing this as a moment, an interlude in history before things return to normal. i do not believe this. i do not believe this because we are currently experiencing a crisis of the effectiveness and principles of our contemporary world order which will not be able to get back on track or return to how it functioned before. the period we are going through is not an interlude: it reflects our own past deficiencies. the second path forward would be based on a survival-of-the-fittest approach, the temptation for everyone to follow their own laws. what i am saying is that this path of unilateralism leads us directly to withdrawal and conflict, to widespread confrontation between everyone, to the detriment of all - even, eventually, of those who believe they are the 2 strongest. we have a joint responsibility for peace; it cannot be delegated, cannot be refused, cannot be pre-empted. a survival-of-the-fittest approach does not protect any group of people against any kind of threat, whether chemical or nuclear. iran what will make it possible to truly resolve the situation in iran and what has already started to help stabilize it? a survival-of-the-fittest approach, pressure from a single stakeholder? no! we know that iran was on the path towards military nuclear capability, but what stopped it? the agreement brokered in vienna in 2015. as i said a year ago, we should not exacerbate regional tensions, but rather propose a broader agenda that will make it possible to address all nuclear, ballistic and regional concerns caused by iranian policies, through dialog and multilateralism. without being naïve or complacent, but without any posturing, which will certainly be pointless in the end. trade what will resolve the problem of trade imbalances and all of their consequences on our societies? common rules adapted to today’s reality that will make it possible to establish the conditions for equal and fair competition, and not, under any circumstances, the bilateral treatment of all our trade disputes or a new form of protectionism. middle east conflict what will make it possible to resolve the crisis between israel and palestine? not unilateral initiatives, or ignoring the legitimate rights of the palestinians to achieve sustainable peace, or underestimating the legitimate right of israelis to their security. there is no other credible alternative to the solution of two states living side by side in peace and security, with jerusalem as their capital. israel knows that france is a true friend and it is in the name of this friendship that i call on it to swiftly put an end to the fait accompli policy which threatens the very possibility of achieving a peace deal. to continue along this path would be a mistake. “new world balance” on this issue, i am ready, and we must be ready, to abandon the dogmas, the longstanding positions, to take new initiatives, provided that this leads to positive changes on the ground. a survival-of-the-fittest approach will only serve to increase frustrations and violence. as you will have understood, in the face of the current imbalances, i do not believe in a survival-of-the-fittest approach even if it were disguised as some form of legitimacy, when in reality it has lost any kind of legality. i believe in a third way forward for us, undoubtedly the most difficult, undoubtedly the most challenging, requiring us to forge together a new model, to find together a new world balance. because after a form of superpower model, we have been experiencing for several years now a new form of global instability, marked by the return of multiple powers. the new equilibrium that we must create must be based on new forms of regional and international cooperation and will, i believe, be based on three principles: firstly, respect for sovereignty, which is at the very foundation of our charter; secondly, the strengthening of our regional cooperation; and thirdly, the provision of more robust international guarantees. and it 3 is through this method, based on these three principles, that we must ensure we can resolve the current crisis situations. syria therefore, in syria, we are continuing the fight against islamist terrorism. the military engagement of certain countries has allowed the regime to re-establish itself, resulting in crimes for which the perpetrators will one day be held accountable. the syrian people have tragically paid the price, and there can be no victors in a syria in ruins. what we have to do now is restore peace under un auspices. it is not up to us to decide for the syrian people, but to develop the ways and means to implement this method that i have just described and therefore to develop a solution that is backed, not just by the guarantor states in the astana process, but by other states in the region and the international community through the small group, under the coordination of the united nations and the special representative of the secretary-general, in order to resolve the humanitarian crisis on the one hand and, on the other hand, to build an inclusive, lasting political solution through constitutional reform and the holding of free elections. this is what truly respecting syrian sovereignty means! it does not mean deciding on behalf of the syrian people who should be their leader or agreeing to cover up all of the crimes by allowing this leader to remain until the end of time, on the basis that we no longer have any principles, or, basically, any rights. libya and again in libya, this new method should make it possible to bring about a lasting solution. the current status quo enables the militias, the traffickers to gain ground, destabilizing the entire region. we will not give the libyan people the means to resolve the situation if we remain divided, if libya becomes the battleground, as it still too often is, for confrontation between foreign influences. in paris, the libyans pledged to swiftly hold elections, which will make it possible to reunify state institutions. these commitments must be fulfilled under the auspices of the united nations, with close cooperation from the african union. yesterday an important step was taken, one that i would like to applaud. it is in the libyan people’s interest and in that of their neighbors, the europeans and the international community, which must unite around these goals in order to move forward. sahel all together we are strong in the face of terrorism when states can count on their own forces to guarantee their security, and also when that security is based on regional and international solutions, according to the principle i have just elucidated. that is the decision taken by the sahel nations, which are working together within the g5 force. that is the point of the process launched by the african union to better shoulder its responsibilities through african peace operations. that is the point of the initiatives being taken in the lake chad region, which are also being shepherded by nigeria, chad and cameroon and supported by the african union. 4 that is why we must support this african union initiative and push for better coordination between the african union and the united nations. i hope that by the end of the year a resolution can be adopted to that effect. we are strong in the face of terrorism when together we assume our responsibilities for combating all its methods of financing; when – as we are doing in the sahel alliance – we are capable of working together to foster development, agriculture and education, to eradicate the roots of the despair that has allowed terrorists to capture people’s souls. $7.5 billion has now been allocated to 500 projects that were jointly defined with all the relevant nations and the partners in the sahel alliance. it is these initial results that we must consolidate. you can see that in each of these crises, the answer was not to leave states on their own, not to take their place or to tell them from here what the law or solution is, but rather to conscientiously articulate the principle of the sovereignty of peoples, of regional cooperation and of a true commitment by the international community. these things form a triptych on which contemporary solutions are built. only collective action makes it possible to preserve the sovereignty and equality of the people who have given us a mandate. it is this same imperative we must champion in the face of the demographic, climate and digital challenges awaiting us, which none of us can confront alone. migration faced with the great challenge of migration, i do not believe in talk of unconditional openness – it only produces worry and heightens intolerance. nor do i believe the lies of those who claim, for example, that in europe and elsewhere they will be stronger if they take shelter behind closed borders. that is not true. the only effective way to manage the migratory flows affecting all of our continents in an orderly, controlled fashion is to create the conditions for a type of international mobility that is freely chosen, not imposed; to work together, whether we are countries of origin, of transit or of destination, to tackle the deep causes of such migration, especially when it is imposed; to dismantle networks of traffickers, which are the worst scourge in this situation; and to protect our borders in a respectful way while ensuring compliance with international law, and in particular the unconditional protection of those who have the right to asylum. that is what we decided to do together in the un compact that will be adopted in marrakesh this december, and which i support. climate/digital world when it comes to climate disruption, there are no free-riders or easy solutions either. even those who dispute the reality suffer the consequences like everybody else. extreme weather is now a daily occurrence. those who undermine collective action are only exposing themselves to a greater degree. when it comes to the great digital transformation, here too it is our duty to stand together to establish contemporary rules that will make it possible to reconcile the 5 development of artificial intelligence with our ethical rules, to guide the digital transformation of our societies. multilateralism you see, my dear friends, i believe deeply in the sovereignty of peoples, which today is strong and present, and demanded by all of our people on the international stage. but at the same time i believe in a strengthened cooperation taking multiple forms and in the renewed legitimacy of international engagement in this context. the great battle of our forerunners was the fight for peace, which is still incumbent upon us. we will only win that battle in the 21st century by restoring a strong multilateral system capable of resolving conflicts in a pragmatic manner, but also and more broadly by tackling the causes of these disturbances. to be honest, i don’t believe in one great globalized people. not at all – it is utopian, there is no such thing. but i do believe in universal values, and on this point we must not back down, it is not the same thing! i believe in the non-negotiable defense of our values, human rights, the dignity of individuals, gender equality. i believe in our ability to establish equilibriums that are respectful of people and cultures, with no haggling about their universality – they are the reality! and in no way will i yield the principle of the sovereignty of peoples to nationalists or to those in the international community who advocate retreating inwards, who want to use the sovereignty of peoples to attack the universality of our values their strength is what keeps us all here in this room! inequalities all of us here, even those who make a point of criticizing it, benefit from the structuring of the international order that went hand in hand with globalization. now we must tackle the deep causes of our imbalances, we must look together at the weaknesses of our international order and – beyond the crises i’ve just mentioned – look at the deep inequalities that have set in. for me, this is the crux of our problem today: what is rekindling nationalism and doubts about our assembly? what is generating crises everywhere? these deep inequalities that we have been unable to resolve. ten years ago, when the financial crisis broke out, we took emergency measures but we did not solve the deepest problem, we did not curb the trend towards the hyper-concentration of wealth on our planet and we did not really provide an answer to all those who were left behind by globalization. all those who were marginalized and frustrated by the humiliations they had suffered harbored a despair whose price we are collectively paying today. we owe all these fellow citizens an answer. we owe an answer, my friends, to the 265 million children, more than half of whom live in sub-saharan africa, who have no access to schooling; to the girls who enjoy fair access to education in less than 40 percent of all countries. we owe an answer to the 700 million children who live in the regions most exposed to the effects of climate change, who are the victims of floods, drought, rising waters, diminishing resources. 6 we owe an answer to the 200 million women who don’t have access to contraception, to the billion-plus who are not protected by the law if they suffer violence in their home. to all the women whose pay gap with men averages 23% worldwide and up to 40% in rural areas. we owe an answer to the 783 million people who live below the poverty line, who suffer from hunger or chronic malnutrition, to those who don’t have access to basic care. we owe an answer when it comes to the aspirations of the largest number of young people in history, our young people, i.e. nearly two billion people between 10 and 24 years old today, 90% of whom live in developing countries. we owe an answer to all those who look to us because their fate depends on what we can or can’t do here together, in this assembly. and those people who forget that we owe them all an answer are wrong because they’re preparing for crises tomorrow, the day after, because they’ll leave their successors, because we’ll leave our children in a much worse situation than the one we’re in right now. 2030 agenda for sustainable development we have made progress on reducing inequalities between our countries, and we have given ourselves the framework for this with the 2030 agenda for [sustainable] development; but the battle is not behind us, it is far from over. per capita wealth is 50 times greater in oecd countries than it is in low-income countries. do we believe we can build stability, balance, over the long term, given such a situation? no, we must act! that’s why – as i announced here last year – i decided to increase france’s official development assistance by €1 billion from 2019. our humanitarian funding will go up 40%. french g7 presidency but this is also why the fight against inequalities will be the priority of france’s g7 summit presidency in 2019. indeed, after canada – whose leadership i want to pay tribute to here –, france will hold the next presidency of the g7, whose format i would like to thoroughly revise to involve more effectively several other powers, and work at new forms of coordination. it’s at the united nations first that i want to say this inequalities agenda will be central to the next g7. i am also pledging to you to report back on the results of the biarritz g7 next september, because the time when a club of rich countries could alone define the world’s inequalities is long gone, because the fate of every country belonging to it is inseparable from that of every member of this assembly. yes, we must tackle present-day inequalities today because they’re at the root of the evil i was denouncing at the beginning of my speech. we must tackle inequalities of destiny. it’s a moral aberration as much as a reality which is untenable. it is unacceptable not to enjoy the same opportunities depending on the country you are born in, not to be able to go to school in some countries because you are a woman, not to have access to certain basic care. education we’ve honored the pledge the president of senegal and i made right here last year; the global partnership for education’s financing conference in dakar in february raised $2.5 7 billion to develop access to education in the world. it’s a historic sum. france increased its contribution tenfold. the active efforts the g7 has already begun to make under canada’s presidency will have to allow further progress. we are at a watershed on this issue, during which we’ll be able to grasp the full extent of the challenge facing us, or not. six hundred and twenty million more children in the world need to be provided with schooling between now and 2030, including 444 million africans. are we going to give ourselves the resources for this? are we going to give them all the resources for a solid grounding, enabling them to take control of their lives, fraternal lives in tomorrow’s world? if we don’t, what kind of world are we setting up for ourselves? this is why i have committed france to this battle to such an extent, it’s why i place so much emphasis on teacher training, vocational education and educational equality between boys and girls. this is why i call on you all to become part of this global drive for education. education and health won’t just be the pillars of our societies in the 21st century; they will be the basic components of our economies too. gender we must also fight passionately against gender-linked inequalities. i have made gender parity in france the great cause of my five-year term, and i issue an appeal here to make this a great global cause with you. women and girls are the first to be affected by poverty, conflict, the consequences of global warming; they are the first victims of sexist and sexual violence, which too often prevents them from moving around freely, working or choosing what happens to their bodies. our responsibility in the 21st century is to end these kinds of violence, from harassment on the street to femicide. it’s time our world stopped making women victims and at last gave them their rightful place – the one where they are leaders too! we must guarantee them access everywhere to education, healthcare, jobs, and to taking economic and political decisions, and fight every kind of violence they are subjected to. so france will propose to governments wishing to move forward with us the creation of a coalition for adopting new laws for gender equality. fifty percent of our development aid will be devoted to projects to reduce gender inequalities. health we must also relaunch efforts to fight health inequalities at international level. we are hosting the replenishment conference of the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria in lyon in 2019. we will retake the initiative on the fight against fake drugs and step up our action to tackle major pandemics. i call on everyone here to mobilize. climate finally, we must fight – with a passionate sense of urgency – against environmental inequalities. it is unacceptable for 45% of greenhouse gas emissions to be produced by 10% of the planet’s richest inhabitants. it is inefficient – as is the case with solar power – for countries with the largest potential and greatest needs to be those with the least access to the appropriate technology. 8 it is indefensible that 100 million more people will be doomed to extreme poverty by 2030 if we don’t succeed in honoring our commitments to fight global warming. here too, it is a battle which must bring us together. some countries here are suffering more than others and we owe them solidarity. but we will all have to provide an explanation to our peoples and our own children for this growing number of disasters. paris climate agreement the heralded breakdown of the paris agreement has been averted, because we’ve managed to remain united, despite the american decision to withdraw from it. this strength must continue to carry us along and dispel all fatalistic approaches. we’re told that solutions exist but that funding isn’t up to the mark. then let’s go and find it; let’s innovate. that is what we did in paris on 12 december last year, with many of you, at the one planet summit, with concrete commitments and initial results. it is what we did at the beginning of the year in delhi with the international solar alliance. it is what we’ll do again in new york tomorrow, with the second one planet summit. we’re told that it is already too late, that we won’t meet the targets. then let’s speed up, let’s adopt together the paris agreement’s rules of implementation at cop24 in december. let’s implement the protocol against hfc gasses, which could enable us to reduce the planet’s average temperature by 1ºc by 2050. let’s set ourselves the goal of concluding in 2020 a plan for an ambitious global pact for the environment, and making the beijing cop on biodiversity and the iucn world conservation congress in france in 2020 decisive steps. let’s commit ourselves clearly and let’s all be equally clear, concrete and coherent. it is an emergency. so let’s comply with the commitments we’ve made. let’s sign no more trade agreements with powers that don’t respect the paris agreement. let’s ensure our trade commitments include our environmental and social obligations. let’s more heavily mobilize sovereign funds, which finance this low-carbon policy strategy. france will continue to exercise global leadership in this battle, along with everyone who so wishes. we will work at the g7 to ensure that the commitments made at cop21 are revised upwards, and if one of the members doesn’t want to move forward, we will move forward even so, going to seek new coalitions, new formats, because the g7’s remit is to remain a united group of countries committed to democracy. but today it must also help create new coalitions enabling the global collective system to be furthered and rebuilt. so let’s build new forms of cooperation so as to move forward and take decisions on these fundamental issues. inequalities only together can we effectively combat all these inequalities, which have each fractured our societies. mistrust in our societies and the temptation of self-absorption are fuelled by this. they are fuelled by all these inequalities we have allowed to emerge and by our collective inability to address them effectively. 9 but none of us, acting alone, can effectively combat these inequalities i’ve just denounced. otherwise there will ultimately be only two solutions. the first would be to always choose the lowest common denominator and follow the standards we know; this is what we have done for decades. there is a trade war, so let’s reduce workers’ rights, let’s reduce taxes even more, let’s fuel inequalities in order to try to tackle our trade difficulties. what does this lead to? to deeper inequalities in our societies and to this fracture we are currently experiencing. the other response would be to say it is the rules that don’t work. so let’s withdraw into ourselves. isolationism, protectionism. but this leads to only one thing: an increase in tensions. it in no way addresses deep inequalities. i propose, on the contrary, that we establish a collective mechanism for working together on what we’re doing, in each of our countries, to reduce inequalities. to assess our actions but also make them more consistent and spread good practice. so i propose that the international institutions – the united nations but also, of course, the oecd – support us in establishing this mechanism, for which the g7 will have to be the driving force. wto reform in order to defeat inequalities, we must change approach and scale. first of all, revise both our trading and social rules; rather than pursuing protectionism, we must all work together to radically revise the wto rules. we must restore the wto’s ability to resolve conflicts, enact rules to deal with unfair trade practices, non-respect for intellectual property and forced technology transfers, which no longer allow for a fair fight. this year, the g20 in argentina must give us a credible road map for radically reforming the wto. this is also what we’ll have to do at social level, next year, during the centenary of the international labor organization. secondly, we’ll also have to develop the practical details of our action, bring into our field of collective action the major absentees from this hall and from our general assembly, the major non-state actors who help change the world but who don’t play a sufficient role in reducing the inequalities these transformations bring about. i’m referring to the major digital players, in terms of both taxation and responsibility in the battle against the manipulation of information. on all our major challenges, our collective action must also work differently and include dialog with these new private players and these internet giants. africa thirdly, we must give africa its full role, to ensure its role is central to the recomposition of the international system. it is not just on that continent that we will collectively win or lose our great battle against inequalities. it is with that continent. 10 because it is indeed today in africa that we find the most fervent champions of multilateralism and regional integration, because our african partners have clearly understood that together we will be in a position to tackle our common challenges. and the french g7 presidency will also set to work on this new alliance with africa. as you see, i believe very strongly that in the face of these rifts, these challenges in the contemporary world order, we can build a new language of action and we must, at the same time, attack the underlying causes that contemporary inequalities represent. and it’s the responsibility of france and all its european partners, the european union, to be at the forefront of this battle, to build this new contemporary humanism which must not yield an inch to temptations of self-absorption or to naivety, and at the same time build, as mediating powers, these new rules of the international order. multilateralism ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our collective system is breaking up, i must say we have never needed it so much. we will therefore support the agencies working for a project of peace and humanity: unesco – the very conscience of the united nations –, the human rights council, the international criminal court, and unrwa, for which we will increase our contribution because, i remind you here, it is simply about enabling hundreds of thousands of children to go to school. nothing more, nothing less. we will support the enlargement of the security council in its members’ two categories so that its composition reflects contemporary balances and it is strengthened as a place of consultation and not obstruction. we will ensure that by the end of the year at this general assembly, two-thirds of its members can support the suspension of the right of veto in the event of mass atrocities. we will defend international humanitarian law by supporting staff who take every risk to help civilians on the ground, by negotiating, one by one, humanitarian access in every theater. on the 70th anniversary of the 1948 declaration, we will recall that human rights are not a cultural phenomenon, revocable values or options, but a body of law sanctified by international treaties to which the members of this assembly freely consented. we will recall that their universality is not contrary to the sovereignty of peoples but that it is the only possible condition for protecting and exercising their rights. france will be there to ensure the world does not forget that the din of nationalism always leads to the abyss, that democracies are weak if they lack courage in defending their principles, and that accumulated resentment, combined with a fragile international system, can lead twice in the space of a human life to a global unleashing of violence. i am talking here from our own experience. in a few weeks’ time, on 11 november 1918, the paris peace forum will provide an opportunity for a surge in intelligence and courage in order to regain what keeps us here together. it must provide an opportunity, united by the tragedies of the 20th century, to renew 11 and revitalize our solemn promise to protect future generations from the scourge of war. i want us and our counterparts together to shoulder new responsibilities, in order to mark out a path at the forum for specific actions to promote peace. i know, my dear friends, that many people may be tired of multilateralism. i know that in a world where information clashes, where we have entered a world of showbiz, in a sense, freed of inhibitions, and where saying the worst things means being in fashion, making the news; i know that denouncing consequences whose causes one has cherished can be a crowdpleaser; i know that championing cooperation and multilateralism may no longer be in fashion. then let’s not be in fashion any more, because we owe it to those who have enabled us to be seated here, because never forget that the genocides that led to your being here today were fuelled by the language we are growing accustomed to, because they were fuelled by the demagoguery we applaud, because we are currently seeing this international law and all forms of cooperation crumbling, as if it were business as usual – out of fear, out of complicity, because it looks good! no, i can’t agree to that, because i come from a country which promoted the declarations that brought us here, because i come from a country which stands up, which has made a lot of mistakes and done a lot of bad things but has, throughout its history and international history, had something universal about it! it’s today, it’s now! so don’t grow accustomed, let’s not accept all these forms of unilateralism! i can’t get used to these pages being torn every day, these betrayals of our history! so i say to you very clearly: the century which has begun is watching us, and our children are waiting for us! let’s resolve the crises! let’s work together to combat all these inequalities, but let’s do so in a human way and with the stringency of our principles, our history, passionately driven by our universalism! in any case, this will be my commitment to you, and i am counting on you for it./.","emmanuel macron, president of france, said that despite achievements in human rights and poverty eradication in the last decades, financial, climactic and gaping issues of inequality remain today. the international community’s collective ability to attack these crises has been hampered by the security council. cultural relativism is pervasive and could render the united nations a symbol of powerlessness. as everyone pursues their own interests, such unilateral pursuit leads directly to isolation and conflict. the task is not to fuel tensions but to put forth a new agenda through dialog and multilateralism. trade imbalances can be solved with common rules that guarantee fair competition, not bilateral dealings. as well, solving the israel-palestine crisis cannot happen through unilateral initiatives or by trampling on palestinians’ right to peace or underestimating the right of israel to safety. all must go beyond historical positions to think outside the box, he said, stressing that such an approach will effect positive change on the ground. the law of the strongest will only exacerbate tensions. proposing that a new world balance to be crafted together, he called for new forms of international and regional cooperation. the upholding of sovereignty enhances regional cooperation and more robust international safeguards will enable responses to current crises. in syria, for example, the role of the organization should be to head peace efforts, provide the ways and means to solve the humanitarian crisis, and to assist in crafting a constitution and free elections. however, decisions ultimately must be made by stakeholders. in libya, this new approach would allow for a lasting solution. state institutions in that country must be supported by the united nations and the african union. all states must be able to count on themselves to guarantee their own security and must also draw upon regional and international organizations. this was the intention of the african union, an organization which should be supported by the united nations, he said, noting that a resolution along these lines would be presented by the end of the year. while sovereignty and enhanced regional and international cooperation must be upheld, only collective action allows for the upholding of sovereignty, he continued. thus, climactic, migration flows and other global issues must be tackled collectively. the only way to effectively manage migration is to address the root causes, dismantle trafficking networks and protect borders while upholding international law and right to asylum. after the financial crisis ten years ago, the international community failed to address the unequal spread of wealth across the globe and all of those who felt left behind. today the world is paying the collective price for that. a solution is needed for those suffering from gaping equality gaps, for impoverished people, for youth living in developing countries and that solution depends on what the general assembly does. france will increase its official development assistance (oda) to €1 billion, an increase of 40 per cent. as the incoming chair of the group of seven, he stated that inequalities will be addressed in that forum. in the past, rich countries could impose an agenda on the rest of the world, but those days are over, he stated. the paris agreement remains intact, despite withdrawal of the united states, and that should be reason for encouragement, he said, adding “people say it’s too late; well then, let’s hurry up”. calling for goals to be ambitious and bold, he urged member states to stop signing trade agreements for those who do not participate in the paris agreement. he also proposed that the united nations support france in the creation of a mechanism to address inequalities when the group of seven meets. as well, the world trade organization (wto) rules should be revised to put everyone on equal footing. africa must be given a central and leading role in any internationally formed new order, as it is on this continent that the battle against inequality will be won or lost. in alliance with africa, the french chairmanship of the group of seven will look at these issues, he said. “at a time where our collective system is falling apart, sadly, it is most in demand,” he said, adding that france will be there to remind everyone that nationalism always leads to defeat. if courage is lacking in the defense of fundamental principles, global war is a threat. member states must find that courage again and renew the commitment to prevent the future scourge of war. ways and means to secure global peace must be identified. acknowledging that some might be tired of multilateralism, he implored people to resist the urge to view it as “trendy”. it was genocide that led to the united nations, he said, recalling the atrocities of the second world war and the complacency of the international community at that time. but france is a country that has always fought for universality, he said, imploring people to not succumb to indifference and to not accept history unraveling. “our children are watching,” he said. “let us do this on a human level.”"
Gabon,,"michel xavier biang (gabon), expressing support for the secretary‑general’s reform agenda, said multilateralism is the ideal approach for building a more peaceful, just and inclusive world order. at a time when its underlying values are being put to the test, the united nations must be modernized and provided with the tools to address today’s most pressing issues. implementation of the sustainable development goals must be stepped up, with combatting poverty at the heart of the organization’s actions. emphasizing that poverty fuels extremism and, in turn, terrorism, he called for improved financing, innovative partnerships and technology transfers for developing countries. he underscored gabon’s commitment to implementing the goals, including through a reform process that aims to speed up the diversification of its economy away from dependence on natural resources. he called for greater international efforts to fight terrorism, expressing concern that in many parts of africa, groups like boko haram and al‑shabaab are sowing terror and destruction. capacity building at the national, regional and subregional levels must be stepped up to ensure that states can ensure their own security. with financing from the international community, africa can better respond to its security challenges, he said. greater support must be given to the group of five for the sahel (g5 sahel) force as well as prevention strategies and mechanisms that address root causes, he said. he noted gabon’s ongoing participation in the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic (minusca), as well as efforts by the secretary‑general and his special envoy to relaunch the political process in western sahara. on climate change, he said the united nations must step up its leadership role and ensure that efforts are strengthened. transforming modes of consumption and production, and implementing the paris agreement, are a moral and universal responsibility, he stated."
Gambia (Republic of The),"statement h.e. mr. adama barrow president of the republic of the gambia at the general debate of the 73""^° session of the united nations general assembly tuesday 25™ september 2018 new york mr. secretary-general, madam president, your majesties, distinguished heads of state and government, ladies and gentlemen, ail praise is due to the almighty allah for granting us the favor of gathering in this august assembly, once again, to discuss and advance our common global agenda. please allow me to begin by sincerely thanking h.e. mr. miroslav lajcak for the excellent manner he presided over the 72 session as president. by the same token, i congratulate you. madam maria garces on your assumption of the presidency of the 73 session. i assure you that, as one of your vice presidents, the gambia pledges its full support and cooperation during your tenure of office. madam presidentj the theme for the 73'^^ session, ""making the un relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies,"" is indeed very relevant in today's global affairs. by implication, the pursuit of the un's mission for peace, development and human rights also remains as relevant today as it was in 1945 when it was adopted in response to the horrific experiences and destruction during that gloomy era. amid the complex multilateral challenges that continue to confront us globally, no country can thrive or solve all its challenges in isolation. our salvation, as human beings, lies in strengthening our multilateral institutions and fostering greater international cooperation to collectively address global challenges. the un uniquely provides the opportunity to achieve this goal. madam president, it is apparent that in order to make real progress, effective global leadership is imperative. thus, as leaders, we must all shoulder our responsibilities by all means. this should compel us to support and invest more in the united nations, instead of withdrawing our participation or cutting back our financial support. it is an irony that at a time when multiple global challenges are emerging and mounting, support for the work of the united nations is being undermined through inadequate funding. those of us who value the un,as well as those who have benefitted immensely from its work, should be at the forefront to call upon all member states to step up support for the organization. indeed, the un has to play a lead role in solving global challenges, and our task is to ensure that it has the required capacity, influence and effectiveness. madam president, decisions and actions rooted in a rules-based international system that is underpinned by multilateral agreements and processes form the basis for the successful conduct of relations between and among nations. let us, therefore, restore faith in our rules-based international order so as to remain relevant and, collectively, make progress on our global agenda - ranging from tackling the menace of climate change and terrorism to addressing disarmament, trade, development and other concerns to humanity. madam president, i am confident that it is only through effective global leadership and effective international cooperation that the well-being of all of the world's citizens can be achieved. as leaders, we have the shared responsibility to promote a world order that prioritizes peace over insecurity; a world order that eliminates the growing inequalities around the world; and a world order that brings us sustainable development. madam president, with reference to the gambia, and following a difficult political impasse in december 2016, gambians have managed, with the support of our partners, to restore democracy and the rule of law in our country. we have completed our national electoral process in full, after successfully conducting both legislative and local government elections. 2i we are also resolutely pursuing institutional and constitutional reforms. such reforms have commenced, with the hope of putting the gambia on a solid path to becoming a shining champion of democracy and human rights in the world. madam president, w^hen gambians voted for change in 2016, they actually yearned to be in charge of their destiny. they wanted significant, not cosmetic, improvements in their lives. it is for this reason that my government is now implementing a comprehensive national development plan (2018-2021). the plan seeks to transform the gambia through key priorities, such as infrastructural development, agricultural transformation, macroeconomic stability, job creation and employment. the plan also seeks to consolidate our democratic gains through good governance, rule of law and respect for human and people s rights. in all, our goal is to deliver a fully transformed gambia that has a future; a country that is energy secure, food-self-sufficient and an investment friendly destination. we have also begun to exploit and harness the benefits of information communication technology as a catalyst for modernization and youth empowerment. madam president, our national development plan was presented to a successful donors conference in brussels, where significant pledges were made to meet our funding targets. i must express yet again, profound thanks to our bilateral and multilateral partners, including the united nations, european union, world bank and many others for their interest and support. we are indeed truly grateful, as we look forward to their continued collaboration and support to attain our development objectives. the ndp w ill continue to be implemented through the partnerships and solidarity built at the brussels meeting. quite thoughtfully, the plan is consistent with the agenda 2030 on sustainable development, as well as the african union agenda 2063. 3i n madam president, in our pursuit of a fully transformed gambia, we recognize the importance of a meaningful engagement with the gambian diaspora - fondly referred to as ""the eighth region of the gambia . our diaspora strategy seeks to explore and utilize the skills, talent and resources of gambians everywhere for the successful implementation of the national development plan. the gambia's experience demonstrates that democracy yields amazing dividends. remarkably, we have noticed a decrease in the number of youths attempting to undertake dangerous journeys across the mediterranean to europe. the average gambian is willing to stay in the country and contribute to national development. despite these positive developments, 1 strongly urge that interventions to curb youth migration be supported through incentives. on account of this, we look forward to the high-level conference in marrakesh, morocco in december, 2018 to adopt the new global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration. better educational and job opportunities must be harnessed for the youth in order to inspire them and give them hope in life. in this regard, my government stands ready to work collaboratively with the united nations, the african union, ecowas and other regional blocs to devise and implement suitable strategies and interventions. madam president, as a member of the sahel region, the gambia fully supports the impleimentation of the new united nations support plan for the sahel anchored in the united nations integrated strategy for the sahel - uniss. we are optimistic that it will contribute significantly to addressing the challenges of development in the sahel, as well as fostering peace, security and cross-border relations. we are particularly excited that the new strategy views the sahel as a land of opportunities, and not one of hopelessness. in light of this, we envisage that this strategy will yield important dividends for africa, especially towards the maintenance of peace and security and the elimination of terrorism in the region. strategically, we must disrupt all criminal networks and the financing of transhuman crimes through better information sharing and cross-border security initiatives. madam president, as we battle these negative forces and try to fulfill our aspiration of silencing the gun on the african continent by 2020, we are worried about the state of united nations peacekeeping missions in some of our trouble spots, especially in view of the drastic cuts to the peacekeeping budget. the unavailability of the critical resources required to support peacekeepers is quite worrisome. the gambia supports the introduction of appropriate reforms to strengthen the un's capacity for both peacebuilding and peacekeeping, and these should be reconsidered and maintained as important priorities on the organization's agenda. my government proposes that we do better to protect the lives of not only innocent civilians but also the men and women who constitute the peacekeepers. at this juncture, let me seize the opportunity to pay tribute to all the gallant peacekeepers who have fallen. w^e call on our partners to rise up to the challenge, and stop the protraction of all conflicts. consequently, we support the secretary-general's agenda for reform. madam president, as africans, we must assume leadership for maintaining peace and security on our continent. in this respect, i commend the leaders of ethiopia and eritrea for the extraordinary efforts made to bring lasting peace to the horn of africa. they have set an example for the rest of the continent to emulate. in a similar vein, i applaud the leaders of south sudan for agreeing to restore peace, and work towards developing their country. 5 i i' 5 g e we call on the leaders of libya and central african republic to intensify their efforts through political dialog for national reconciliation and peace. madam president, my government reaffirms its strong support for the two-state solution to establish peace between the palestinians and their neighbors. related to this, we pronounce our unconditional recognition of the one-china policy. similarly, we recognize the support provided by the government and people of bangladesh to address the plight of the rohingya muslims. as the upcoming chair of the next oic summit, the gambia has undertaken, through a resolution, to champion an accountability mechanism that would ensure that perpetrators of the terrible crimes against the rohingya muslims are brought to book. madam president, while it is our strong desire to see a reform that allows the secretary-general to operate efficiently, it is equally expected that the reform also facilitates the successful implementation of the agenda 2030 for sustainable development goals. madam president, reform of the united nations security council is long overdue. i wish to call that the process truly reflects all interests and positions represented in the inter governmental negotiations. we are convinced that africa's voice needs to be fully represented on the un security council. madam president, my delegation looks forward to a successful 73*^ session, and we hope that your election will solidify the platform to highlight the plight of rural women and girls during the session. 6 i p '1 madam president, before i conclude, let me express sincere condolences to the family of former un secretary general, kofi annan. mr. annan was a formidable voice on everything, including reform of the united nations. he stood for a 'just' world, and was a passionate advocate of good governance and fundamental freedoms. kofi annan will surely be greatly missed. i thank you all. 7i p","adama barrow, president of the gambia, said no country can thrive in isolation amid complex global multilateral challenges, with our salvation as human beings resting in strengthening multilateral institutions and greater international cooperation. “the un uniquely provides the opportunity to achieve this goal,” he added. noting the irony of underfunding the united nations in that context, he called upon member states to step up support. turning to his own country, he noted that after a difficult political impasse in 2016, the gambia had restored democracy and the rule of law, completing its national electoral process and further pursuing institutional and electoral reforms. with gambians yearning to oversee their destiny, the government is implementing a national development plan (2018–2021) to transform the country through infrastructural development, agricultural transformation, macroeconomic stability, job creation and employment. aiming to deliver “a fully transformed gambia that has a future”, they have begun to harness information and communications technology (ict) to catalyze modernization and youth empowerment. the plan is consistent with the 2030 agenda and agenda 2063 of the african union. saying he recognized the “importance of a meaningful engagement with the gambian diaspora — fondly referred to as ‘the eighth region of the gambia’”, the strategy seeks to utilize the talents and resources of gambians everywhere. in that regard, there has been a decrease in young people making dangerous journeys across the mediterranean to europe. strongly urging incentivized intervention to curb youth migration, he looked forward to the high-level conference in morocco to adopt a new global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. as a member of the sahel, the gambia fully supports implementation of the new united nations support plan for the region, anchored in the united nations integrated strategy for the sahel. as the new strategy views the sahel as a land of opportunity, not hopelessness, he sees it yielding important dividends for africa, especially in peace, security and the elimination of terrorism. aiming to “fulfill our aspiration of silencing the gun on the african continent by 2020”, he worried that united nations peacekeeping missions will suffer from drastic budget cuts and lack of critical resources and called for appropriate reforms. “as africans, we must assume leadership for maintaining peace and security on our continent,” he said, commending ethiopia and eritrea for “extraordinary efforts” to bring peace to the horn of africa, and south sudan for agreeing to restore peace and work for development. he called on libya and the central african republic to intensify their efforts. internationally, he affirmed support for the two-state solution for peace between the palestinians and their neighbors, offered unconditional recognition of the one-china policy and recognized the support of bangladesh in addressing the plight of rohingya muslims. as chair of the next organization of islamic cooperation (oic) summit, he said the gambia will champion an accountability mechanism to “ensure that perpetrators of terrible crimes against the rohingya muslims are brought to book”."
Georgia,"9/28/2018 government of georgia speech by georgian prime minister mamuka bakhtadze at the 73rd session of the un general assembly government of georgia government.gov.ge speech by georgian prime minister mamuka bakhtadze at the 73rd session of the un general assembly 2018-09-27 madame president, mr. secretary-general, esteemed delegates, ladies and gentlemen, http://gov.ge/print.php?gg=1&sec_id=497&info_id=68059&lang_id=eng 1/5 9/28/2018 government of georgia speech by georgian prime minister mamuka bakhtadze at the 73rd session of the un general assembly it is a great honor to address the general assembly in my native tongue, georgian, one of the most ancient languages of the world civilization and its integral part. today is the 27th of september, an extremely troubling and painful date in my country's history. 25 years ago today, the occupation of georgia's historical part started, turning into the most severe challenge for georgia's newly established statehood. 10 years ago, the russian federation launched yet another large-scale military aggression against my country, which resulted in the full occupation of georgia's two historic and integral regions of abkhazia and tskhinvali. 10 years after this military aggression, our territories remain occupied. as a result of the ethnic cleansing, 10% of our population is still forcefully displaced, the rights of hundreds of thousands of our citizens are disregarded. the situation in abkhazia and the tskhinvali region is dire and alarming. the situation in the occupied territories is a humanitarian disaster at its worst. the growing militarization of these regions is in full swing, and depopulation is intensifying by the minute. because of the grave humanitarian, socioeconomic, and human rights situation, the population in the occupied regions has dropped 5-6 times since the occupation. all this reiterates that the russian federation's main motivation was a military intervention to establish military bases in our territories, not to protect the rights or interests of the local population, as they publicly, officially declare. this true intention is witnessed firsthand on a daily basis by our citizens in the occupied territories. razor wires and other artificial barriers split families and violate fundamental human rights. those who live along the occupation lines are even prevented from visiting houses of prayer and the graves of their ancestors. our citizens are prohibited from educating their children in the native language. аbductions, torture, and murder continue. archil tatunashvili, giga otkhozoria, and 18 year-old davit basharuli are the recent victims. because of these and many other cruel offenses, the otkhozoria-tatunashvili list was created to include the names of those who committed these egregious crimes. we believe that those on the list must be held accountable through applicable international law. the occupation and blatant disregard of the rule of law has created serious challenges to the stability and security of georgia and the wider region. due to the existing conflicts in the south caucasus, even a minor incident may escalate into an uncontainable process with subsequent heavy consequences. the international community's firm support in the peaceful resolution of the russia-georgia conflict is critically important. the international community must stand together and stand strong in support of the principle of sovereign equality of states and the inviolability of their internationally recognized borders, because observing the fundamental norms of international law and protecting human rights is the only way of ensuring peace and security throughout the world. russia has yet to fulfill its international obligations and the 2008 ceasefire agreement reached through the mediation of the eu. we, on the other hand, have fulfilled this agreement to the detail. moreover, we have assumed the legally binding obligation of non-use of force. this reaffirms our irreversible policy of the exclusively peaceful resolution of the conflict. therefore, i urge the russian federation: fulfill your assumed and signed international obligations and withdraw your occupation forces from georgia's territory! we are actively trying to use the format of the geneva international discussions, yet our attempts at the negotiation table encounter unfounded and absolutely unacceptable resistance from russia. i would like to reiterate that we attach special importance to the role of the un in the geneva talks, which the un co-chairs together with the osce and the eu. in the 21st century, as people, nations, and cultures strive for greater integration and development, installing artificial barriers and barbed wires is absolutely unacceptable. we want to break the deadlock in russia-georgia relations, but that can only be accomplished based on the respect for georgia's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and the principles of international law. despite this injustice, our only response to these challenges is peace and georgia's development. we have proposed a new peace initiative designed to overcome the humanitarian disaster in the occupied territories and create new opportunities for our citizens in the occupied territories. with this initiative, we are fighting to stop the process of depopulation in the occupied territories and to ensure respect for fundamental human rights. http://gov.ge/print.php?gg=1&sec_id=497&info_id=68059&lang_id=eng 2/5 9/28/2018 government of georgia speech by georgian prime minister mamuka bakhtadze at the 73rd session of the un general assembly we call this imitative a step to a better future, which seeks precisely to provide the populations in the occupied territories with access to healthcare and education services, to create for them opportunities for commercial activities as a means for feeding their families and ensuring their physical survival. today, from this rostrum, i would like to address our abkhaz and ossetian compatriots: georgia's every success is your success! we share a common historical past, which must pave the way for our future, which i am convinced will bring us peace and prosperity. it is the georgian authorities' duty to protect and guarantee the rights of every citizen, and we are committed to fulfilling this duty irreversibly. you should enjoy all the benefits put in place by georgia, be it human rights, education, healthcare, or visa-free travel to europe. i would like to address especially the youth: together, through joint efforts and pursuing opportunities, we will achieve success and prosperity. i want you to know that it is only in unity with you that we see our future. and once again, i would like to urge russia against undermining and compromising our peace initiatives, to enable the citizens in the occupied territories to lead a decent life. ladies and gentlemen, with its rich culture and ancient history, georgia has always been standing by the world's civilized nations, contributing to the development of european and global civilizations. accordingly, we remain engaged in the fight against the challenges facing humankind. today the list is unfortunately quite long; it includes conflicts, terrorism, migration and forced displacement problems, climate change, poverty, and grave human rights violations. addressing these issues requires enormous effort and a strong political will from the united nations and its' every member state. all of us, each and every one of us, must confront these chalenges to make the world a better place. we strongly believe that pursuing national interests in the modern world should be based on mutual respect and in nowise at the expense of one another. it is precisely in this context that i would like to echo the theme of this general assembly and reaffirm that we are committed to making our contribution to our shared goal of peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, and to the strengthening the role of the united nations for progress in achieving its goals. dear colleagues, by establishing a democratic republic a century ago, georgia made its civilizational choice to define the future of our nation-we belong in the common european family. this choice remains unchanged as yet another strong argument in support of our european identity. georgia, with its values and contribution, has always been an organic part of europe, which continues its path through successful cooperation with the eu. when georgia declared independence a century ago, its constitution built on the very values and principles that remain relevant and progressive even today. suffice to say, the multiparty georgian parliament a century ago included five women of different confessions, an achievement rarely found even among the established democracies of that time. the 100th anniversary of this event, the declaration of the democratic republic, is celebrated by my country this year. georgia restored its independence 27 years ago and embarked on a path to build a modern democratic state. it may not seem like a long time in historical terms, but our young democracy has faced multifarious trials and tribulations over this period. today's georgia is the heir and successor to the values planted a century ago. georgia's progress in the recent years in terms of democratic consolidation, respect of human rights, and strengthening the rule of law is unequivocally a result of the country's fundamental reforms. http://gov.ge/print.php?gg=1&sec_id=497&info_id=68059&lang_id=eng 3/5 9/28/2018 government of georgia speech by georgian prime minister mamuka bakhtadze at the 73rd session of the un general assembly our strong parliament, non-partisan president, independent judiciary, and effective government stem from our successful constitutional reform-consequently, the country is switching to the european parliamentary model of governance. for us, the country's development fully focuses on a free human being and human capital created by free human beings. the ambitious educational reform, the modernization of the system of education will prove to be yet another breakthrough on the path to overcoming the challenges that face my country today. only educated, motivated, confident youth can bring about progress, eliminate poverty, and place georgia among developed and innovative economies. a small, flexible, and effective government is counterbalanced by strong public and institutional mechanisms of control and civil society, which perfectly reflects our commitments under sustainable development goal (sdg) 16. georgia's election last year as chair of the open government partnership is the country's recognition bearing witness to the effectiveness of our relevant efforts and bringing our society concrete results. protection of fundamental human rights and dignity is our top priority. in this regard, georgia has emerged as the region's leading reformer in the recent years. especially noteworthy is the fact that we have overcome a major challenge we inherited in the penitentiary system. most notably, we have visible progress with regard to the respect of human rights in prisons. we have implemented important judicial reforms, which we intend to continue by launching the next wave of reforms. one of the main achievements of our political force is media freedom and media pluralism. in 2018, georgia further improved its position in the world press freedom index, and we have exceptional achievements in terms of internet freedom. civil society plays a definitive role in the process of democracy building. without a strong civil society, especially in a young democracy, the country's harmonious development is unimaginable. we want an independent, strong, and active civil society to develop in our country. under our sustainable development policy, we have prioritized green policy and green economy. at the same time, we are developing digital economy poised to advance the country to a qualitatively new level. our economic strategy relies on inclusive economic development and economic growth that reflects in the well-being of each citizen. we are successful in implementing this strategy seeking to transform georgia into the region's economic, tourism, logistics, and educational hub, as evidenced by our leading positions in reputable international rankings. our country's unique geography and strategic location between europe and asia has positioned georgia for centuries as an attractive meeting place for civilizations and cultural dialog. we continue fulfilling this function, and we are implementing ambitious new projects to this end. a few years ago, we addressed the world from this platform and offered to host the silk road forum in georgia. we have not only made this forum a reality but have also reclaimed georgia's historical role in the wider silk road region. today, however, i would like to propose a new initiative and offer you to facilitate the tbilisi forum focusing on transforming the black sea region and the caucasus, currently areas of confrontation and challenges, into a space for peace, cooperation, and development. georgia's every achievement, its democratic and economic development, and leading regional positions across a number of directions is the very result of our european and euro-atlantic choice, which is enshrined in the constitution and the relevant parliamentary resolution. nato-georgia relations have become very dynamic and comprehensive. georgia is a nato aspirant country and an enhanced opportunities partner, the largest per capita contributor of troops in the afghanistan mission, thereby contributing to the architecture of global security. you are all aware of the disturbing threat of transnational terrorism, which is much larger and overwhelming today than ever. terrorism is the 21st century's common enemy. in the fight against this common threat, georgia has always stood, and will continue to stand, shoulder to shoulder with the international community. unfortunately, many valiant georgian soldiers have fallen in this global fight. we all agree that the fight against terrorism along with its prevention and adequate response is only possible through joint efforts and shared responsibilities. i am convinced that we will defeat this common challenge. http://gov.ge/print.php?gg=1&sec_id=497&info_id=68059&lang_id=eng 4/5 9/28/2018 government of georgia speech by georgian prime minister mamuka bakhtadze at the 73rd session of the un general assembly ladies and gentlemen, georgia's pain is not a problem facing only one country. in 2008, aggression against georgia was perceived in the world as a problem in the relations between only two countries. the way things unfolded further, however, showed that the then world was unprepared to provide an adequate assessment and response to this aggression. unfortunately, the united nations proved to be ineffective in the face of this challenge. moreover, the system of global security is eroding before our very eyes. today's world needs a stronger united nations! today, the international community needs institutions capable of properly evaluating and responding to the current challenges, or preventing the risks undermining global security. as you know, debates on reform the un originated in the 1990s, though we must admit that we cannot attest to any serious success in this direction so far. this is why the issue of reforming the united nations remains relevant, and i believe it requires immediate action. as the world faces the challenges of the a new era with problems yet to be identified, we all have a task of caring and jointly overcoming global challenges in order to ensure a peaceful and better world for future generations! thank you for your time. http://gov.ge/print.php?gg=1&sec_id=497&info_id=68059&lang_id=eng 5/5","mamuka bakhtadze, prime minister of georgia, said he was honored to address the assembly in his native language on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the painful occupation of georgia’s historical regions. ten years ago, the russian federation launched another large-scale military aggression which resulted in the full occupation of abkhazia and tskhinvali. the situation in those regions is dire and alarming, and constitutes a humanitarian disaster as militarization and depopulation efforts intensify. he said moscow’s motivation is a military intervention with the aim to establish military bases on georgian territory. following the many human rights violations perpetrated in those regions, the otkhozoria‑tatunashvili list was created to monitor rights violators and bring them to justice, he continued. blatant disregard for the rule of law in occupied territories has created serious challenges for georgia and the region as a whole, he said, calling on the international community to firmly support the principle of sovereign equality. he added that the russian federation is not fulfilling its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement. georgia is proposing a new peace initiative designed to provide people in occupied territories with access to health care and education services and to create commercial opportunities, he said. the government is committed to protecting and guaranteeing the rights of every georgian. he urged the russian federation not to undermine the initiative. the pursuit of national interests must be based on mutual respect, he stressed, adding that georgia is an organic part of europe and continues on its path to cooperate with the european union. he went on to say that georgia’s recent progress in democratic consolidation, respect for human rights and strengthening the rule of law is the result of fundamental reform processes. development strategies in the country focus on strengthening human capital, including an ambitious education reform. the protection of fundamental human rights and dignity is a national priority and georgia has emerged as the region’s leading reformer. protections of fundamental rights are enhanced by freedom of the media and the active participation of civil society actors in defining the process of democracy building. turning to development matters, he said georgia’s sustainable development policy focuses on the establishment of green and digital economies. that reform process is transforming georgia into an economic, tourism, logistics and education hub. a new initiative to transform the black sea region into a space for peace and development has also been proposed, he said. in addition, relations with nato are dynamic and comprehensive as the country aspires to join that organization. he affirmed that georgia stands with the international community in the fight against transnational terrorism. however, the global security system is eroding, he said, adding that united nations reform remains relevant."
Germany,"1 !.¦ : : speech by the federal minister for foreign affairs, heiko maas, member of the german bundestag at the general debate of the 73rd general assembly of the united nations new york, 28 september 2018 madam president / mr president, ladies and gentlemen, a veteran of un diplomacy told me the other day that every general assembly has its own crisis to discuss, its own major topic. so what is tt]e big issue in 2018? syria? north korea? the middle east? or the dramatic global refugee situation from the mediterranean to venezuela? if you take a step back, these disparate conflicts reveal a bigger picture and a distinct pattern. it becomes clear that we are indeed faced with a crisis - the crisis of multilateralism. and this crisis makes conflicts around the world appear irresolvable. when i say they appear irresolvable, this reflects the faith we germans have in 3 multilateralism. germany s postwar success story is also multilateralism s success story. europe, which was scarred by war and destruction, was able to integrate in freedom, security and prosperity thanks to our european neighbors courage in seeking reconciliation. the united states also played a crucial role in europe s reconstruction. the fact that it was this europe that was able to become the united nations’ closest partner is a triumph of multilateralism. we believe in the united nations because international cooperation changed our own fate for the better. europe has proved to the world that multilateralism and sovereignty are not a contradiction in terms. on the contrary, in a world faced with immense global problems, we can only safeguard sovereignty if we work together! the three words, we the peoples , express both our goal and how we will achieve it. that s why the founders of the united nations put these words at the start of the charter. they wanted to spell out that we need to work together to find solutions. they wanted to leave no doubt as to whom the united nations and we as delegates serve - the people. the charter s promise is addressed to the people, who are told that their freedom and dignity will be defended at the united nations in new york. but does a boy in idlib who lives in constant fear of the next air strike feel this? how does a girl in africa feel when her life expectancy at birth is 30 years lower than in germany? if we do not act on their behalf, we the peoples will simply be hollow words for them. 5 kofi annan once said: we don t need any more promises. we need to start keeping the promises we already made. when germany joins the security council as a non-permanent member in a few weeks time, that will be what motivates us. thank you for the huge trust you showed in us through your votes. your trust is an incentive for us to play our part in tackling the world’s crises - and to do so with courage and confidence, but without over-estimating ourselves. we want to work with you as a reliable partner that puts dialog and cooperation at the heart of what it does. in our view, we the peoples particularly refers to those who find it hard to be heard at the united nations. and that means we will always seek dialog with civil society - in the security council and beyond. however, we the peoples also means that the security council itself must become more representative and inclusive. the world s population has more than tripled since 1945, while the number of un member states has almost quadrupled. however, the security council has hardly changed at all. that s why we should stop beating around the bush and finally start real negotiations on security council reform, as the vast majority of the member states has wanted for a long time. ladies and gentlemen, nowhere is the crisis of multilateralism more painfully evident than in syria. the civil war has long since turned into a widespread regional conflict, with further potential for escalation in an already ravaged region. 7 this sort of war cannot be resolved by military means, as the regional players are too deeply involved and the individual sta es are too high. with united diplomatic efforts, we did, however, manage to prevent escalation in idlib. that is a glimmer of hope! the agreement between turkey and russia must now be permanently implemented. but ultimately, and at long last, we need a political process. to this end, the talks must be held under the auspices of the united nations. in resolution 2254, the security council itself showed the way. we must finally take this path to free and fair elections. at that point, we will also be willing to shoulder responsibility for reconstruction. however, there is one line we will not cross - we will 8 not become accomplices to a regime that has forfeited its political legitimacy. instead, we are doing our utmost to alleviate people s suffering. it is shameful that financial support is running out once again. as the second-largest humanitarian donor, germany is willing to provide unhcr with a further 116 million euros - that is, half of the amount currently needed - to help syrian refugees in jordan and lebanon. but others also need to step up. after all, the charter talks about we the peoples . disruptive foreign-policy approaches have now also reached the israeli-palestinian conflict. many people are keen to make us believe that the negotiated two-state solution is obsolete. they want us to think it is now merely a term used in diplomacy and can no longer be achieved. but whatever way you twist it, there will only be lasting peace if people can lead selfdetermined lives in security and dignity on both sides of the 1967 lines. that s precisely why, even 25 years after oslo, working on a negotiated two-state solution is still the right thing to do. the conflict in ukraine will also continue to occupy us. along with france, russia and ukraine, we are working hard to implement the minsk agreements. the focus is on the measures agreed a long time ago with a view to stabilizing the ceasefire. all efforts, including our discussion on a possible un mission in eastern ukraine, are aimed at achieving that. ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that acute crisis management is at best a step towards peace. lasting peace 10 can only be achieved if we put a stop to the arms race. t is is not some sort of nostalgic rhetoric from the days of the cold war, whose balance of terror seems utterly benign compared with the scenario of a multipolar arms race, with far more unpredictable players. in the case of north korea, the security council s united stance and the sanctions helped to pave the way back to dialog. that was important. however, north korea must follow up its words with deeds, and this must lead to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. germany is prepared to contribute its know-how, including the expertise we gained during the difficult negotiations with iran. the nuclear agreement with iran may not be perfect. but so far, it has prevented iran from 11 obtaining nuclear weapons and averted an escalation that, three years ago, was highly likely. that s not insignificant! we europeans therefore stand together by the agreement. we are working on keeping economic exchange with iran possible, and we call on iran to continue to fully implement its commitments. the fact that we stand by the jcpoa does not mean that we are turning a blind eye to iran s destructive role in the region or to its ballistic missile program. that said, if there were no agreement, this would not make the search for solutions in yemen, syria or elsewhere any easier. on the contrary, disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation must generally become more of a focus of the united nations’ work once again. we share secretary-general guterres’ view on this. 12 our common rules must keep pace with technological developments. otherwise, what currently sounds like science fiction may very soon become deadly reality - autonomous weapons systems, or killer robots, that kill without any human control. i ask that you please support, both here in new york and in geneva, our initiative to ban fully autonomous weapons - before it is too late! ladies and gentlemen, not only in this domain is prevention the right answer. the united nations of the 21st century must tackle the root causes of conflict. these include climate change. action based solely on nationalism, with the objective of putting my country first , reaches its limits here - not least because our climate knows no borders. 13 the alarm bells have rarely sounded as loudly as they did in the summer of 2018 - in almost all parts of the world. germany and the european union stand by the paris climate agreement. moreover, we want to ensure that the security council makes the devastating effects that climate change can have on the security and stability of entire countries and regions an even greater priority. we also need a quantum leap as regards post-conflict peacebuilding. that is why germany will contribute at least 25 million euros to the peacebuilding fund this year. over the last three years, germany has tripled its contributions toward promoting stabilization and preventing crises around the world. 14 take, for example, iraq, where the terrorists of islamic state have for the most part been militarily defeated. instead of leaving the iraqi authorities to fend for themselves, we are training security forces, fostering administrative structures and providing civil support to promote stabilization, reconciliation and inclusive reconstruction in the country. only when military measures are embedded in a clear political strategy will peacekeepers truly bring peace. this is also the objective of secretary-general guterres peacekeeping reform efforts. it would be a mistake to limit our discussion to bartering over decimal points in scales for assessed contributions. of course, efficiency is important - also for us europeans, as the largest funding contributor. however, discussing potential cost savings alone does not do justice to the benefits that 15 peacekeeping missions bring, for example in countries such as mali or lebanon, which have held peaceful elections and enjoyed relative stability, in part thanks to the blue helmets and the political efforts of the united nations. we germans will continue to contribute - militarily, financially, and always also politically, through diplomatic efforts and by investing in stability and reconstruction. after all, the success of un missions hinges on member states political backing. this is particularly true for libya right now. to tackle the herculean task of advancing functioning state structures, the united nations needs our political support. ladies and gentlemen, peace is more than guns falling silent. 16 only just societies will remain peaceful in the long term - societies in which men and women enjoy equal rights and in which women participate in an social decision¬ making. this is not only a matter of fairness and respect. it is simply about humanity and reason. kofi annan taught us that we will not enjoy development without security, or security without development. we will not enjoy either without universal respect for human rights. seventy years after the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights, its proclamation of dignity and personal freedom remains merely a distant promise for many. in the security council, in the human rights council or here at the general assembly, we will demand accountability when human rights are trampled underfoot, whether this 17 concerns human trafficking in africa or attacks on the rohingya in myanmar. even in war, there are limits. we must hold to account those who wilfully attack humanitarian aid workers, hospitals or schools. anyone who violates the most basic rules of human civilisation must be punished. that also applies to those who use chemical weapons, thereby breaking a taboo that was respected for decades. this is why it is so important that the opcw has meanwhile been authorized to find and identify those responsible. the perpetrators must be fully aware that there can be no impunity for crimes against humanity. never, not anywhere! in this regard, the international criminal court remains indispensable because it sends a clear message to the victims and the 18 perpetrators of the most serious crimes that justice will prevail. ladies and gentlemen, earlier, i spoke about how we germans in particular have faith when it comes to multilateralism. this faith is also based on the fact that the united nations, time and again and despite all disagreements, delivers proof of what we can achieve through joint efforts. i am thinking of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which remains our guiding principle for making this a better world for all people. i am also thinking about the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the global compacts for migration and on refugees. the fact that more than 190 member states countries of origin, transit and destination - 19 reached agreement on such complex and controversial issues is a victory for multilateralism! it is a success achieved by truly united nations. the united nations is built on our courage to reach compromises. the organization grows with our desire to shape things. it thrives on our common pledge of together first . common ground is created when we put people at the heart of what we do. the desire for peace and security, and the dream of a prosperous and dignified life, are things that all people share - whether they live in baghdad, berlin or bamako. the united ations belongs to the people. it is to them that we owe allegiance. we the peoples !","heiko maas, minister for foreign affairs of germany, said that the current crisis of multilateralism makes the many conflicts around the world appear unresolvable. however, germany’s post‑war success story is evidence of the success of multilateralism. its neighbors and the united states played a crucial role in germany’s recovery. “we believe in the united nations because international cooperation changed our own fate for the better,” he said. multilateralism and sovereignty are not a contradiction in terms, he said. in fact, sovereignty can only be safeguarded when countries work together. if the united nations community does not act to fulfill its charter, to protect the freedom and dignity of all, especially marginalized people, the founding principles will be meaningless, he said. as an incoming non-permanent member of the security council, germany will be motivated by these principles, he said, also calling for more inclusion and diverse representation on the council. the conflict in syria is an example of the need for multilateralism, he pointed out, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling the turkey–russian federation agreement to create a demilitarized zone in syria’s idlib region. free and fair elections must be held in syria, after which his country is willing to help with reconstruction. “however, there is one line we will not cross – we will not become accomplices to a regime that has forfeited its political legitimacy,” he said. as the second‑largest donor to the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), germany will give another 116 million euros – half the requisite amount — to help syrian refugees in jordan and lebanon, he said, calling on other member states to increase their donations. turning to the conflict in ukraine, he said germany is working with that country, france and the russian federation to implement the minsk agreements aimed at maintaining the ceasefire and that discussions about creating a united nations mission in eastern ukraine continue. warning member states of the dangers of a “multipolar” arms race, he called on the democratic people’s republic of korea to follow up its words with deeds and reaffirmed his country’s commitment to the iran nuclear deal and to maintaining economic exchanges with iran. the united nations must tackle the root causes of conflict, including climate change. “action based solely on nationalism, with the objective of putting ‘my country first’ reaches its limits here,” he said, affirming his commitment to the paris agreement and calling on the security council to make climate change a priority. he called for a “quantum leap” in post‑conflict peacebuilding and said germany would give at least €25 million to the peacebuilding fund this year. he demanded accountability for human rights violations including the use of chemical weapons and called the international criminal court indispensable because of the message it sends to victims and their perpetrators that justice will prevail."
Ghana,"ghana permanent mission of ghana to the united nations 19 east 47th street new york, n.y. 10017 tel. 212-832-1300 • fax 212-751-6743 ★ statement by the president of the republic of ghana, h.e. nana addo dankwa akufo-addo at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly on wednesday, 26™ september, 2018 new york madam president, secretary-general, your excellencies, ghana salutes the historical significance of your election to preside over this 73"""" session of the general assembly as the first female latin american, and congratulates you most heartily, madam president. your election reinforces our common preoccupation that gender equality must be a central feature of the global agenda. madam president, thirteen days ago, we laid to rest in his home soil of ghana, kofi annan, the 7""^ secretary-general of the united nations, the first from sub-saharan africa to occupy this exalted position. on behaif of the peopie and government of ghana, i wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the united nations secretariat, led by the secretary-general, his excellency antonio guterres, and the whole world community for the outpouring of grief and condolences that we received on the passing of kofi annan. we were deeply touched that so many world leaders and peopie took the trouble to come to accra to bid him farewell. kofi annan's passionate and profound belief in the united nations, and his certainty that a better organized and stronger un would make the world a better place, is an ideal that should not be allowed to die. today, we continue to be faced with the stark reality that resolutions, norms and any number of votes in the security council and general assembly mean nothing without the political will to enforce them. we are still to come to terms with what the role of our organization should be. should it just be a club of nation states that exists to look after their own interests? what of its constitution by ""we the peoples"", as declared in its founding document? does the theme we have chosen for this assembly have any relevance in real life, and do we want to make the united nations relevant to all people? do we want an organization that ensures shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies? or should it remain the place to pass resolutions that are ignored with impunity? 2 ipa g e madam president, when some of the nations of the world gathered in san francisco 73 years ago, and signed the landmark document that created this organization, it was a very different world from what we have today. and i do not refer only to the difference in the numbers in the room on that occasion, nor the difference in the mode of travel that brought the leaders to that meeting and the jet planes that have brought us all to new york this week. nor do i refer to the tweets by which we communicate now, and the elegant handwriting that they employed back in 1945.1 refer to the theme we have drawn up for this general assembly, and wonder if it would have been comprehensible to that group in san francisco. it is a different world we currently live in, and we should accept that this organization must change to suit contemporary needs. madam president, ten years ago as the general assembly was starting its proceedings, the world was plunged into a financial crisis. the first scenes of that crisis were played out on a street not far from where we are gathered, but the consequences were felt and are still being felt around the world, and in small countries like ghana. some say that upheaval lies at the heart of the change in politics and outlook around the world. today, as we speak, a trade war is being stoked between the two largest economies of the world. the consequences will affect those who have had no say, including small countries like ghana. these events provide proof, if some were needed, that ours is an interdependent world. we in ghana (and other parts of the african continent) are determined to pull our country out of poverty and into prosperity. we do not think that a nation needs to remain poor or become poor for others to become prosperous. we believe that there is room, and there are enough resources on this planet for us all to be prosperous. but it does mean that the rules and regulations that we fashion to guide our dealings 3 1p a g e with each other have to be respected by all of us. from the environment to trading rules, we have to accept that there cannot be different set of rules for different countries. thus far, the united nations provides the best vehicle for all nations to address their aspirations and challenges. ghana has always displayed her belief in the united nations and sought to contribute her share in making the organization a successful one. we have embraced the sdgs and integrated the seventeen ambitious goals into our national vision and budget. we intend that ghana will in july 2019, take her turn to present our voluntary national review during the ecosoc high-level political forum, and we will share our successes and challenges as well as opportunities for new and continuing partnerships. madam president, it is important to reiterate that advocating for a world order in which all countries sign up to obey the rules does not mean that we want uniformity. we take pride in what distinguishes us as africans and as ghanaians. 55% of the work of the security council last year had to do with africa. unfortunately, this invariably meant peacekeeping and poverty related issues. we no longer want to be the place that requires peacekeepers and poverty fighting ngos, no matter how noble their motives. our regional bodies, like ecowas, and our continental body, the au, are making systematic efforts, despite significant handicaps, to bring peace and stability to the entire continent, and, sooner rather than later, they will succeed. we know we must get our population educated and trained, and we are setting about it. we must address our infrastructural deficit. the traditional methods of tackling this problem will not provide the answer. we are looking for new ways to resolve it. ghana, like many countries in africa, is 4 ipa ge forging relations with china to make arrangements to help address part of our infrastructure deficit. this is not a uniquely ghanaian or african phenomenon. it has not been lost on us that the developed, rich and weii-estabiished countries have been paying regular visits to china, and seeking to open new economic ties and improve upon existing ones. it is also not lost on us that a lot of anxiety is being expressed about the possibility of a recoionization of the african continent by a new power. we should, indeed, learn from history. it was at the turn of the 20""' century that china's first railways were built by western companies, financed by western loans to a nearly bankrupt qing dynasty, and it was under those circumstances that a certain strategic port called hong kong was leased for 99 years, and the rest, as the saying goes, is history. today, the former victim of western railways imperialism is lending billions to countries throughout asia, africa and europe to construct not only railroads, but also highways, ports, power plants and other infrastructure, and many businesses. the historical echoes are certainly worrisome, but, yes, surely, we must and can learn from history. we, in ghana, must build roads, bridges, railways, ports, schools, hospitals, and we must create jobs to keep our young people engaged. it is obvious to us that the development trajectory we had been on for many decades is not working. we are trying a different one, and we would appreciate the support and goodwill of the world, especially in helping to stem the huge flow of iiiicit funds from the continent. it is in everybody's interest that we, who are counted amongst the poor of the world, make a rapid transformation from poverty to prosperity. we are determined in ghana, and, increasingly, in more and more parts of africa, 5 ipa g e to chart our own paths to prosperity, and pay our own way in the worid. we are no ionger interested in being a burden on others. we will shoulder our own responsibilities and build societies and nations that will be attractive to our youth. we have the necessary sense of enterprise, creativity, innovation and hard work to engineer this transition. hence, our vision of a ghana beyond aid, indeed, of an africa beyond aid. madam president, it is equally important that the united nations is reformed to be able to preside over this changed and changing world to which we all aspire. the powerful nations must be willing to adapt to the changes to make our worid a better place. after all, we ail inhabit the same planet, and we ail owe the same duty of care to ensure its survival. the african common position on un reform, as expressed in the ezulwini consensus, remains the most comprehensive proposal for reform of the united nations, particularly of the security council. it is time the global community endorsed it to create a modern united nations fit for purpose in our time. may god bless the united nations and us all. i thank you for your attention. 6 ipa g e","nana addo dankwa akufo-addo, president of ghana, said that kofi annan’s passionate and profound belief in the united nations and his certainty that a better organized and stronger organization would make the world a better place is an ideal that should not be allowed to die. the international community

well-established countries have been paying regular visits to china, seeking to open new economic ties and improve upon existing ones. a lot of anxiety is being expressed about the possibility of a

Greece,"permanent mission of greece to the united nations 866 avenue,13'^ floor • new york,ny 10017-2905 e-mail: |grdel.un@mfa.gr www.mfa.gr/im seventy-third session of the general assembly of the united nations agenda item 8 statement by h.e. mr.alexis tsipras prime minister of the hellenic republic new york friday,september 28,2018 madame president, mr secretary general, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, three years ago, when i first had the honor of addressing the plenary of the general assembly, i had underlined that greece was at the forefront of three overlapping international crises. crises that had a severe impact on greek society, economy and the countr/s diplomatic role in the region. greece was the country most hard-hit by the eurozone crisis, losing 25% of its gdp, reaching over 27% unemployment and significant levels of poverty. greece was also the country that, per capita, carried the heaviest burden in europe from the refugee crisis, as over 1,2 million people entered its islands within a period of a few months. greece found itself also at the center of a worsening crisis of destabilization in the balkans and the eastern mediterranean, with nationalism growing rapidly. on the other hand, the question for me at the time of my speech in 2015 — as for all of us - was whether the un, the international community and our international institutions, would be able to help overcome these common challenges through collective solutions. the question was whether the eu, the ecb,the imf, the world trade organization and the world bank, would guide us to sustainable growth, help decrease poverty and promote more balanced global trade. the question was whether the eu, the unhcr, the lom, would help to resolve the refugee and migration crisis, effectively and humanely. the question was whether the un,the eu, nato or the osce would promote peace and stability, weaken international terrorism and resolve conflicts in my region and many others. nevertheless in the years that followed, what came to the fore was a very big ""trust deficit"" vis-a-vis international and national institutions, as the secretary general called it. in this context, nationalist forces became stronger and stronger and succeeded, finally, in reframing the question. their aggressive stance highlighted that the question was not whether we can count on international institutions to solve common problems on the basis of common values, but whether these problems and values are common at all. their logic in confronting these crises was simple -""not in my backyard"". in dealing with the eurozone crisis, these forces called for grexit and the need to make an example of greece. in dealing with the refugee crisis, they supported the unilateral closure of borders in the balkan route, they demanded push backs in the sea and called for a small schengen that excluded the front line eu countries. in dealing with crises in the broader region the solutions they proposed were also simplistic - sanctions, preventive or humanitarian wars and when those led to a dead end, disengagement from the region and containment of problems to avoid spillover. in greece, we confronted dynamically, not only these challenges, but also these ideas and policies. not only did we manage to stay standing, overcoming these difficulties, but beyond that — we became part of the solution, rather than the problem, in europe and the broader region. we did this without succumbing to the directives of countries, forces and institutions that disregarded the will of the greek people in favor of their own economic or geopolitical interests. at the same time we did this without resorting to a nationalist politics that would lead us to leaving the eurozone, escalating tensions with neighbors or violating human rights and international law. firstly, as regards the economy, we remained in the eurozone but we carried out tough negotiations for an economic program that centered on necessary structural reforms and not on the perpetuation of punitive and exhausting austerity. at the same time we protected labor rights, we are establishing a respectable minimum wage, while guaranteeing fiscal space to support the welfare state and those most vulnerable. today we have left behind us economic programs that perpetuated recession, our growth rates are at 2,1% this year, going on 2,5% next year, unemployment has fallen by 8%, tourism has reached over 34 million visits per year, we are overachieving on high budget surpluses, while investors' interest is growing steadily. greece is becoming a regional energy, commercial and transport hub, changing the energy map and developing its strategic assets. secondly, as concerns the refugee crisis. we had to deal with the highest refugee flows in post-war european history. we did this while respecting international law and human rights. at the same time,though, we supported a difficult but necessary eu-turkey statement. we did not give in to nationalist and xenophobic voices that called for push backs in the sea or a superficial asylum process aimed at rejecting everyone. but we also did not hesitate to accept that those who do not need international protection must return to their transit country in which they are safe. we severely criticized those european countries that reject their responsibility in taking up their fair share of the burden. those countries that call for unity when it comes to having rights but, but see things differently when it comes to fulfilling responsibilities. the people of greece, despite their difficulties, opened their arms to incoming migrants, showing the world what solidarity means. while our asylum authority - which didn't even exist five years ago - deals today with the highest per capita number of applicants in europe. most importantly, today, deaths in the aegean have nearly reached zero and migrant flows have fallen radically. thirdly, concerning the security crisis. we confronted grave challenges because of the rapid destabilization, the strengthening of nationalism and increase in tensions in a region in which we already had important differences with neighboring countries. in this geopolitical context greece retained a policy of protecting its sovereign rights and interests. at the same time, though, it chose to become, together with cyprus, the most important european pillar of peace,security and stability in the region. we have established dynamic trilateral schemes of cooperation with egypt, israel, jordan, lebanon and palestine. and we clearly gave the message that dialog, cooperation and respect for international law, is the only way to foster stable bilateral relations and strengthen the prospects of the region. we remained committed to this policy, also in our difficult relations with turkey, refusing again and again to give in to nationalism and escalation of tensions. a position that allowed us to free the important potential of our relations in security, migration, energy and the economy. but at the same time, a position that made clear the need for respect of international law in the aegean and the eastern mediterranean. in this context, we clearly expressed and express our full support for a just and viable solution to the cyprus issue, on the basis of un decisions. a solution that will be based on the framework of the un secretary general, where we left our important negotiations in crans montana. in parallel, we are actively promoting stability and economic growth in the balkans, through a policy of resolving issues with our neighbors that unlocks their perspective to join the eu and other international organizations of their choice. through our dialog with albania, but, most importantly, through the prespes agreement with our northern neighbor. an agreement that is important not only for the region, but also as a model for the peaceful resolution of differences. an agreement that did not come about through the strongest party imposing its will and interests on the other. but through a mutually acceptable arrangement that preserves the dignity of both sides. madame president, i think today, it is high time that we, as an international community, reframe the question for our future: the dilemma is not patriotism or globalism. it is whether or not we will leave our world to a vicious circle of nationalist reaction and regression, which - as our history teach us leads to tragedy-or we will create the conditions for collective, progressive solutions that will respect national and popular sovereignty of each and every country. because a modern, democratic patriotic politics cannot be a politics of passive acceptance of the directives of unaccountable transnational elites. no modern, democratic, patriotic politics can accept as given, an international order that reproduces inequalities of power and wealth, or protects the right of some to have enormous trade surpluses at the expense of others. where some countries impose their will and interests on others, in the name of common values no less. this is our position in the eurozone, this is our position towards humanitarian wars in the region and this is our position in relation to our differences with our neighbors. on the other hand, though, a modern, democratic, patriotic politics has to be able to deal with 21^ century global and regional challenges. challenges that are common by their very nature and can only be dealt with collectively, on the basis of shared values. we believe that a modern, democratic patriotic politics, must be based on collective arrangements and guarantees that preserve and promote peace, stability, sustainable growth and human rights. it should not be based on a logic of unilateralism, nationalism and strengthening the powerful over the weak. that means making sure that international organizations, including financial ones, become more be accountable and respond to the actual needs of states and citizens. it means supporting the secretary general's vision for un reform. but it also means supporting the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, the global compact on migration, the paris accord on climate change and the iran nuclear deal, despite all its weaknesses. it means finding a political solution in syria on the basis of an inclusive political dialog under un auspices. it means revitalizing the middle east peace process aiming at a comprehensive solution that responds to israel's just demand for security and the palestinians'just demand for a state on the basis of the 1967 borders, with east jerusalem as their capital. it means promoting the valuable dialog between european and euroatlantic institutions and member states with russia, on the basis of mutual respect and with the goal of confronting international challenges and regional crises. it means promoting peace and development in africa, supporting countries that carry the biggest burden in hosting refugees - such as turkey, lebanon and jordan - and confronting the root causes of migration. it means supporting positive steps for a diplomatic solution on denuclearization in the korean peninsula. it means- particularly as we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights - pushing forward the human rights agenda. as greece has after all done: by granting citizenship to second generation immigrants born and raised in our country, by establishing the legal recognition of gender identity and the institutionalization of civil partnership and the deepening the rights of the muslim minority. madame president, nelson madela, whose hundred years of birth we celebrate today, once said ""it always seems impossible until it is done"". for the last 8 years greece was hit hard by three global crises. it confronted decisively, the logic that said each one of our countries has to deal alone with global challenges if they reach our doorstep. today, although greece still faces big challenges in the economy, migration management and diplomacy, it stands again on its feet, bringing solutions to the region. this would not have happened without a politics that asserts popular and national sovereignty, but also commits to collective solutions aimed at peace, stability and preserving human rights. the challenge of our time is to find again this balance as an international community, confronting international forces that spread fear, hatred and - in the end- scale back the progress we have made collectively in the last 70 years. and this is a genuinely modern,democratic and patriotic choice. a choice whose aim will be to ensure that our countries progress and prosper, rather than be pitted against each other. our civilization as greeks, leaves no space for doubt as to the choice we will support. the greek people will be standing, once again, on the right side of history.","alexis tsipras, prime minister of greece, recalled that his country faced three overlapping international crises in recent years. it was the country most hard‑hit by the eurozone crisis, and lost 25 per cent of its gross domestic product; it was the european country that carried the heaviest burden of the refugee crisis per capita; and it has been at the center of a worsening destabilization in the balkans and the eastern mediterranean. in this context, nationalist forces became stronger, and succeeded in reframing the debate. the question is no longer whether we can count on international institutions to solve common problems based on shared values, but rather whether these problems and values are common at all. yet, “not only did we manage to stay standing, overcoming these difficulties, but beyond that we became part of the solution,” he stated, stressing that his country avoided nationalist politics and resisted the directives of those who disregard the will of the greek people to advance their own interests. his country remained in the eurozone by carrying out tough negotiations for an economic program that centered on necessary structural reforms and eschewed the perpetuation of punitive and exhausting austerity, he continued. greece also protected labor rights and established a respectable minimum wage, while guaranteeing fiscal space to support the welfare state and those who are most vulnerable. highlighting growth rates now at 2.1 per cent and the unemployment rate’s 8 per cent fall, he emphasized that his country is becoming a regional energy, commercial and transport hub. “we are overachieving on high budget surpluses while investors’ interest is growing steadily,” he stated. greece dealt with the highest refugee flows in post‑war european history while respecting international law and human rights, he said. without giving in to nationalist and xenophobic voices that called for push-backs, his country supported the difficult but necessary european union‑turkey statement, while accepting that those who do not need international protection return to transit countries where they are safe. “the people of greece, despite their difficulties, opened their arms to incoming migrants, showing the world what solidarity means,” he stated. he also underlined that, while the greek asylum authority did not exist five years ago, it deals today with the highest per capita number of applicants in europe, adding that deaths in the aegean have nearly reached zero and migrant flows have fallen radically. turning to the security crisis in his region, he pointed out that his country established trilateral schemes of cooperation with egypt, israel, jordan, lebanon and palestine. in its difficult relations with turkey, greece has remained committed to the principle that cooperation and respect for international law is the only way to foster stable bilateral relations. stressing the need to respect international law in the aegean sea and the eastern mediterranean, he reaffirmed his full support for a just and viable solution to the cyprus issue based on united nations decisions. greece is actively promoting stability and economic growth in the balkans through a dialog with albania and the prespa agreement with its northern neighbor, “a mutually acceptable arrangement that preserves the dignity of both sides”, he noted. “the dilemma is not patriotism or globalism,” he went on to say. rather, the choice facing the international community is leaving the world to a vicious circle of national reactions and regressions that leads to tragedy, or creating the conditions for collective, progressive solutions that respect the national and popular sovereignty of each country. “challenges that are common by their very nature […] can only be dealt with collectively, on the basis of shared values,” he affirmed. in that spirit, he called on international organizations to be more accountable and respond to the needs of states and citizens. further, he expressed support for the 2030 agenda, the global compact on migration, the paris agreement and the joint comprehensive plan of action. stressing the need to push forward the human rights agenda, he pointed out that greece has established citizenship for second‑generation immigrants, legal recognition of gender identity, institutionalized civil partnership and deepened rights for the muslim community."
Grenada,"statement by h.e. mr. c. peter david minister for foreign affairs and labor of grenada grenada’s statement 73rd session unga theme making the un relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies salutations madam president, mr. secretary general, heads of government & delegations, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, i am pleased to extend the usual warm greetings from the government and people of grenada, on whose behalf i am privileged to address this noble institution and its distinguished members. madam president, i join those before me in congratulating you on your 1 election as president of this 73rd general assembly. i am confident in your stewardship and assure you of my delegation’s cooperation and support. i am also pleased to join esteemed colleagues before me in thanking the outgoing president of the 72nd session of the general assembly, his excellency miroslav lajcak for his able and focused leadership. indeed, i must also congratulate and thank secretary-general antonio guterres, for his leadership of the united nations; and to express our deep gratitude especially, for the keen interest shown in the developmental challenges facing small island developing states. madam president, the government and people of grenada join others around the world in mourning the passing of former united nations secretary-general, kofi annan. mr. annan, who served the united nations with distinction, was the consummate diplomat and international statesman, who resolutely defended the ideals of international peace and security. 2 the former un secretary-general was a humanitarian who worked tirelessly to ensure that disadvantaged persons around the world were afforded their human rights. madam president, mr. annan’s wise and courageous leadership helped place the issue of sustainable development on the international agenda, through the millennium development goals. the mdgs have since evolved into the sustainable development goals, another globally agreed upon framework designed to push the international development agenda. madam president, we are acutely aware of how critical development issues are for small island developing states like grenada and we are indebted to kofi for initiating and spearheading this historic global movement. today, as we mourn his loss, we are comforted by the fact that his legacy will continue to inspire generations of leaders around the world. madam president, there’s one particular quote from brother kofi that resonates deeply and is very relevant to this year’s unga theme: “to live is to choose. but to choose well, you must know who you are and what you stand for, where you want to go and why you want to get there.” madam president, as member states of this noble body, we must deliberately choose to make the united nations relevant to all peoples. 3 we must also choose a deliberate path to global leadership that promotes shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. madam president, grenada also joins with the rest of the un community in honoring the late south african hero and international statesman, nelson mandela, on this the centenary of his birth. this tribute comes at a time when the international community is looking to leaders who understand the necessity of fostering international solidarity and cooperation; leaders who bring people together and who sacrifice for the greater good. the global community has no better example of this than the late great, madiba. it is our hope that leaders everywhere will work diligently to uphold his staunch legacy of promoting peace, equality and human dignity. madam president, our assembly is occurring in a global context characterized by changing political, ideological and religion-based tensions, social revolution, and an increasing anxiety about economic, social and political inequality and marginalization. these global changes are magnified, especially for developing states, in the face of challenging phenomena such as climate change, natural 4 disasters, and non-communicable diseases. with limited access to development financing, these challenges are further exacerbated. pursuing policies and strategies for confronting these challenges with the corresponding extraordinary solutions must be the most imperative means towards securing more sustainable societies. climate-smart sustainability madam president, we are well into the 2018 hurricane season; yet, the caribbean is still recovering from one of the most devastating hurricane seasons in 2017. we held our breath as this year’s various tropical systems—beryl, isaac, and only this week, kirk—took aim at our region. such weather systems are yet another reminder of the vulnerability of the region and the realities of climate change, capable of eviscerating whole industries in a matter of hours. this is especially evident in our region, which is heavily dependent on agriculture and tourism, and in which any damage to property or infrastructure is significant. yet, madam president, there is hope. too often we talk about the disadvantages of small nations. the global climate challenge offers us an opportunity to not only highlight our 5 vulnerability but to also focus on the distinct advantages of being small states. the caribbean and other sids can serve as test cases for nationwide implementation of climate-related technologies and advances. we also represent some of the most globally compelling business cases for sustainable renewable energy investment. being climate smart goes beyond policies. it goes beyond resilient housing, resilient infrastructure and resilient agriculture. it means that the region can also serve as a global beacon for renewable energy and energy efficiency. we aim to not only be resilient, but with our region’s tremendous potential in hydro-electricity and geothermal energy, we could also be climate smart. in understanding the need to rethink our adaptation to climate change, the government of grenada has established a new over-arching ministry, titled the ministry of climate resilience, environment, fisheries, forestry, disaster management and information. its mandate is to work speedily to ensure that engrained in every aspect of our country’s development is the question of addressing climate change and climate resilience. 6 grenada is also currently shifting some of its macroeconomic focus to ensure attention is paid to the development of our green and blue economies; thus, marrying economic development with environmental sustainability. the road to climate-smart sustainability is long and arduous, but it is not insurmountable, and we must ensure that we are strategic in this journey. health madam president, in building climate-smart and sustainable societies, we cannot discount the inherent need to improve the health of our citizens and the conditions for fostering good health. unfortunately, like many caricom states and other developing nations, grenada struggles with the scourge of non-communicable diseases. madam president, to avoid repeating some of the alarming health statistics with which we are confronted and developmentally challenged, i only wish to emphasize that our government calls for global leadership and looks forward to international solutions that would preserve the health of our people, promote longevity and sustain our future. 7 indeed, the successful completion of this week’s high-level meetings on non-communicable diseases and tuberculosis is encouraging, particularly the commitments set forth in the political declarations, laudably adopted by consensus. now is the time to scale up our efforts to ensure we honor those commitments. finance madam president, as we attempt to create sustainable societies, we are confronted with certain global financial policies and actions that pose significant threats to our region’s sustainable development. correspondent banking and de-risking, blacklisting and middle-income status graduation are measures that negatively affect caribbean economies. madam president, the unilateral, and premature graduation of many small island developing states to middle income status without consideration of our region’s specific vulnerabilities has resulted in significant budgetary shortfalls, adversely affecting our economic and social development. madam president, our region has inherent structural economic challenges that already restrict the pace of our development. we ask that these 8 impediments to growth be considered when our matters arise for consideration. madam president, the caribbean development bank has pioneered the use of vulnerability indices when setting the terms of its financing. likewise, we urge international partners to work toward an acceptable ‘country vulnerability index’ that holistically assesses our countries’ development and risks. moreover, the withdrawal of correspondent banking services to caricom member states, can be seen as an economic assault that would destabilize the financial sector of our already vulnerable economies. remittances contribute in real and significant terms to the gdp of small states. in fact, the world bank has stated that any sudden stop in remittances in economies that rely on these flows could pose a significant threat to socio-economic stability. added to the threat of lost correspondent banking relationships, we also have to contend with the unilateral and often unfounded blacklisting of our institutions as “money launderers” and our countries as “tax havens.” 9 it pains us as policy-makers when we expend our limited resources to comply with international rules, only to face arbitrary punishments when we are quite evidently doing our best. there are no easy answers to these challenges, but i urge our partners to desist from draconian approaches to these matters when dealing with vulnerable developing nations. international security madam president, grenada continues to work with our international partners to advance international peace and security. grenada’s position on the development of nuclear weapons is clear. the development of nuclear weapons is inherently destructive, and, therefore, serves no good purpose for humanity. deterrence only makes sense where there is the possibility of deployment. the mere existence of these weapons anywhere, is unacceptable. grenada, therefore, urges its friends to desist from the development and testing of these weapons. imagine what we could achieve instead, if we put our brilliant scientists to work on climate change and building climate-smart resilient and sustainable societies. small arms madam president, as we strive to maintain the caribbean region as a zone of peace, some of us continue to be affected by the trafficking of small 10 arms from the countries that manufacture and sell these arms freely. in some of our islands, states-of-emergency have been declared at various times, to control criminal activity, because of the increasing availability and use of small arms. madam president, small arms and gun violence undermine the rule of law and are often major factors behind the displacement of civilians and the violation of human rights. madam president, we cannot build sustainable societies if our public security is incessantly threatened by this scourge. madam president, the main purpose of united nations is to maintain international peace and security and to prevent violence and war. indeed, in the united nations charter there are only 5 references to “war”, while it refers to “peace” 47 times. madam president, this is extremely instructive to us, and, therefore, it is imperative that the global leadership take decisive action. indeed, as we strive to create sustainable societies, the people of cuba continue to suffer under the unjust decades-old embargo imposed on them by the united states of america. grenada continues to call for the 11 immediate lifting of the unfair economic, commercial, and financial embargo on the republic of cuba. madam president, as such, grenada strongly supports general assembly resolution 70/5, which calls for an end to this dreadful embargo. madam president, some of our neighbors in latin america are currently experiencing political and economic challenges, which threaten the peaceful existence, sustainable development, and by extension, the stability of the region. grenada calls for dialog and asks that good sense and wisdom prevail in all attempts aimed at resolving these conflicts. in the same vein, we call for the political integrity and sovereignty of these states to be respected. the government of grenada continues to offer its hand in good faith to facilitate dialog towards the settlement of said disputes. madam president, as i close, i implore that we be relentless in our pursuit of the purposes of this organization. our quest must be for the pursuit of economic opportunities, as we strive to achieve peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies for all. these ideals will be out of our reach if we do not promote, encourage, and dare i say insist on resolute global 12 leadership in solving our developmental challenges that transcend boundaries. i thank you. 13","c. peter david, minister for foreign affairs of grenada, said the world must choose a deliberate path to global leadership that promotes shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies while addressing pressing challenges, from religion-based tensions to climate change. such global challenges are magnified in developing states, exacerbated by their limited access to development financing. in the caribbean region, which is still recovering from the 2017 hurricane season, there is hope. global climate challenges offer small countries the opportunity to highlight vulnerabilities and strengths by serving as test cases for the nationwide implementation of climate-related technologies and advances. small island developing states also represent some of the most globally compelling business cases for sustainable renewable energy investment. for its part, grenada has already taken steps to rise to the challenges it faces. the government aims at being climate smart and going beyond policies, he said, highlighting the establishment of the ministry of climate resilience, environment, fisheries, forestry, disaster management and information. part of its mandate aims at speedily ensuring that every aspect of the country’s development addresses climate change and resilience. efforts must be made to address the scourge of non-communicable diseases, he said, calling for global leadership to find solutions. turning to financial concerns, he cited the negative effects on caribbean economies of correspondent banking, de-risking, blacklisting and middle-income country graduation. the unilateral graduation of many small island developing states to middle-income status without considering the region’s vulnerabilities has already resulted in budgetary shortfalls that are adversely affecting economic and social development. while there are no easy answers to those challenges, he urged partners to desist from draconian approaches, such as blacklisting institutions as “money launderers” and countries as “tax havens”, as well as related arbitrary punishments. on security, he said the caribbean is a zone of peace and supports ending nuclear-weapon testing and arms trafficking. “small arms and gun violence undermine the rule of law and are often major factors behind the displacement of civilians and the violation of human rights,” he said. as the world strives to create sustainable societies, he highlighted challenges in the region. cuba continues to face embargos, which should be lifted. some neighbors in latin american are currently experiencing political and social challenges that threaten peace, sustainable development and the region’s stability. grenada continues to offer its hand to facilitate dialog towards the settlement of disputes."
Guatemala,,"jimmy morales, president of guatemala, expressed appreciation for the solidarity shown by the international community and humanitarian organizations with his country, which in 3 june suffered human losses and material damages in the wake of a volcano eruption. today is an opportunity to reflect on the role of the united nations in the world order. his country prides itself in its strong will to peacefully resolve territorial issues. over the past century and a half, it has had a maritime dispute with belize. in 2018, a popular vote was held, with 96 per cent of voters in favor of bringing the case to the international court of justice. he welcomed a decision by belize to set a date for their vote in 2019 and eagerly awaits the outcome of their vote. the resolution of this dispute will bring economic and social benefits to both nations. he said central america’s economic integration continues to progress. in 2018, a historic step was made with the establishment of the customs union between guatemala, honduras and el salvador, meaning that more than 80 per cent of the bilateral trade will enjoy free transit of goods thanks to tariff harmonization. this integration turned three countries into one market with 32 million people. according to world bank data, the border crossing time was reduced from 55‑60 hours to 15 minutes. guatemala’s fight against transnational threats is unprecedented in the region, he continued. in the last two years, guatemalan security forces, in collaboration with state agencies in the united states, seized more than 471 million poppy plants, with a value of $1.4 billion, and seized 34,000 kilos of cocaine, and 400 per cent more heroin than in previous years. this meant it seized more drugs in the last two years than in the last eight years combined. guatemala has made significant progress in combating corruption and improving transparency. its initiative and open government mechanism has now moved to the third national action plan 2016‑2018. guatemala worked hard to meet the international standards of tax transparency and ratified a convention, which moves guatemala out of the list of countries considered as tax havens. guatemala respects the sovereignty of other countries, he said. after four decades of internal armed conflict, his country moved to the harder task of building and maintaining peace. the international commission against impunity in guatemala (cicig) was created in december 2006, when the united nations and his country signed an agreement setting up the commission as an independent body charged with investigating and prosecuting serious crimes in guatemala. although the body has helped strengthen his country’s democratic institutions, his government has decided not to extend its mandate because it has interfered in the internal affairs of guatemala. he also denounced the excessive use of force and power by the commission and illegal pretrial detention, requesting the united nations secretary-general appoint a new commissioner for the body. guatemala has designed a technology called “biobars” whose objective is to decontaminate rivers, beaches, seas and oceans, he said. the country continues to work hard in the implementation of the 2016‑2020 national strategy for prevention of chronic malnutrition, which is directly related to the objectives of sustainable development — putting an end to hunger, achieving food security and improving nutrition."
Guinea,,"mamadi touré, minister for foreign affairs of guinea said that the united nations is the sole multilateral platform that can adopt a concerted global approach to the world’s many challenges. while supporting the secretary-general’s reform process in peace, security and development, he said guinea can never insist enough on security council reform, as it is time to recognize the political and economic importance of africa by conferring the role it can play on the international scene. he said the injustice inflicted upon the continent must be redressed by conferring two permanent and two non-permanent african seats. as it celebrates its sixtieth anniversary of its independence, he said guinea is “flying the flag of pan-africanism”, noting a history including the battle against apartheid and the promotion of peace and security and socioeconomic development on the continent. guinea is making major economic and social progress, with mega-projects in the energy and agricultural sectors and infrastructure promising a better future for its people. under the aegis of the 2030 agenda and the african union’s agenda 2063, the country aims to implement the sustainable development goals and counts on the support of the international community. expressing appreciation for a new climate favoring sustainable peace in africa, he pointed to progress in managing crises in guinea-bissau, south sudan and somalia. progress in resolving disputes between ethiopia and eritrea, and eritrea and djibouti, confirm that the world must prioritize political solutions to create an environment for development. nonetheless, positive developments must not distract from the shared fight against terrorism. condemning barbaric acts committed against innocent populations of africa and worldwide, he urged major powers to support the g-5 sahel framework. he commended the sahel: land of opportunities program promoting a more prosperous future for 10 african countries. however, the conflict in the middle east remains a major preoccupation for the international community. stating guinea has always unambiguously expressed unconditional solidarity for the just cause of the palestinian people, he called for a two-state solution with safe, internationally recognized borders. protracted crises worldwide have generated humanitarian needs estimated at $22.5 billion, but that aid is hampered by drastic united nations funding cuts. he hailed the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration as the hope for 258 million migrants worldwide, largely women and children. it will strike a balance between state sovereignty and human rights. however, he noted that achieving social well-being and sustainable development is impossible without ridding the world of recurring diseases. although the world must strengthen the fight against transmissible and non-transmissible diseases, he applauds progress made against such diseases as tuberculosis and hiv/aids. however, creating inclusive societies also requires gender equality, as empowering youth and women in economic activities is vital to achieving sustainable development. noting that the secretary-general is working to achieve parity in high-ranking positions in the united nations, he declared that initiative fully in line with agreements on women’s empowerment. multilateralism remains the sole path towards realizing the objectives of the united nations charter."

mandela ""madiba"" and had the opportunity to reflect on the life and accomplishments of this great humanist. the former south african president was an example of courage, abnegation, and tolerance. mandela fought for freedom, justice, democracy, and a society where all people may live together with equality and in harmony. this is a great lesson that will continue to serve as a source of inspiration for us and future generations. madam president, honorable heads of state and government, in his last report on the organization's republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency activities, the secretary-general reminds us that, for many peoples, peace is still a goal that is difficult to reach. as our much-missed kofi annan said: ""peace is a hung dream."" indeed, many conflicts persist around the world, and many people continue to suffer the destruction of war. many deaths, including those of children, and millions of people who are forced to abandon their homes, their cities, in search of asylum, leaving part of their families and possessions acquired during a lifetime of work. we cannot remain indifferent to so much suffering and despair by thousands of people, including children, seeking protection and asylum, particularly in europe. the situation in palestine, as well as yemen and syria, continue to be a source of great concern for the international community. in the african continent, internal tensions caused by terrorist group activities, particularly in the sahel, which are spreading fear among 4 republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency the population and preventing their governments from focusing on development issues, and on creating the best life conditions for their citizens. climate change has caused increasingly more frequent droughts and floods in many parts of the world. many island countries face the risks of disappearing due to rising sea levels. these challenges require from ail of us efforts, new attitudes, and more responsible behaviors. above all, we must rigorously meet the commitments undertaken in the paris accord. madam president, i believe that we all have an obligation under the charter of the united nations to which we ail subscribe, and must respect it whatever the circumstances, as the principles contained therein are the foundation and basis for a world order based on rules. specifically, the principle republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency of peaceful resolution of disputes, the non interference in countries, and the internal affairs of other multilateralism as the cornerstone to build international peace and security. we live in a global village, where all are responsible, not only for what happens within our own territories, given the interdependence of countries. one country's national policies may gravely affect all other countries. this demands shared responsibility. in this regard, i must not fail to address the issue of security council reform, particularly better representation of the african continent, in order to enhance the legitimacy of this principal united nations organization. madam president, republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency honorable heads of state and government, ladies and gentlemen, i wish to take this opportunity before this august assembly to briefly share the current political situation in guinea-bissau, as well as results achieved. last april, in lome, togo, as the heads of state and government of the economic community of west african states, we arrived at an important decision toward permanently overcoming the political and constitutional impasse that had been in place in my country for more than three years. as head of state, and in the name of building peace and stability in my country and the subregion, i have pursued the recommendations coming out of the conference, namely: • appointment minister; of the consensus prime republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency scheduling of a date for legislative elections on november 18, 2018; these recommendations have been fully implemented, with the following results! • the formation of a government of inclusion in accordance with the conakry agreement; • the reopening of our national people's assembly; • the extension of the terms of assembly members; • the election of the members of the national electoral commission (cne); • the approval of the government program and the general state budget; madam president, recent political, social, and economic events bear witness that the bissau-guinean people and republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency our armed forces, together (mobilized), said no to instability and embarked on a path of peace and development. the process for our elections on november 18*^ is underway, and we started to register voter on the 19*^ of this month, despite some delays due to technical and financial reasons. please note that, for the first time in the history of our bissau-guinean democracy, a legislative session has been completed without any interruptions caused by coup d'etats and/or other incidents. accordingly, on this past august 30*^, the security council took notice of the positive developments in the political stability in our country. i would also note that, as in previous reports, we were congratulated on the republican attitudes of the armed forces, which has displayed a notable sense of civic duty in recent years. i take this opportunity to appeal to the republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency international community and the members of the security council, which has exclusive prerogatives with respect to this matter, in the name of justice and nationai harmony, for the iifting of sanctions imposed on some officiais of our armed forces. such decision, which has been desired and expected for so long, would certainly help to consolidate our democratic institutions and to bring about lasting peace in our country. madam president, heads of delegations, peace is essential for successful development. but peace is not just the absence of armed conflict. there can be no peace when a iarge portion, if not most, of the population, particularly women and youth, are not sufficiently valued, when their education is considered iess important, when their contribution to the economic growth 10 republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency of our country is not recognized or fairly compensated, when women are not, in parity with men, in positions of influence, and are ignored as the pillar of society. in my country, we recently took significant steps toward ensuring equal representation for men and women. the parliament of guinea- bissau approved a law that guarantees a minimum representation quota of 36% for women in positions of note, particularly in the national people's assembly and in government. as president of the republic and guarantor of national equity and unity, i am particularly pleased and grateful for these national advances. madam president, ladies and gentiemen, i would like to conclude my remarks by reaffirming guinea-bissau's commitment to the 11 republic of guinea-bissau office of the presidency principles enshrined in the charter of the united nations and to the important, unique, and irreplaceable role of our organization. we must join forces in order to better manage globalization, eradicate poverty and hunger, combat major endemic diseases, as well as guarantee education and potable water for all in order to implement the sustainable development goals by 2030. let us be solidary and demonstrate our compassion for those who are fleeing persecution, war, and misery, particularly migrants and refugees, victims of political crises and natural calamities, who are desperately knocking on our doors. in a solidary and brotherly world, we will be in a better position to build a better future for future generations. thank you very much! 12 866 un plaza, suite 481 new york, n.y.10017 tel:1.212.896.8311 fax:1.212.896.8313","josé mário vaz, president of guinea‑bissau, expressed concern that many conflicts persist around the world and many people continue to suffer the destruction of war. millions die or are forced to abandon their homes in search of asylum, he said, emphasizing that “we cannot remain indifferent to so much suffering and despair”. spotlighting the plight of those seeking asylum in europe as well as those in palestine, yemen and syria — which continues to be a major source of concern for the international community — he said that on the african continent, internal tensions caused by terrorist groups especially in the sahel region spread fear among populations and prevent governments from focusing on development issues. noting that climate change is increasingly causing more frequent droughts and floods in many parts of the globe, he said many island countries face the risk of disappearance due to rising sea levels. “these challenges require from all of us efforts, new attitudes and more responsible behaviors,” he stressed, calling on nations to rigorously meet their commitments undertaken as part of the paris agreement. spotlighting the obligations and principles enshrined in the united nations charter — especially those of the peaceful resolution of disputes, the non‑interference in the internal affairs of other countries and multilateralism as the cornerstone of building international peace and security — he also went on to underline the interdependence of countries in today’s world. “one country’s national policies may gravely affect all other countries,” he continued, adding: “this demands shared responsibility.” in that regard, he underlined the importance of reforming the security council in order to ensure better representation of the african continent, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of that principal organ of the united nations. recalling that guinea‑bissau, alongside leaders of the economic community of west african states (ecowas), arrived in 2017 at an agreement to overcome its political and constitutional impasse, he outlined some of the ecowas recommendations including: the appointment of a consensus prime minister; the formation of a government of inclusion; the reopening of the national people’s assembly; and the election of members of a national electoral commission. “recent political, social and economic events bear witness that bissau‑guinean people and armed forces […] said no to instability and embarked on a path of peace and development,” he said. noting that the country is on track to hold elections on 18 november and citing other positive developments, he appealed for the lifting of sanctions imposed on some of guinea‑bissau’s armed forces officials. “we must join forces in order to better manage globalization, eradicate poverty and hunger, combat major endemic diseases, as well as guarantee education and potable water for all” in order to implement the sustainable development goals by 2030, he said."
Guyana,"statement by his excellency mr. carl b. greenidge vice president and minister of foreign affairs cooperative republic of guyana at the seventy-third session of the united nations general assembly friday, september 28, 2018 united nations headquarters mr/madame president, i thank you. i am pleased to extend warmest congratulations to foreign minister maria fernanda espinosa garces and the people of ecuador on the occasion of her preferment to the presidency of our august assembly. that election is all the more gratifying because mme espinosa represents the latin america and the caribbean region. she joins a small but distinguished group of women who have presided over the assembly during the 72 years of its history. guyana pledges its unwavering support to mme president as she discharges her responsibilities. let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to your distinguished predecessor, his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak, for his successful stewardship of the seventy-second session of the assembly. thirdly, 1 would like to take a moment to salute the memory of former secretarygeneral mr. kofi annan, a son of africa and a servant of the peoples of the world, whose dedication to the global community was epitomized in a lifetime of selfless service to the united nations. madame president, guyana is persuaded of the value of multilateralism (sometimes termed liberal multilateralism) within which guyana has operated since independence. this rules-based system with a pivotal role for nation states alongside key international and multilateral institutions is valued by member states. it is largely predictable, based on the rule of law and has enabled extensive economic development and improvements in human welfare across the globe since its establishment after the 1939-45 war. in spite of that success, multilateralism is now under attack in some quarters and there have been recent calls for it to be replaced. some of the challenges feeding such calls are obvious. the rapid expansion in the number of states over the last few decades has contributed to the exponential growth in the number and complexity of decision-making in the page 1 of 8 system. the consequences of the latter have been most evident in some of the very areas in which global multilateral governance have had the greatest success in the past - trade, economic growth and peaceful resolution of conflicts. at the un we are faced with stymied security council reform. the debate about the reforms needed to move us forward and out of this impending cul-de-sac has yielded many ideas. but rather than turning to outdated models, solutions based on misconceived economic goals, or some form of national exceptionalism, we need to explore complementary organizational forms and arrangements that could simplify decisionmaking. in attempts to look outside of the box for solutions some observers have turned to the idea of the inclusion of new partners, such as ngos and social networks working alongside states and governments and/or some degree of regionalization of organizational structures etc - the so-called 'web 2.0' option. it may also be worth exploring other voting rules for decision-making. in other words, we need to fashion a more equitable and just variant of multilateralism rather than its replacement. serious proposals should seek to preserve the valued elements of multilateralism because the more intractable problems we face are beyond the capacity of individual states to solve. it is small wonder then that the secretary-general in his report on the work of the organization asserts that the united nations offers a platform where member states, regional organizations and civil society can find solutions to global problems that no nation acting alone can resolve. working together is not optional. it is the only answer. guyana therefore pledges its full support, [madame] mr. president, for your strategic vision of ""dialog and the strengthening of multilateralism as a catalyst for the well-being of all persons in a sustainable planet"". madame president, page 2 of 8 global governance and peace are inextricably linked. in that regard guyana has noted with satisfaction the efforts of the secretary-general, mr. antonio guterres, in close collaboration with member states, to reform and streamline the machinery of the united nations to make it more fit for purpose. we fully support the reform of the peace and security pillar with its emphasis on preventive diplomacy. peace is also inextricably linked to sustainable development. in this regard, the united nations disarmament agenda is a central tenet in our efforts to achieve a stable, secure and peaceful world order. guyana has demonstrated its commitment to this agenda most recently in its signing and ratification of the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons. we recognize, however, that the commitment of every member state to the disarmament agenda is key to achieving the world to which we aspire and the onus is on all of us to fulfill the obligations we have taken on ourselves by becoming states parties to the various legal instruments concerned with questions of disarmament and non-proliferation. for guyana and the wider caribbean, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and their associated ammunition poses one of the most serious threats to human security and sustainable development. international drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, unregulated cyber space, and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons divert resources that could otherwise be invested in other critical areas. we believe that with effective international cooperation and assistance, small countries like guyana can tackle this illicit trade and ultimately create safer communities, safer countries and regions, and a safer world. madame president, page 3 of 8 adherence to the cardinal principles of the sovereign equality of states, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, and the peaceful resolution of disputes are the most effective guarantees of peace. you will no doubt be aware of the controversy that has arisen between guyana and its neighbor venezuela over the latter's contention that the arbitral award of 1899 that settled the boundaries between the two countries is null and void. on 30 january 2018, secretary-general guterres took the decision that the controversy with the bolivarian republic of venezuela should be referred to the international court of justice. the decision of the secretary-general is binding on the parties. accordingly, in march of this year, guyana filed its application in the court seeking an affirmation of the validity of the 1899 arbitral award and the international boundary that it established. unfortunately, notwithstanding its obligation to do so, venezuela has thus far refused to participate in the proceedings. guyana sincerely hopes that it will change its mind. there is still time for it to do so. guyana wishes to express its gratitude to the secretary-general for his important contribution to the resolution of this longstanding matter and looks forward to a final judgment by the international court of justice. the rule of law must prevail. as a responsible member of the global community, guyana seeks peace not only in our region, but throughout the world where the scourge of war and conflict are an obstacle to development. they divert attention away from the pressing problems of development and the enhancement of human well- being. in the middle east, the region of the world that has given birth to the three great monotheistic religions of our age, we reiterate our call for a twostate solution to the generational conflict between the peoples of palestine page 4 of 8 and israel. these two peoples have much to gain by living side by side in peace. the people of palestine, including the inhabitants of gaza, like people everywhere have a right to life, to a dignified existence and to their own homeland. similarly, madame president, we deplore the suffering being borne by the rohingya population. we call on the international community to take the necessary steps to ensure respect of the human rights of the affected population. at the same time, we salute the efforts of bangladesh to provide a safe haven for the refugee population, with the assistance of international agencies. closer home, in the caribbean region, we again join the overwhelming majority of the international community in calling for the removal of the trade and economic embargo against our sister caribbean nation of cuba, which frustrates the right of the cuban people to development and material well-being. madame president, guyana also welcomes the measures being taken to reposition the united nations development system in order to better align its functioning with the goals set out in the 2030 sustainable development agenda. we accept that repositioning is a shared responsibility and guyana is committed to doing its part. madame president, page 5 of 8 guyana has fully embraced the holistic and people-centered approach to development set out in the sustainable development goals and our nation is currently engaged in efforts to mainstream and integrate those goals into our national development strategy known as the green state development strategy. the gsds seeks to ensure that development is not achieved at the expense of the environment and to wean guyana away from its current near- total dependence on non-renewable sources of energy. we are turning to renewable sources, such as hydroelectricity, wind, solar and biomass. guyana is unalterably committed to the principles of sustainable development and to working with the international community and all partners to help combat the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels. for this reason, guyana strategy is to place emphasis on inclusive transformation, sustainable natural resources, energy transition, resilient infrastructure, institutional human development foundations and and well-being, international government cooperation, trade and and investment. madame president, guyana fully recognizes the necessary, nay critical, contribution of women and girls to its sustainable development. women and girls constitute more than half the world's population and the underutilization of their potential represents a serious loss of resources in the global effort to promote human development. we are trying to ensure that the management of this development is page 6 of 8 undertaken with women and girls fully represented at the helm of decision- making. we applaud the steps taken by the secretary-general to ensure parity in the appointment of senior managers of the organization, including resident coordinators in the field. madame president i wish to express guyana's satisfaction at the successful conclusion this year of the intergovernmental negotiations of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. the provisions of the compact are consistent with the 2030 agenda and the commitments made in the new york declaration for refugees. it is our hope that this global framework will help to manage international migration flows in all their dimensions for the benefit of all states, sending and receiving, and of migrants themselves. guyana looks forward to the successful adoption of the global compact in the intergovernmental conference to be held in december 2018 in marrakesh, morocco. madame president, we meet this year in disconcerting times. our planet, the only one we have, faces grave threats on multiple fronts, including threats to the very existence of life as we know it. as 1 have already hinted, there are many who question whether our organization, the nations of the world united, will be able to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, while promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom and reaffirming faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity page 7 of 8 and worth of the human person, and in the equal rights of men and women. it is for us to decide and to summon the will to work towards those ends. our children and our children's children will judge us. guyana reaffirms its strong resolution to doing its part within the limits of our capacity and resources. i thank you. page 8 of 8","carl greenidge, vice‑president of guyana, said his government remains committed to multilateralism, a principle under attack in some parts of the world. threats to global multilateral governance are present in the united nations and evidenced in stymied security council reform. he urged states to explore comprehensive organizational forms and arrangements that simplify decision‑making, noting that global governance and peace are inexorably linked. voicing his full support for the secretary‑general’s efforts to reform the organization’s security pillar with an emphasis on preventive diplomacy, he said that for guyana, and the region as a whole, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons poses one of the most serious threats to human security and he called for international action against transnational crime. underscoring that the principle of sovereignty is the most effective guarantee of peace, he called attention to boundary disputes with venezuela and the secretary‑general’s decision to have the matter be referred to the international court of justice. however, venezuela refuses to participate in proceedings. guyana seeks peace not only in its region, but throughout the world. he also stressed that conflict is an obstacle to development, calling for a two‑state solution to the israeli‑palestinian crisis. the people of palestine, including gaza, have the right to a dignified existence in their homeland. turning to myanmar, he deplored the suffering being borne by the rohingya population. he also called for the lifting of the embargo on cuba. guyana has fully embraced the holistic and people‑centered approach to development set out in the sustainable development goals, he said, adding that efforts are underway to integrate the goals into national development strategies. the government is working to ensure development is not achieved at the expense of the environment. notwithstanding the fact that guyana will soon become a significant oil producer, there are initiatives aimed at weaning the country from its dependence on non‑renewable energy. he fully recognized the critical contribution of women and girls to sustainable development initiatives. underrepresentation of the potential of women and girls amounts to a serious loss of resources in the global effort to promote human development. he also expressed his satisfaction at the successful conclusion this year of intergovernmental negotiations on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. as member states participate in this year’s general assembly debate, the planet faces grave threats on multiple fronts and there are many that question if the united nations can unite and strengthen international peace and security. for its part, he emphasized guyana’s strong commitment to doing its part to promote those principles within the limits of its capacity and resources."
Haiti,,"jovenel moïse, president of haiti, said that the general assembly faces two underlying questions: how to optimize mechanisms for international peace and security; and how international solidarity can be translated into a more effective system. combating poverty and promoting human rights are inexorably linked and abject poverty is a denial of human dignity. poverty alleviation must be at the heart of the united nations. furthermore, climate change must be a top priority for international leaders; the paris agreement was a major milestone. however, funding is insufficient to respond to challenges and states most affected by violent weather phenomena are those who contribute least to greenhouse gas emissions. one year after the closing of the united nations stabilization mission in haiti, the government continues to work to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights, he continued. no efforts are spared in creating a stable environment conducive to investment and growth. haiti is implementing innovative approaches to make progress possible for all haitians. however, economic growth is apathetic and exerts a heavy burden on development and peacekeeping programs. haiti is also confronting the painful requirement to continue financing government subsidies for petrol prices, he said, recalling that haitians voiced their political discontent in recent violent protests, highlighting how fragile haiti’s progress is. without appropriate, long‑term assistance structural reforms are unsustainable and such reforms will not occur overnight or under rigid limitations imposed by international partners. he attributed recent public anger to narrow approaches to financial assistance and the inability of haiti to obtain the forms of aid it requires. he restated his commitment to spare no effort to guide the country towards sustainable development, including the fight against corruption in all its forms. the government is endeavoring to immediately improve the livelihood of the most vulnerable members of society, improve the business climate, promote job creation, strengthen the capacity of the judicial system and re-establish its armed forces. haiti is at a crossroads, he said, appealing for international partners to demonstrate solidarity with haitians. peace, development and security go hand in hand and require long term investment, he stressed, asking how sustainable development can be achieved with inadequate national infrastructure, including for the provision of potable tap water. he also noted that 15,000 classrooms are needed to provide children with access to quality education and 122 health centers are necessary to overcome lack of access to services in communities across the country."
Holy See,"h. e. archbishop paul rich rd gallagher secretary for relations with states head of the delegation of the holy see to the seventy-third session of the united nations general assembly united nations general assembly hall monday, 1st october 2018 making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies madam president, at the outset, i wish to extend the cordial greetings of his holiness, pope francis, to you and to all the delegations participating in this 73rd session of the un general assembly. as the international community marks the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights on december 10, 1948, it is worthwhile to recall and reemphasize its assertion that the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. 1 indeed, the recognition of the inherent dignity of all human beings is the bedrock on which the pillars of the united nations are grounded. it is the ultimate principle behind the founders determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. 2 it undergirds all fundamental human rights. it drives the search for justice and the respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other appropriate sources of international law, because so many abuses of human dignity begin with a failure to uphold laws that respect human rights and fundamental freedo s. it spurs individuals and societies to achieve social 1 preamble of the universal declaration of human rights. 2 preamble of the charter of the united nations. progress and better standards of life in greater freedom through what the holy see calls integral human development.3 to speak of human dignity seventy years after the adoption of the universal declaration means, above all, to restate the centrality and intrinsic worth of the human person and to reaffirm the inherent rights shared by all men and women, no matter how young or old, rich or poor, strong or vulnerable, healthy or sick, wanted or undesired, economically productive or incapacitated, politically influential or insignificant. the world, in fact, needs to regain an all-encompassing vision of the human person, human dignity and human rights, since any reductive vision of the human person inevitably dehumanizes and effectively excludes certain persons from membership of the human race, opening the way to inequality, injustice, and injury. the seventieth anniversary of the universal declaration is also a favorable occasion to renew our shared commitment, not just in words but also in practice, to those rights that flow from every person s inherent dignity. the report of the secretary-general on the work of the organization highlights that, although there has been much progress made in the advancement of human rights at a global level... challenges to the protection of human rights are a global phenomenon. 4 while it is heartening to read of positive developments in the area of human rights accomplished in the last seven decades, it is sobering to note that one in ten children is still subjected to child labor, one in three people currently in detention is held without trial, 29 percent of children under five do not have birth registration, and that 250 million were women married when under the age of 15.5 it is scandalous to see that human rights continue to be violated today seven decades after the adoption of the universal declaration. the declaration affirms that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, and yet in many places those rights are not only not respected but their violations are even celebrated. article iv (4) states that “no one shall be held in slavery or servitude,” and yet tens of millions are ensnared by various forms of so-called modem slavery. article xviii (18) upholds the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, to change one’s religion or belief, and the freedom alone or in community with others, in public or private, to manifest that religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. yet these rights are infringed upon, restricted or denied and in so many places changing one’s religion or even practicing one’s faith is still a death sentence or a reason to be discriminated against. 3 cf., paul vi, encyclical populorum progressio john-paul ii, encyclical sollicitudo rei socialis; benedict xvi, encyclical letter caritas in veritate ; francis encyclicals, laudato si and evangelii gaudium. 4 a/73/1, report of the secretary-general on the work of the organization, p. 24. 5 ibid., pp. 26-27. earlier this year, in his address to the diplomatic corps accredited to the holy see, pope francis noted some trends t at, in the very name of the promotion of human rights, are in fact undermini g the enjoyment of those rights enshrined in the universal declaration. he noted that, debatable notions of human rights have been advanced that are at odds with the culture of many countries. 6 he cautioned that this trend portends the risk that, in the very name of human rights, we will see the rise of modem forms of ideological colonization by the stronger and the wealthier, to the detriment of the poorer and the most vulnerable. 7 the seventieth anniversary of the universal declaration affords the inte ational community an occasion to recognize the damage that ideological interpretations or novel rights claims do, in principle and practice, to the human rights and fundamental freedoms actually enshrined in the universal declaration and translated into inte ational law and conventions. the holy see is especially conce ed about the increasingly narrow interpretation of the right to life, both on the national level and at the level of the treaty bodies and other human rights mechanisms. that tendency is particularly apparent within a current of the human rights discourse that refuses to recognize the inherent value and dignity of human life at e ery stage of its beginning, development and end. that approach seeks to create a hierarchy of human rights, by relativizing human dignity, assigning more value and even rights to the strong and healthy, while discarding the weak. that ideology, unfortunately present in various parts of the un human rights system, leads to some grave inequalities and injustices, often ignoring children in the womb and treating the lives of the elderly and persons with disabilities, as expendable or indeed as a burden to society. while freedom is cmcial to the ability of every person to express one s unique identity, the reduction of a person’s dignity to his or her capacity for self-expression and affirmation is always a grave error and a sign that society is losing its ability to recognize the value and importance of every human life, no matter how vulnerable. it is worth recalling here pope francis’ words: a society without proximity, where gratuity and affection without compensation between strangers as well is disappearing, is a perverse society. 8 the same dehumanization occurs when people are reduced to the crimes they may have committed, the country to which they belong or to their productive capacity. the holy see reaffirms that the quality of a civilization, depends also on how it treats the weakest, the indigent, the elderly, the person with disability, and by the place it gives them in community life. 6 pope francis, address to the members of the diplo atic corps accredited to the holy see for the traditional exchange of new ye r s greetings, 8 january 2018. 7 ibid. 8 pope francis, meeting of the pope with the elderly, 28 september 2014. madam president, article xxii of the universal declaration affirms that: everyone ... has the right to social security and... to realization of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality. frequently though, because of war and conflict, poverty, natural disasters and other similar causes, that right cannot be fulfilled in one s place of birth or residence. such situations prompt millions to leave their place of residence in order to fulfill their basic human needs and to search for well-being and happiness for themselves and for their loved ones. this year saw the completion of a long, comprehensive process to address the challenges of international migration. for the first time ever, the international community engaged in an open and transparent debate on the phenomenon of these movements, that generally occur in mixed movements and on what is needed to manage migration in a more safe, orderly and regular manner. the result is the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which will be adopted this coming december at an international conference to be held in marrakesh, morocco. the global compact for migration, together with the global compact on refugees, provide a continuum of protection for all those forced to flee from their place of residence, including those displaced by sudden-onset and slow-onset natural disasters, climate change and environmental degradation, ensuring that no one is left behind. taken together, these compacts affirm our shared responsibility, in the pursuit of the common good, to care for those most in need of solidarity and for those whose dignity and fundamental human rights are most at risk. the strain that many states face in responding to mixed flows, especially when they are unpredictable and overwhelming, was considered thoroughly. not only the need for increased international solidarity and burden and responsibility sharing, but also of the prior commitment of states to work together to create conditions that allow communities and individuals to live in safety and dignity in their own countries 9 became apparent. that includes not only increased investment in education, and basic health care infrastructure and services, but also capacity building and training for the youth, with a view to helping them find their place and affirm their dignity in an increasingly destabilizing global economy. it also requires addressing the root causes and driving factors that displace people before they are constrained to leave their homelands. in order to respect every person’s human dignity, it is indispensable to create the conditions necessary for the realization of the right to remain. those conditions include the protection of the family as 9 a/conf.231/3, annex, paragraph 13. the basic unit of society. when individuals are forced to leave their families behind, often in search of a better life for their children and loved ones, the very fabric of society begins to unravel. there is no substitute for family unity, which must be upheld both for those who remain, as well as for those on the move. pope francis described these shared responsibilities and authentic solidarity in four verbs: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate. the holy see hopes that the honest effort expended on the global compacts will endure, in line with these four steps, to respect migrants and refugees’ rights and dignity in a spirit of international solidarity while recognizing the sovereign right of states to determine their national migration policy in light of their obligations under inte ational law. in a recent encounter with migrants, pope francis said, before the challenges of contemporary movements of migration, the only reasonable response is one of solidarity and mercy. ... a just policy is one at the service of the person, of every person involved; a policy that provides for solutions that can ensure security [and] respect for the rights and dignity of all; a policy concerned for the good of one’s own country, while taking into account that of others in an ever more interconnected world. 10 the holy see hopes that the global compacts will serve as useful tools for good migration management at every level and a common resource for achieving our shared responsibility in front of the plight of refugees, as well as reference points for international cooperation in the management of migration and the care for refugees. madam president, the universal declaration reminds us that the defense of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of peace in the world. article 1 affirms that we are “endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. wars and armed conflicts are therefore not only violations of reason, conscience and fraternity, but they cause the worst violations of human dignity and of basic human rights. in the middle east, the multifaceted political and diplomatic pressures and violence, together with the various humanitarian situations, especially in syria, must be adequately and urgently addressed by the international community. furthermore, all interested parties must also demonstrate a unified will to strive for an end to violence and reach “a solution which can enable palestinians and israelis alike to live at last in peace within clearly 10 pope francis, homily during the celebration of mass for migrants, 6 july 2018. pagei6 established and inte ationally recognized borders, thus implementing the two state solution .11 the holy see remains concerned about the ongoing political tensions and instability in nicaragua and venezuela, especially with regard to the humanitarian crisis in the latter. there is a need to promote a genuine public awareness of certain ongoing situations of conflict with a view to reaching a negotiated and peaceful solution, especially in ukraine, libya and the central african republic, among others. the holy see considers the recent political developments in south sudan and the democratic republic of the congo, as well as between ethiopia and eritrea, as positive signs toward building peaceful and democratic societies based on the firm hope that agreements reached will be mutually respected. war and armed conflict can only be prevented by promoting and protecting the dignity of every human life and by fostering a culture of peace animated by sincere mutual respect, dialog and solidarity. the tragedy of the first world war, whose end a hundred years ago we will mark in november, teaches us that victory must not mean humiliating a defeated foe, and that peace can only be achieved when nations can discuss matters on equal terms.12 a culture of peace implies fighting injustice and rooting out, in a nonviolent way, the causes of discord that lead to wars. the pursuit of peace requires renouncing violence to vindicate one’s rights, since countering violence with violence leads to more death and destruction, deeper resentment and hatred lasting for decades, atrocities and forced mass migrations and the diversion of vast amounts of resources from development to military ends. fostering a culture of peace likewise entails intensifying our efforts toward disarmament and disowning the use of force in the conduct of international affairs. every effort in this direction, however modest, helps to build a culture of peace. the holy see underlines the deep bonds between the promotion of the culture of peace and the strengthening of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. the proliferation of weapons in fact aggravates conflicts and generates vast human and material costs hindering human and economic development and the search for lasting peace. as the secretary-general’s report emphasizes, we need to reinvigorate disarmament because it is pivotal to preserving human security through the prevention of conflict and the reduction of violence,... [to] saving lives and ensuring a safer world. 13 in this perspective, the holy see is firmly committed to the full implementation of the disarmament and non¬ proliferation treaties and program of actions in the nuclear, chemical and biological 11 pope francis, address to the members of the diplomatic corps accredited to the holy see, 12 january 2015. 12 pope francis, address to the members of the diplomatic corps accredited to the holy see for the traditional exchange of new year s greetings, 8 january 2018. 13 a/73/1, report of the secretary-general on the work of the organization, p. 6. weapons fields, as well as those relating to cluster munition, antipersonnel mines and small arms and light weapons. the responsibility to defend human dignity and rights is particularly acute in situations when people fall victim to genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crime against humanity. today, where so many national and regional conflicts amount to what pope francis has called a third [world] war... fought piecemeal, 14 the need to protect populations is more urgent than ever. it is worthwhile to recall that, although the responsibility to protect was defined only at the 2005 world summit, it has always been at the root of the united nations. already in the early part of the sixteenth century, when the concept of national sovereign states was emerging, the spanish friar francisco de vitoria described the responsibility of governors to protect their citizens as an aspect of natural reason shared by all nations and a rule for an international” order whose task is to regulate relations between peoples. the principles that de vitoria first articulated in the sixteenth century have been enshrined in the 2005 world summit outcome.15 the holy see upholds the perennial validity of the responsibility to protect and calls for its full, impartial and consistent implementation. such an implementation necessarily entails fulfilling all obligations under international human rights and international humanitarian law obligations, as well as condemning any deliberate attacks against civilian targets. it means preventing or stopping crimes against humanity and protecting populations from them through greater legal, political and moral accountability. peace requires forgiveness. forgiveness is central to reconciliation and peacebuilding, since it makes possible the healing and rebuilding of human relations. forgiveness is not opposed to justice but it is rather its fulfillment, since it leads to the healing of the wounds that fester in human hearts while acknowledging the evil that has been committed. a culture of peace involves therefore the courageous choice of not allowing the wounds of the past to bleed into the present so that we can walk together towards reconciliation. every religion is called to assist in the reconciliation ef ort by promoting peace. equally important is the testimony given when different religions come together to pray and work for peace. interreligious and intercultural dialog provides the world with a paradigm to share their respective cultural patrimony, grow in mutual appreciation of the others perspectives, heal past wounds, and journey together toward peace and human development. religious men and women, moved as they are to revere each other’s god- 14 pope francis, homily at the military memorial in redipuglia, 13 september 2014. 15 united nations, 2005 world summit outcome, paragraphs 138 and 139. given dignity, have a special responsibility to bear witness by respectful and constructive dialog among cultures. although, even today, there are (some) acts of religiously motivated violence, the response cannot be a renewed form of retaliatory justice, but authentic dialog between the various religious communities on the basis of the joint and unequivocal belief that killing others in the name of god offends god himself. terrorism is not an outgrowth of religion properly understood, but rather the fruit of a profound spiritual poverty. defeating it requires the joint contribution of all religious and political leaders. religious leaders must therefore promote those values that foster the love of one s neighbor. on their part, political leaders must guarantee the enjoyment of the right to religious freedom, while acknowledging religion’s positive contribution to the building of a civil society that sees no opposition between the participation in the political community and the spiritual dimension of life. they must also ensure that there are no conditions - such as poverty, insufficient support for families, and inadequate investment in education and culture - that favor the spread of fundamentalism. the holy see wishes to reaffirm its heartfelt conce for all victims of terrorism, at the same time, it wishes to underline that all measures to combat terrorist activities must fully respect human rights. in particular, counter-terrorism measures should not hinder the legitimate work of charitable organizations, including those motivated by faith, in caring for vulnerable populations. it must be recognized that humanitarian assistance in underdeveloped countries and in crisis zones contributes positively to the prevention of terrorism and retaliatory violence and that, therefore, it fosters the enjoyment of human rights and the respect for dignity. as noted in the secretary general report, terrorism is a worldwide scourge and requires a globally coordinated response. 16 the holy see welcomes all efforts to enhance multilateral cooperation against terrorism, such as the recent united nations high-level conference of heads of counter-terrorism agencies. madam president, the universal declaration affirms the equal rights of men and women 17 as flowing from their inherent dignity and worth. it is therefore necessary to adopt all measures to promote equality in rights and full and equal participation of women and men in society. 16 a/73/1, report of the secretary-general on the work of the organization, p. 7. 17 preamble of the universal declaration of human rights. while history books sing the victories of emperors and warriors, all of civilization owes an unpayable debt of gratitude to the less chronicled or even unknown contributions of women and men that have shaped civilizations. while textbooks normally obsess about the names at the top of political hierarchies and are preoccupied fundamentally with economic and military trends, it is worth recalling that genuine human progress happens more fundamentally in the relations human beings have with one another and the way human beings care for one another. today, women and men are at the forefront of the revolution of tenderness 18 that pope francis has insisted the world urgently needs. in response to various forms of human suffering and to material, emotional or even spiritual necessities, people need help and remedies that accord with the fullness of their human dignity. having gone through multiple traumas, they need to be cared for and treated with great sensitivity and attention. beyond their professional competence and technical knowledge, women have, indeed, shown a special capacity for recognizing, affirming, nurturing and defending the inherent dignity of others, and to contribute greatly in the efforts to promote a peaceful, respectful and harmonious world. as pope francis affirms it: women look at life through their own eyes and men are not able to look at life in this way. the way of viewing a problem, of seeing anything, is different for a woman compared to a man. they must be comp lementary. 19 the true progress in humanity that is dramatically needed in our challenged world, will also depend on the full participation of women on an equal and same footing with men, in the civil, political, social, economic or cultural fields. we note with great concern that women s indispensable role is often undervalued and can even be a vehicle for the exploitation and violation of their dignity and fundamental rights. still today, women face a variety of challenges and difficulties in various parts of the world. they experience discri ination in the workplace; they are often forced to choose between work and family; they disproportionately suffer in conflict situations. in poor and developing countries, women bear the heaviest burdens: it is they who travel many miles in search of water, who too often do not have access even to the most basic medical assistance that they need in childbirth, who are kidnapped for sexual exploitation or forced into marriage. at times, they are even denied the right to life sim ly for being female. the authentic advancement of women entails, rather, absolute respect for their inherent dignity, while acknowledging their critical roles not only in the various spheres of 18 pope francis, video message on the occasion of the ted conference in vancouver, 26 april 2017. 19 pope francis, address to the international union of superiors general, 12 may 2016. pa ge j10 society, but also in the family, as equal participants in marriage as spouses. it is therefore contradictory to seek to promote women's empowerment while suppressing their unique natural potentialities in the name of some particular interests or those of an ideological agenda. it is also incoherent when women's irreplaceable contribution to society through motherhood is stigmatized as an obstacle to their advancement and empowerment, instead of being acknowledged, supported and accompanied with measures aimed at alleviating the difficulties that they may encounter. the holy see wishes to avail itself of this occasion to express grateful appreciation for all those women who, sometimes heroically, have raised and educated generations of responsible daughters and sons. the world owes them gratitude and esteem, support and solidarity. the universal declaration understands human dignity as the dignity of the person within society, since the person is always in relation to others. in article xvi (16.3) it stresses that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state. 20 in article xxv (25.2) it affirms that “motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance, 21 and in article xxvi (26.3) it underlines that “parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.”22 these principles have perennial validity even in the midst of changing societies and must be upheld for the good of every child, every family and every society. as pope francis reminds us: “the strength of the family lies in its capacity to love and to teach how to love.”23 “the family is a school of humanity, a school which teaches us to open our hearts to others needs, to be attentive to their lives .24 as such, it remains a model, as well as a reference for the promotion of harmony within society and among the “family of nations”. the family is the greatest treasure for a country and for future generations. in particular, it is urgent to promote the protection of children today, as children are regularly victims of armed conflict, violence, various forms of exploitation and abuse, and are exposed to hunger and extreme poverty. the way we care for every child shows the depth of our humanity and of our appreciation for the dignity and rights of every person. for its part, the catholic church, at all levels, is committed not only to promoting the protection of children, but also to creating safe environments for them in its own 20 universal declaration of human rights, art. 16 (3). 21 ibid., art. 25 (2). 22 ibid., art. 26 (3). 23 pope francis, apostolic exhortation, amoris laetitia, 19 march 2016, n.53 24 pope francis, meeting with families, santiago (cuba), 22 september 2015. p a g e | 11 institutions, in order to address the heinous scourge of sexual abuse and violence against children.25 madam president, when the universal declaration speaks about development, it always does so with regard to the free and full development of the human person. 26 for the holy see, development must always be “integral,” which, in the words of pope paul vi, means that it “cannot be restricted to economic growth alone. authentic development must be well rounded; it must foster the development of each [person] and of the whole [person].”27 respect for human rights and human dignity, based on a profound appreciation of the whole person and every person is essential to eradicate extreme poverty and to promote integral human development. without paying attention to these fundamental anthropological coordinates, the sustainable development agenda would be reduced to its economic, environmental, or sociological elements. extreme poverty is more than a socio-economic problem; it is also an ethical one, flowing from a globalization of indifference exacerbated by consumerism. the alternative to that individualistic, indifferent and self-centered approach is an interpersonal one that involves personal, social, economic and environmental advancement and solidarity. this principle of interconnectedness is found in the addis ababa action agenda on financing for development, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the paris agreement on climate change. in adopting those documents, we committed ourselves to promote integral and authentic development in harmony with nature. we should put all our efforts into achieving the sdgs and the demanding goals of the paris agreement. the holy see hopes that the cop-24, to be held in katowice this december, will represent a strong step in this direction through a good and effective advancement on the paris agreement work program. the report of the secretary general describes some of the recent progress made in the area of integral development across the world. the mortality rate of children under five has dropped by 47 percent in the last ten years. the proportion of the population of least developed countries with access to electricity has more than doubled since 2000. unemployment has decreased in many countries as various institutions and frameworks necessary for the implementation of the 2030 agenda have been put into place. the report stresses, however, that progress has been uneven and too slow to meet the ambitious goals 25 cf., pope francis, address to the members of the pontific l commission for the protection of minors, 21 september 2017. 26 universal declaration of human rights, article 29.1. see also articles 22 and 26.2. 27 pope paul vi, encyclical letter populorum progressio, 14. pa g e i 12 of the agenda. by 2015, thirty percent of people worldwide still did not have access to safe drinking water, while sixty percent did not have access to adequate sanitation. after a prolonged decline, world hunger has been rising again. the recent 2018 high level political forum showed that there is an urgent need to step up efforts with regard to energy, water and ecosystems. moreover, the recent rise in trade tensions and a growing skepticism of multilateralism endanger the coordinated global effort to sustainable development for all. madam president, the centrality of the human person must also be reaffirmed in the context of the current environmental crisis. as pope francis has reminded us, we are not faced with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather one complex crisis that is both social and environmental. 28 this complex reality involves not only our common home but also our partners on this planet and therefore demands an integrated ethical approach that simultaneously cares for the environment while it combats poverty and exclusion, assures the collective enjoyment of the common good, and fosters intergenerational solidarity. such an approach requires taking with the utmost seriousness our responsibility to care for these precious natural resources and to protect those persons, especially the poorest, who depend on them for their daily subsistence. i am thinking above all of the issues related to food security and food safety, as well as access to clean water and the management of the oceans. without an approach informed by ethical considerations, we are left with an economic system where financial gain and political power are placed above the good of the environment and those most vulnerable.29 an ethical approach to the current crisis must also inspire solidarity with future generations. as pope francis reminds us, “intergenerational solidarity is not optional, but rather a basic question of justice, since the world we have received also belongs to those who will follow us.”30 while care for our common home benefits us, it is also a gift to future generations, sparing them from paying the price of environmental deterioration and ensuring that they are able to enjoy its beauty, wonder, and manifold endowment. i thank you, madam president. 28 pope francis, encyclical letter laudato si ,139. 29 ibid, 198. 30 ibid, 159.","archbishop paul richard gallagher, secretary of relations with states for the holy see, noted that despite positive developments in human rights, 1 in 10 children still suffer child labor, 1 in 3 people currently in detention are held without trial, 29 per cent of children under age 5 have no birth registration and 250 million women are married before the age of 15. tens of millions of others are ensnared in forms of modern slavery. it is scandalous to see human rights still violated seven decades after adoption of the universal declaration of human rights, he stated. it is especially concerning that a current within human rights discourse refuses to recognize the inherent value and dignity of human life at every stage of its beginning, development and end. turning to global flashpoints, he urged the international community to address the situation in syria. calling for a two‑state solution so palestinians and israelis can live in peace within internationally recognized borders, he said the holy see is also concerned by the instability in nicaragua and venezuela, and the conflicts in ukraine, libya and the central african republic. however, recent developments in south sudan and the democratic republic of the congo, as well as between ethiopia and eritrea are positive signs towards building peaceful, democratic societies. “peace requires forgiveness,” he said. terrorism is not an outgrowth of religion properly understood, but of spiritual poverty, as “killing others in the name of god offends god himself”. affirming the equal rights of men and women, he noted that pope francis insists the world urgently needs a revolution of tenderness. women have shown a special capacity for recognizing, affirming, nurturing and defending the inherent dignity of others. yet, women’s indispensable role is often undervalued and that, in poor and developing countries, they lack access to basic medical assistance in childbirth, suffer sexual exploitation and forced marriage. stating that the family is the greatest treasure for a country and future generations, the catholic church is committed not only to promoting the protection of children but to creating safe environments for them in its own institutions to address “the heinous scourge of sexual abuse and violence” against them."
Honduras,,"juan orlando hernández alvarado (honduras) said his country’s congress voted on 25 september to appoint a commission to modernize the national election system with a view to creating new transparent technology. he expressed frustration that sometimes there can be a lack of determination and courage to translate myriad global ideas into simple action on the ground. “if we want to live in a harmonious system, then we must uphold the pillars of this organization,” he said, warning of constant international forces that want to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign states. “it is necessary to protect rule of law in our countries,” he stressed. “the world is clamoring for great reforms and deep-seated transformation … and it is up to this generation of leaders to meet the many demands,” he continued. despite being very vulnerable to climate change, honduras has taken steps to combat the scourge. excessive bureaucracy has impeded funding, however, he added, emphasizing that it is up to the organization to discuss and decide how those funds be used. “every minute those funds stay in the bank vaults is another minute that banks get rich and people suffer,” he said. honduras and the wider central america region have for years been the epicenter of a migrant crisis. millions of migrants are treated as subhuman. “they receive ill treatment as they tackle the route of terror towards the united states,” he said. they fall victim to human and drug traffickers and gangs. honduras still awaits the family reunification of 129 children who have been separated from their parents. nations of the general assembly can never forget their commitment to human rights, he said, urging the senior officials of the united nations and member states to do more to protect the rights of children. the goal of honduras and its neighboring countries is to lay the foundation of a central american customs union, he said. such a model will facilitate trade based on justice and equality. he expressed concern for the unfairness with which coffee producers have been treated. he asked: “how many of you drink a cup of coffee in the morning or during the day?” there is a great probability that you are participating in an enormous injustice causing extreme poverty. a cup of coffee in new york costs about $5 and yet a coffee producer in honduras doesn’t even get two cents from that. “is that an injustice or not?” in honduras alone, there are 90,000 coffee producers. “let us organize ourselves because apparently no one is looking out for the interests of small coffee producers,” he said. in honduras, there are also non-state armed groups confronting good citizens and the government, he continued, adding that armed groups are constantly trying to undermine the rule of law. they violate the rights of thousands of hondurans. the situation in honduras should sound the alarm for member states to unite to defend the rule of law. “what this is about is the fundamental right to life, freedom and democracy,” he continued, requesting the assembly to produce a resolution to recognize gangs as non-state actors that cause instability and undermine the rule of law. honduras is working to create a climate of peace, but that is just not enough. he called on the conscience of all world leaders to protect democracies and human rights from non-state armed groups and gangs."
Hungary,,"péter szijjártó, minister for foreign affairs and trade of hungary, pointed to migration as the greatest challenge in history. migratory waves are imposing huge security risks globally, destabilizing countries, causing political debates globally and bringing terrorism to a region where it did not exist before, he said. migration is not beneficial for everyone, especially not for those countries hosting a large number of migrants coming from different cultures, he added. arguing that it leads to the creation of a parallel society, he recalled the 400,000 illegal migrants marching through hungary in 2015, violating borders, disrespecting his people’s way of life and threatening individuals and families. he stated that hungary experienced illegal migration first‑hand, deploring the fact that the european union failed while looking for an answer to this challenge. he argued that the union looked at how to encourage the migratory flow and not how to stop it. while the union wants to introduce obligatory quotas for migrants to be taken in by its member states, he said that the bloc intends to punish unwilling countries. the union’s institutions kept saying that stopping migration is not possible. however, hungary proved them otherwise, he said, adding that his nation spent more than €1 billion to build a fence along its borders. policies encouraging migratory waves are harmful and must be stopped, he said. “migration is not a fundamental human right,” he underlined, noting that violating international and national borders is also not a right. officials of the united nations tend to speak of migration as a means to improving prosperity and global innovation, he noted, recalling that this is a forced and biased position, warning that the global compact for migration is the worst possible thing to do. referring to the united states leaving the process, he stressed that “we will also leave the process as we do not accept the global compact on [for] migration and we will not take part in the mechanism,” he declared, adding that the compact is strongly biased and unbalanced. he noted that it is dangerous, causing further migratory waves. the sovereignty of countries must be respected, he emphasized, noting that the international community must respect the rights of countries to permit whom they wish to enter. all nations have the right to decide with whom they want to live, he underlined, while safeguarding their historical and cultural heritage. labor markets, economic and social policies, and demographic trends should be defined and controlled by countries themselves. border protection measures should not be based on human rights, he said, noting that it is a national security issue. it is an obligation of each country, he said, recalling that nations have the right and responsibility to control their own borders. he stressed that illegal border crossing is a serious criminal offense which must be made clear, emphasizing that violating such regulations must result in serious consequences. according to the compact, a multicultural society is more valuable than a homogeneous one, he said. contradicting this, he said nations must be able to decide that themselves, declaring that hungary does not believe it. deploring that the compact only states migrants’ rights, but not the rights of the peoples affected, he noted that hungary establishes its migration policies on common sense, putting security first as it does not want a repeat of its experience from 2015. modernizing the education system and raising more children will help to address demographic challenges, he said. he urged the international community not to encourage migratory flows. instead of people risking their life and leaving their homes, we should bring aid to them, he said, pointing to hungary assisting christian people in the region and helping them to stay where they have lived for ages. lastly, he warned that hungary will not approve the global compact for migration as it stands against national interests, declaring that his nation will always stick up for its rights."
Iceland,"the permanent mission of iceland to the united nations 73 united nations general assembly statement by icel nd h.e. gudlaugur thor thordarsson minister for foreign affairs of iceland new

president, the united nations has played a critical role in promoting peace and development for all. most indices, measuring human development tell a positive story - a story of our shared success. it is a story we should tell more often. technological advances and social and economic progress, we never envisioned, ha e become a reality. this gives us hope that mankind can once again prove that no challenge is too big to overcome - that we are right to dream big. but dreams will only come true with hard work and determination. and our common goals will only be achieved through inte ational co-operation and by accelerating the pace of progress significantly. the united nations is the most important platform we have for this vital co¬ operation. iceland is a small country7 with high ambitions. a gender equal world is one of those. we have a solid record as one of the most gender equal countries in the world. this only happened through the hard work of women pioneers who changed our politics and our law to empower all women in iceland. in good cooperation with a few good men, of course. more needs to be done at home, but we stand ready to share our experience with other states. gender equality is a master-key to unlocking sustainable development in all countries in line with the goals of agenda 2030. another goal of ours, is to make sure that future generations will than us, you and me, for having worked hard to save them from the worst consequences of climate change. in the arctic, iceland sits in the front row witnessing disappearing ice-caps and changing ecolog 7. in the drier parts of the globe, desertification continues and causes serious challenges for people's livelihoods. there is no doubt in my mind that climate change is fast becoming the single most serious challenge to glo bal peace, security7 and development. while technology will be a big part of the solution with electric cars and renewable energy fuelling our economies, we will also need to nurture our soil and restore our land in fighting climate change. this is reflected m the ambitious new climate strategy of the government of iceland, put in place to meet our paris agreement targets for 2030 and make iceland carbon neutral by 2040. already, all electricity and heating in iceland is produced from renewable resources. our plan aims to phase out fossil fuels in transport and increase afforestation and restoration of wetlands. we join a coalition of other countries that have already put such plans in place because, again, the only way forward is through co-operation. high-income countries must do their share to reduce emissions and help lo ancome countries adapt to the effects of climate change. in the end, our reaction to climate change has more to do ith self-preservation than self-sacrifice. sustainable development, ith particular emphasis on the oceans, climate and energ , and soc al and economic development ill be among the guiding principles of iceland s chairmanship of the arctic council from 2019 to 2021. the council has sho n remarkable leadership in promoting sustainable development and practical co-operation in the high north and could be used as a model for other regions of the world, as local actions can drive global change. madame president, iceland is firmly committed to agenda 2030, ith its inclusive and bottom-up approach to development. it is a key policy priority for our government with a strong ownership and participation of both the private sector and civil society. we look forward to the upcoming iceland’s voluntary7 national review in 2019 and are hoping for a constructive feedback encouraging us to do better. healthy oceans and sustainable fisheries ill remain at the core of iceland s foreign policy. to reach our goal on healthy oceans, all nations must join hands. the convention on the law of sea and its implementing agreements provide a tried and tested framework for the work ahead. through our experience, we have learned that the most effective approach to conservation and sustainable use of marine resources is the regional approach. this should also be the main approach in the new bbnj-implementing agreement, currently bein negotiated. in the field of marine resource management, we stand ready to share our expertise with others. the same a plies to gender equalit green energy and land restoration, all of which are a part of the un training programs in iceland. almost 5.000 experts from 100 countries have been trained since the first program was established almost forty years ago. this has been made possible because this knowledge was fostered by icelandic institutions and private companies, not least within the fisher ' and energy' sectors. development, trade and business can and should go hand in glove in implementing agenda 2030, and we are pleased to note that the un is taking concrete steps in making such partnerships stronger, bringing energy, innovation and know-how into national and global efforts. in the past few decades we have also seen incredible advances in medicine. these advances have enabled us to live longer despite increasingly unhealthy lifestyles. yesterday, we vowed to actively co-operate for the pre ention of non-communicable deceases and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. one neglected issue is neurolo ical disorders that affect a billion people worldwide. the nordic countries are working towards a common research database on neurological disorders to facilitate medical advances in this area. we encourage others to do the same as, yet again, co¬ operation will be key to success. madame president, earlier this year, iceland took a seat on the human rights council for the first time. it ivas a proud moment for us, joining the council at a time when iceland celebrates our nation's 100 years of sovereignty and the 70 years anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights. we believe that human rights express the core purpose of the united nations. advancing the dignity and equality' of all human beings must be our fundamental goal. only that way can we attain peace, security and sustainable development for all societies. we firmly believe that upholding human rights is in the interest of every state. the human rights council should be the standard bearer for respecting, protecting and promoting human rights around the globe. its member states must be willing to improve human rights in their ow backyard - so our criticism does not fall on de f ears. we will strive for improving the human rights council through dialog and co-operation. our priorities also revolve around promoting women s human rights and safeguarding our children’s rights and freedom from violence. we will work to advance the human rights of lgbti individuals and, lastly, focus on the connection between climate change and human rights. iceland’s history underlines that the prosperity and well-being of nations is, to a large extent, dependent upon protecting and promoting the rights of our citizens - including civil, political, economic and cultural rights. as a part of our commitment to human rights, iceland’s ne r de elopment cooperation strategy will incorporate a human rights-based approach. this means that further steps will now be ta en to ensure that our development strategies and projects are formulated, implemented and evaluated with human rights at the forefront. madame president, it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. the united nations is the heart of international co-operation but, to reach our common goals, more efficient and effective united nations is what is called for. iceland strongly supports the reform agenda of the secretar ' general, making our organization, which was built in a different era, fit to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century..we s ould continue to seek ways to reform the security council, its working methods and membership. it should not be held hostage by narrow national interests when our house is on fire. we need to show more unity. despite the progress we have made in even' field, there are still di ficult conflicts to be resolved. even today, in the year of 2018, we are itnessing the use of chemical weapons, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, forced migration and other horrors, which should be echoes from a distant past - not everyday news. the syrian war has left the country in ruins, over 400.000 people dead and almost half the population displaced. a political solution continues to be the only viable path towards winning the peace. in yemen we are witnessing a conflict that is fast becoming the worst humanitarian crisis in the world a d there seems to be no end in sight as regional powerhouses continue to fuel the fires of war. the issue of western sahara remains unresolved and the same applies to the israeli-palestinian conflict. the disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine and georgia remain a wound in the european securit 7 architecture. we witness the mounting challenges in venezuela and continue to receive reports on horrors committed against the rohingya population in myanmar. we must act and make full use of the tools available to hold those responsible to account, including before the inte ational criminal court. all these conflicts become even more disconcerting when we consider that almost 250 million children are being affected - casting a long shadow into their future. these conflict-stricken areas and other emergencies are also driving the greatest refugee crisis since the end of the second world war and call for a co-ordinated response, which we hope the global compact for refugees will be able to deliver. madame president, the multilateral system, the very foundation of prosperity and peace, is under strain from new and challenging political agendas where simple answers are provided to complex questions - favoring strongman politics over diplomacy, free trade, democracy and hu an rights. we need to stand by our convictions and principles, both at home and abroad, while addressing some of the le itimate grievances of our citizens. iceland has been increasing its contributions to un programs and funds. we will continue to support the united nations and stand by its founding values and principles. madame president, december 1st 2018 marks the centenary of iceland s independence and sovereignty. this period has been characterized by rapid economic growth and social development - giving birth to a society that scores high on almost all development indices. one could be tempted to say that this success was all our own making nd fortune, but that would be far from the truth. the bedrock of our independence and success has been the international rule-based order with its open market, free-trade, multilateral institutions, liberal democracy and inte ational co-operation. this foundation should never be taken for granted and it falls on us, the member states of the united nations, to make sure the future generations can enjoy the same benefits. thank you, madame president.","gudlaugur thór thórdarson, minister for foreign affairs of iceland, saying that gender equality is a “master key” to unlocking sustainable development in all countries in line with 2030 agenda, noted that his nation is one of the most gender equal countries in the world. addressing climate change, he noted: “in the arctic, iceland sits in the front row witnessing disappearing ice caps and changing ecology.” saying the issue is fast becoming the most serious challenge to global peace, security and development, he highlighted the new government of iceland climate strategy, aiming to make the country carbon neutral by 2040. already, all electricity and heating are produced from renewable resources, and the plan aims to phase out fossil fuels and increase afforestation and restoration of wetlands. stating iceland is firmly committed to the 2030 agenda and its “inclusive and bottom-up approach to development”, he cited a national foreign policy with healthy oceans and sustainable fisheries at its core. the united nations convention on the law of the sea provides a tried and tested framework, with iceland’s own experience showing the regional approach to conservation is most effective. he stated that iceland has developed and is ready to share expertise in marine resource management, having trained almost 5,000 experts from 100 countries in a program that also embraces gender equality, green energy and land restoration. in medicine, he highlighted the neglected issue of neurological disorders, affecting 1 billion people worldwide. the nordic countries are working towards a common research database on neurological disorders. expressing pride that iceland in 2018 took a seat on the human rights council, a first for his country, while celebrating the country’s centenary of sovereignty, he stated that upholding human rights is in the interest of every state. iceland’s priorities are promoting the rights of women, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, and the connection between climate change and human rights. he noted that iceland’s history underlines that a nation’s prosperity and well-being is largely dependent on protecting and promoting citizens’ rights. saying the security council should be reformed and not held hostage by narrow national interests, he pointed to difficult and unresolved global conflicts. stating the syrian war has left the country in ruins with more than 400,000 dead and almost half the population displaced, he said a political solution is required. the yemen situation is fast becoming the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. the issue of western sahara is unresolved, as is the israeli-palestinian conflict, and he described the disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine and georgia “a wound in the european security architecture”. referring to horrors committed against the rohingya population of myanmar, he called for those responsible to be held to account, including before the international criminal court. these conflicts become even more disconcerting when considering that almost 250 million children are affected, and along with the correlative refugee crisis, the greatest since the second world war, call for a coordinated response."
India,"indu general debate of the 73""^^ united nations general assembly statement by minister of external affairs smt. sushma swaraj 29 september 2018 permanent mission of india to the united nations 235 east 43rd street, new york, ny 10017 • tel: (212) 490-9660 • fax: (212) 490-9656 e-mail: india@un.int your excellency madam president, may i begin by congratulating you on your election as the president of the 73^^ session of the united nations general assembly, on my personal behalf as well as on behalf of my country, india. as a woman, i feel doubly proud that you have this honor. i also recall, with equal pride, that the first woman to occupy this eminent chair was an indian smt. vijayalakshmi pandit, in 1953 during the 8^^ session. i will also like to thank the outgoing president mr. miroslav lajcak for successfully conducting the 72""^ session of the united nations general assembly. madam president, the united organization: nations is the world's premier multilateral 1: where nations seek balm for the wounds of history, and a platform for solutions. 2: where less developed nations sit with their more fortunate brethren to formulate plans that can correct the skewered economic imbalance. 3: where new goals are set, and route maps defined, to make our world a better place. in 2015, we established 2030 as a critically important horizon for 17 sustainable development goads. a common refrain, from 2015, has been that we will reach that horizon only if india finds its way to this destination. otherwise, we shall fail. i assure this august gathering through you. madam, that india will not let you fail. we are totally committed to achieving these objectives for our own people. under the leadership of prime minister narendra modi, india has initiated unprecedented economic and social transformation that will help india achieve its sdg goals much before time. let me offer a few glimpses of evidence to illustrate what is the world's biggest exercise in poverty elimination and social transformation: through the jan dhan yojana, world's largest financial inclusion scheme, over 320 million indians, who had never crossed the door of a bank before, now have bank accounts. this has enabled the poor to receive allotments from the government's welfare programs into their personal accounts, through direct benefit transfer, which has ended waste and corruption in the system. similarly, a3rushman bharat, the world's biggest health insurance program, was launched by prime minister modi a few days ago on 23rd september. this revolutionary scheme will benefit 500 million indians, who will get an insurance cover of rs 500,000 per family per year. we have a prayer in india: sarve santu niramaya, which means, all should be healthy. the aayushman bharat yojana is the answer to this prayer. similarly, we have launched the largest housing scheme in the world aimed at ensuring that everyone has a roof above their heads. under the scheme, we have set ourselves a target of nearly 21 million homes by 2022. so far, over five million homes for the poor have already been constructed. similarly, two extremely effective schemes have been initiated to raise the skill levels of those waiting to be employed through skill development program and to turn the poor into entrepreneurs, through the mudra program. i want to stress that over 140 million indians have taken mudra loans. the most significant aspect of mudra scheme is that 76% of the beneficiaries are women. at the heart of prime minister modi's transformative vision is a radical idea: that the uplift of any nation is best achieved through the all-round empowerment of women. all the schemes that i have just spoken about have the welfare of women at their core. last yeeir, i spoke about the ujjawala scheme, in which i am happy to report 50 million free gas connections have been provided so far. another such initiative is the maternity benefit scheme, in which women get 26 weeks of paid leave to care for their newborn. madame president, as a woman, you will understand better than most how vitally important this program is for every mother. some developed nations with huge economies do not offer more than six weeks paid leave, leading to a continuing struggle for more time off. in india, we have implemented what women across the world need. madam president, in 2022, free india will be 75 years old. prime minister narendra modi has pledged to build a new india by then. this new india will be: 1: swachh bharat, swasth bharat (clean india, healthy india); 2: samarth bharat, surakshit bharat (prosperous india, secure india); 3: shikshit bharat, viksit bharat (educated india, developed india); 4: urjawan bharat, shaktiman bharat (energized india, strong india). that is our horizon for india in 2022. we will reach that horizon. madam president, the biggest challenge of our era comes from the existential threats of climate change and terrorism. under-developed and developing nations are the worst victim of climate change. they have neither the capacity nor the resources to meet this crisis. those who have exploited nature for their immediate needs cannot abdicate their responsibilities. if we have to save the world from the adverse effects of climate change, then developed nations must lift the deprived with financial and technical resources. the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities was reiterated in the 2015 paris agreement. india has risen to meet the challenge of climate change. prime minister modi in partnership with france launched the international solar alliance. the united nations has recognized their contributions and conferred on prime minister modi and president macron the honor of un champions of the earth. 1 am happy to inform you that 68 nations are now members of isa. in march this year, india and france chaired the founding conference of isa in which 120 countries participated. our prime minister has described his vision of sustainable and available energy in a typically apt phrase: one sun, one grid. this breakthrough concept can become the solution we seek to the problems. madam president, i had described terrorism as the second existential threat to humanity. we imagined that the arrival of the 21st century would bring with it an age of common good, defined by cooperation in the quest for peace and prosperity. but here in new york, the horrific tragedy of 9/11, and in mumbai the catastrophe of 26 /11 became the nightmares that shattered our dreams. the demon of terrorism now stalks the world, at a faster pace somewhere, a slower pace elsewhere, but lifethreatening everywhere. in our case, terrorism is bred not in some faraway land, but across our border to the west. our neighbor's expertise is not restricted to spawning grounds for terrorism; it is also an expert in trying to mask malevolence with verbal duplicity. the most stairtling evidence of this duplicity was the fact that osama bin laden, the architect and ideologue of 9/11 was given safe haven in pakistan. america had declared osama bin laden it's most dangerous enemy, and launched an exhaustive, worldwide search to bring him to justice. what america perhaps could not comprehend was that osama would get sanctuary in a country that claimed to be america's friend and ally: pakistan. eventually, america's intelligence services discovered the truth of this hypocrisy, and its special forces delivered justice. but pakistan continued to behave as if nothing had happened. pakistan's commitment to terrorism as an instrument of official policy has not abated one bit. neither has its belief in hypocrisy. the killers of 9/11 met their fate; but the mastermind of 26/11 haiiz saeed still roams the streets of pakistan with impunity. what is heartening is that the world is no longer ready to believe islamabad. fatf, for instance, has put pakistan on notice over terror funding. madam president, we are accused of sabotaging the process of talks. this is a complete lie. we believe that talks are the only rational means to resolve the most complex of disputes. talks with pakistan have begun many times. if they stopped, it was only because of paikistan's behavior. there have been many governments in india, by many different parties. each government has tried the peace option. prime minister modi, by inviting the heads of the saarc nations, to his swearing in ceremony, began his attempt for dialog on his very first day in office. on 9^^ december 2016, i personally went to islamabad and offered a comprehensive bilateral dialog. but soon after, pak sponsored terrorists attacked our air force base in pathankot on 2""<^ january. please explain to me how we could pursue talks in the midst of terrorist bloodshed? even now, after the new government came to power, the prime minister of pakistan imran khan wrote to prime minister modi suggesting a meeting between foreign ministers in new york. we accepted the proposal. but, within hours of our acceptance, news came that terrorists had killed three of our jawans. does this indicate a desire for dialog? time and again, pakistan accuses india of human rights violations. who can be a greater transgressor of human rights than a terrorist? those who take innocent human lives in pursuit of war by other means are defenders of inhuman behavior, not of human rights. pakistan glorifies killers; it refuses to see the blood of innocents. it has become something of a habit with pakistan to throw the dust of deceit and deception against india in order to provide some thin cover for its own guilt. the united nations has seen this before. last year, pakistan's representative, using her right to reply, displayed some photographs as ""proof of ""human rights violations"" by india. the photographs turned out to be from another country. similar false accusations have become a part of its standard rhetoric. madam president, each year, for last five years, india has been arguing from this podium that lists are not enough to check terrorists and their protectors. we need to bring them to accountability through international law. in 1996, india proposed a draft document on ccit at the united nations. till today, that draft has remained a draft, because we cannot agree on a common language. on the one hand, we want to fight terrorism; on the other, we cannot define it. this is why terrorists with a price on their head are celebrated , finances and armed as liberation heroes by a country that remains a member of the united nations. cruelty and barbarism are advertised as heroism. the country prints postage stamps glorifying terrorists. if we do not act now, we will have to deal with conflagration later. once again, 1 appeal to this august body to come to an agreement, soon, on ccit as one of the necessary measures in a long running war. madam president, i began by highlighting the unique and positive role of the un: but i must add that step by slow step, the importance, influence, respect and value of this institution is beginning to ebb. it is time to wonder if we are wandering towards the fate of the league of nations. if 2030 is the agreed deadline for delivery on sustainable development goals, then it also marks hundred years of the lapse of the league into irrelevance. surely there is something to learn from this coincidence? the league went into meltdown because it was unwilling to accept the need for reform. we must not make that mistake. the united nations must accept that it needs fundamental reform. reform cannot be cosmetic. we need change the institution's head and heart to make both compatible to contemporary reality. reform must begin today; tomorrow could be too late. if the un is ineffective, the whole concept of multilateralism will collapse. in this session, multilateralism. there we will has been never much weaken debate the about multilateral mechanism. india believes that the world is a family, and the best mecins of resolution is shared discourse. a family is shaped by love and is not transactional; a family is nurtured by consideration not greed; a family believes in harmony not jealousy. greed breeds conflict; consideration leads to resolution. that is why the united nations must be based on the principles of the family. the un cannot be run by the t, it only works by the we'. india does not believe that the united nations should become the instrument of a few at the cost of the many. india believes that we must move forward together or we sink into the swamp of stagnation. madam president, this year india will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi. the mahatma's favorite bhajan was ""vaishnav jan to tene kahiye"". the essence is deeply moving and quintessentially important: he who understands the pain of another, and absorbs it as his own, is a good human being. he who sees this pain, aind helps without becoming arrogant, is a good human being'. madam president, we have to understanding, understand the nations to ease in our scheme make this assembly into a platform of assistance and true justice. we have to pain of other nations, and work with developed and eliminate this pain. arrogance has no place of things; arrogance is counter-productive and self-defeating. let us work for the benefit of the less fortunate. let us work for a world where there is peace, serenity and shared prosperity; a world that is free from terrorism, tension and violence. it is with this wish in mind that 1 end with a shloka from our sanskrit scriptures: may all experience well being; may all experience peace; may all move towards perfection; may all enjoy prosperity; may all achieve serenity. thank you. madam president.","sushma swaraj, minister for external affairs of india, highlighted how her country has initiated unprecedented economic and social transformations to achieve the sustainable development goals. india has implemented the world’s largest financial inclusion, health insurance and housing schemes — which will benefit millions — as well as entrepreneurship and skill development programs. these initiatives have at their core the welfare of women, she stressed, adding that, whereas some developed nations with big economies only offer six weeks of paid leave, women will get twenty‑six weeks under a new national scheme. underdeveloped and developing nations are the worst victims of climate change, she continued, underscoring that “those who have exploited nature for their immediate needs cannot abdicate their responsibilities”. developed nations must lift the deprived with financial and technical resources. the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities was reiterated in the 2015 paris agreement. india has risen to the challenge, notably by launching the international solar alliance in partnership with france. the alliance is now comprised of 68 members. terrorism, which represents the second existential threat to humanity, is bred across india’s border to the west, she said, adding: “our neighbor’s expertise is not restricted to spawning grounds for terrorism; it is also an expert in trying to mask malevolence with verbal duplicity.” the fact that osama bin laden, the architect of the 11 september 2001 attacks, was given safe haven in pakistan is evidence of this. challenging the idea that india is sabotaging peace talks, she said that such talks had begun many times and that if they stopped, it was only because of pakistan’s behavior. her country accepted pakistan’s proposal of a meeting between the two countries’ foreign ministers in new york. but, soon after, terrorists killed three of her country’s jawans [junior soldiers], she recalled, questioning the idea that this could indicate a desire for dialog. further, pakistan accuses india of violating human rights. yet, “those who take innocent lives in pursuit of war by other means are defenders of inhuman behavior, not of human rights”, she said. she reaffirmed the need to bring terrorists to accountability through international law and, underscoring that india proposed a draft document on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism at the united nations in 1996, she called on the general assembly to come to an agreement on this accord. the league of nations went into meltdown because it was unwilling to accept the need for reform. the united nations must not make that mistake, she said, urging those present to “change the institution’s head and heart to make both compatible to contemporary reality”."
Indonesia,"check a ainst delivery statement by the head of delegation of the republic of indonesia at the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly making the united nations reievant to ail people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable, and sustainable societies"" new york, september 29, 2018 madame president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, i join others in congratulating her excellency maria fernanda espinosa on her election as the president of the seventy-third session of the general assembly. rest assured, madame president, indonesia will give its full support for the success of your presidency. i also congratulate his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak, for his success in guiding the seventy-second session. let me also extend our deepest sympathies and condolences on the passing of the former un secretary-general kofi annan. the world has lost a great peacemaker and true humanist.... we will always remember his legacy. madame president, the world continues to face complex global challenges. where instabilities and conflicts are still rampant. extreme poverty and inequalities linger. zero-sum thinking and narrow-nationalism often prevail. and democracy and human rights violations still become day-to-day problems in our life. in times like this, we often mistakenly look to leadership that only has great strength... a leadership that has superhero-like power. however, madame president, the world does not need to look far for superheroes. we do not need to call on the strength of the avengers... nor that of the justice league. we in this room are global leaders. collectively, we have the strength of superheroes. what we must do is harness our own individual will, courage, strength, compassion, selflessness, and humility. this is the very essence the of united nations. where we all believe in the strength and power of the mantra in the un charter, we the peoples of the united nations . as global leaders -young and old... women and men we must work together... to encourage others... in achieving the goals and objectives of the united nations. this year s theme precisely captures what needs to be done by all of us... as a community of nations.... a community of leaders. the message is loud and clear. pursuing peace, equality, and sustainability for our people requires global leadership and shared responsibility. there is no effective leadership without genuine responsibility, and vice versa. my first point, global leadership and responsibility determine the outcome of our quest for lasting peace. peace is not merely the absence of war it is also about the commitment to peace. it is nothing other than continuous efforts to maintain stability and prevent conflict... from which we begin our pursuit of happiness. but this must start with genuine leadership. it must start first at home.... and in our own respective region. in our surroundings... to create an ecosystem of peace, stability, and prosperity. indonesia will always believe in this way of thinking. in doing so, of course, we cannot do it alone. . this is why as an elected non-permanent member of un security council next year, we will need your continued support. we are grateful for your trust and confidence... and we will do our best to become your true partner for peace. madame president, for the last five decades, we have enjoyed a long peace dividend in the asia pacific region. since geopolitical and geostrategic landscapes are changing so fast, indonesia sees the opportunity to also extend it to the larger indo-pacific region. along with other asean countries, we put forward an outlook of the indian and pacific regions as a single geostrategic theater. a region of cooperation, not competition... to support a greater global ecosystem of peace. madame president, the commitment and responsibility to peace must be replicated across all regions, including in the middle east. central to peace and stability in the middle east is the long-standing question of palestine. our commitment to peace will be questioned if we cannot resolve the palestinian-lsraeli conflict. setbacks continue to persist as we speak. imminent threat to the status quo of jerusalem... millions of palestinian refugees are at stake... humanitarian situation is getting worst day by day. the current situation does not only harm the peace process... it destroys the hopes of the palestinian people... the hopes of all of us.... for an independent palestinian state. international community can no longer remain in a standstill. we must call for an immediate negotiation that can make the two-state solution a reality. indonesia will continue to stand with the people of palestine... until the day palestine is truly independent. madame president, at the global level, indonesia is honored to have contributed to peacekeeping. indonesia has now contributed more than 3,500 personnel in 9 un missions, as the 8th largest troop/police contributing country. we will not stop there. we are ready to contribute 4,000 peacekeepers by 2019, with increasing proportion of female peacekeepers. beyond numbers, we believe that the un peacekeeping operations should continue to be the un s flagship enterprise. but it can only be achieved by improving its capacity in delivering its mandate. that is why we have endorsed the action for peacekeeping declaration. madame president, i will begin my seco d point with a question -after peace is achieved, will that peace be enough? peace should not be an end in itself. it must create an environment conducive for development. peace and development must go hand in hand as they are mutually reinforcing. only then can peace bring benefits for our people. it is for this reason that development goals and commitments were agreed upon. 2030 agenda and paris agreement on climate change are two obvious examples. another milestone has also been reached. the first ever global instrument on migration will be adopted in marrakesh in december. those agreements represent global leadership and shared responsibilities for a better future... where no one is left behind. no matter big or small... north or south... developed or developing countries. in short... these agreements shows our collective compassion, and selflessness... global leadership at its finest. the next questions - how are we going to live up to those commitments? the answer is that global leaderships needs to create conducive environment to achieve these commitments. very simple on paper, but not so straightforward in practice. three years after the adoption of the 2030 agenda, many success stories have been reached. however, result and progress may vary in different parts of the world. lingering conflicts, instability, protectionism and uncertain global economic outlook still hamper our common efforts to achieve the sdgs. regrettably, time is not on our side. some of the sdgs targets are running behind the schedule. to overcome this, the pace of implementation must be accelerated. decisive actions must be taken to improve access for financing, capacity building and technology. global leadership and partnership must be pursued to reach win-win future . madame president, as part of our global leadership and responsibility, indonesia has taken concrete steps to implement our commitments. through south-south and triangular cooperation, indonesia has offered more than 500 capacity building programs with more than 6,000 participants across the globe.... from asia to africa from the south pacific to the caribbean. we will soon launch the indonesia aid for development to reinforce the delivery of our international assistance. moreover, earlier this year... indonesia hosted the first ever indonesiaafrica forum.... as a testament of our strong commitment to promote “win- win cooperation with the african continent. further, as a follow-up, we will convene indonesia-africa infrastructure dialog next year.... focusing on infrastructure.. , to accelerate development in africa. as the largest archipelagic country in the world, we are fully aware on the adverse impact of climate change as it is mostly faced by small islands development states. the convening of the archipelagic and islands states conference and our ocean conference next month are proof of our firm leadership and commitment in addressing this matter. madame president, peace and development will only be sustained if we have an equitable society. this leads me to my third point on creating a society that is just, inclusive, democratic and respectful of human rights. an equitable, tolerant, and moderate society is key in addressing major challenges of violent extremism and radicalism. injustice, exclusivity, extreme poverty, illiteracy and massive youth unemployment must be uprooted. hard and soft power approaches must be improved. for this reason, we have amended our national law and strengthened our soft approach in adapting with new evolving challenges. the last horrific terrorist attack in surabaya, indonesia, has shown that the evolution of violence by terrorists knows no bounds. using children as weapons can never be right. but this attack will only strengthen our determination to work more closely with international community. madam president, to create peaceful, sustainable and equitable societies, all countries must respect international law and principles of the un, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. in this connection, indonesia strongly deplores the attempts of one country to support or even worst... become part of the separatist movements. this act of hostility has no place in the un system.... an act which is clearly in violation of un principles. for far too long... indonesia has chosen to build friendly relations with this particular country, including in showing our solidarity and sympathy during difficult time. but when such hostile acts continue... indonesia will not remain silent. indonesia will not let any country undermine its territorial inte rit . like any other sovereign country, indonesia will firmly defend its territorial integrity... i repeat: will firmly defend its territorial integrity. to conclude... madam president, i would like to reiterate that peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies require a more responsive, responsible, and credible united nations. we in the united nation must show leadership. this is why the un reform is inevitable. otherwise... the un will be obsolete to answer the needs and challenges of today and tomorrow. the goal of the un reform is crystal clear. it must be better positioned to help countries sustain peace and achieve the sdgs. all of us has a role to play. ...to keep the un relevant... and to ensure that the un delivers. indonesia stands ready to contribute to this noble goal for the sake of humanity. i thank you. 0o0 word count: 1628 (16 menit)","muhammad jusuf kalla, vice-president of indonesia, said that as the world grapples with conflicts, extreme poverty, inequality, zero‑sum thinking and narrow nationalism and democracy and human rights violations, people look for leadership from superhero‑like powers. “we do not need to call on the strength of the avengers or the justice league,” he said, arguing that the global leaders in the general assembly have the strength of individual will, courage, compassion, selflessness and humility. there is no effective leadership without genuine responsibility. lithuania will become a non‑permanent security council member in 2019 and a true partner for peace, he said, noting that peace is not merely the absence of war, it is the continuous effort to maintain stability and prevent conflict. turning to the asia‑pacific region, he said that as geopolitical and geostrategic landscapes are changing fast, indonesia and other association of southeast asian nations (asean) states see the larger region as a single geostrategic theater cooperating and not competing with each other. the commitment to peace and stability in the middle east will be questioned if the palestinian‑israeli conflict is not solved, he said, adding that indonesia supports the two‑state solution and a truly independent palestinian state. turning to peacekeeping, he noted indonesia’s contribution of more than 3,500 personnel to nine united nations missions and its readiness to deploy 4,000 more, including more women, by 2019. he endorsed the action for peacekeeping initiative to improve peacekeeping capacity. the 2030 agenda, paris agreement and the first ever global instrument on migration to be adopted in marrakesh in december demonstrate collective compassion, selflessness and global leadership at its finest. living up to these commitments is “very simple on paper, yet not so straightforward in practice”, he said, warning that time is running out. through south-south and triangular cooperation, indonesia has trained more than 6,000 participants in over 500 capacity‑building programs around the world, he said, citing plans to launch the indonesia aid for development program to reinforce the country’s international assistance. the first indonesia‑africa forum is a testament to his country’s strong commitment to “win‑win cooperation” with the african continent. he also cited the indonesia‑africa infrastructure dialog aimed at accelerating development in africa. as the largest archipelagic country in the world, indonesia is vulnerable to the impact of climate change, an issue to be addressed at the archipelagic and islands states conference and our ocean conference to take place next month. turning to the fight against violent extremism and radicalism, he said creating just, inclusive, democratic, equitable and tolerant societies is crucial. injustice, exclusivity, extreme poverty, illiteracy and massive youth unemployment must be uprooted, and hard and soft power approaches must be improved. pointing to the horrific terrorist attack in surabaya, indonesia, he said the evolution of violence by terrorists knows no boundaries, underscoring that using children as weapons can never be right. indonesia strongly deplores the attempts of one country to become part of the separatist movements, he

Iran (Islamic Republic of),"73rd session of the united nations general assembly annual general debate address by h.e. mr. hassan rouhani, president islamic republic of iran in the name of god, the merciful, the compassionate “praise be to god, the lord of the universe and peace and blessings be upon the messenger of god and his family and companions” madam president, i take this opportunity to felicitate your election to the presidency of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. we have assembled here today as the world is suffering from the recklessness and disregard of some states for international values and institutions. the message of our presence here is that the preservation of interests and security in the world in the least costly manner is solely possible through the cooperation of, and coordination among, countries. however, it is unfortunate that we are witnessing rulers in the world who think they can secure their interests better—or at least in the short-term ride public sentiments and gain popular support—through the fomenting of extremist nationalism and racism, and though xenophobic tendencies resembling a nazi disposition, as well as through the trampling of global rules and undermining international institutions; even through preposterous and abnormal acts such as convening a high-level meeting of the security council. this illusion should be cast away, once and for all, that one can aspire to securing more peace and security at the cost of denying others’ peace and security. we should not allow the breathing space for and growth of the line of thinking that holds others to ransom through the artificial creation of insecurity. along this tack, confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength; rather it is a symptom of the weakness of intellect—it betrays an inability in understanding a complex and interconnected world. under such circumstances, negligence or inefficacy of international institutions can endanger world peace. those seeking dominance and hegemony are enemies of peace and the perpetrators of war. the government of the united states—at least the current administration—seems determined to render all international institutions ineffectual. this government, having withdrawn from a multilateral agreement adopted by the security council, in contravention of the rules and norms of international law, invites the islamic republic of iran to bilateral talks. an administration that is inviting iran to engage in talks is not ready to consult its own experts nor willing to recognize the requirements of a modern state, including the paramount principle of continuity of state responsibility, and hence openly violates state obligations undertaken by its predecessor. on what basis and criteria can we enter into an agreement with an administration misbehaving such as this? any talks should be within the framework and in continuation of the jcpoa and security council resolution 2231, and not in a framework of breaching them and reverting to the past. it is ironic that the us government does not even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks! distinguished colleagues, the approach of the islamic republic of iran in the field of foreign policy has been based on multilateralism and compliance with the recognized principles of international law. our respect for the non-proliferation treaty and the long and difficult negotiations with the group of 5+1, which led to the conclusion of the joint comprehensive plan of action—the jcpoa—illustrates a clear manifestation of this approach. we are pleased that the international community did not acquiesce to the us government’s unilateral and illegal withdrawal from the jcpoa and adopted a categorical position vis-à-vis that decision. the jcpoa is the outcome of more than a decade of diplomatic efforts and a period of intensive negotiations to resolve an artificial crisis. this document was unanimously approved by security council resolution 2231 and codified into an international obligation. according to this resolution, all countries and international and regional organizations were called upon to support the implementation of the jcpoa, and to refrain from any actions that undermine implementation of commitments under the jcpoa. based on 12 consecutive reports of the international atomic energy agency – the iaea – iran has thus far complied with all of its commitments. however, the united states, from the very beginning, never remained faithful to its obligations. later, the current administration, resorting to flimsy excuses and in open violation of its commitments, finally withdrew from the accord. the united nations should not allow its decisions to fall victim to the domestic election and propaganda games of some of its members and should not allow any member state to dodge the execution of its international commitments. additionally, the united states also pressures other countries to violate the nuclear accord. and more dangerously, the united states is threatening all countries and international organizations with punishment if they comply with security council resolution 2231. it is the first time in the history of the united nations that such ‘a general invitation to violation of law’ is coupled with ‘threatening law-abiders with punishment.’ this is not just peculiar to the jcpoa, but a pattern that even applies to the us approach to the international criminal court. we appreciate the efforts of the international community, the european union, russia, and china in supporting the implementation of the jcpoa and consider the full realization of the commitments stipulated in it a precondition for the survival of this significant accomplishment of diplomacy. ladies and gentlemen, unlawful unilateral sanctions in themselves constitute a form of economic terrorism and a breach of the ‘right to development.’ the economic war that the united states has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the iranian people but also entails harmful repercussions for the people of other countries, and that war has caused a disruption in the state of global trade. the iranian people have demonstrated their unwavering resilience during the past forty years despite the difficulties and constraints caused by sanctions and have shown that they can overcome this difficult phase as well. the multi-millennial history of our country demonstrates that iran and iranians have never broken in the face of a storm of events—not even been bowed. i state here, in clear, unambiguous terms, that the united states policy vis-à-vis the islamic republic of iran has been wrong from the beginning, and its approach of resisting the wishes of the iranian people as manifested in numerous elections is doomed to failure. iran, with its historical and civilizational longevity, rich cultural heritage, and foremost geopolitical position, is an undeniable reality. the policy of engagement and cooperation with iran has produced positive outcomes for other nations, as best reflected in iran’s cooperation with friendly countries in the fight against terrorism. the united states’ understanding of international relations is authoritarian. in its estimation, might makes right. its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition. no state and nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force, and if so, what follows is the accumulation in the ‘grapes of wrath’ of those nations, to be reaped later by the oppressors. we concur that, at the end of the day, there is no better way but dialog. however, dialog is two-way: it should be based on equality, justice, and human integrity and honor, and conducted in accordance with the rules and norms of international law. un security council resolution 2231 is not a ‘piece of paper’. we invite you to return to that council resolution. we invite you to come back to the negotiating table you left. if you dislike the jcpoa because it is the legacy of your domestic political rivals, then we invite you to come back to the security council resolution. we invite you to remain in the international institutions. do not engage in imposing sanctions. sanctions and extremism are two sides of the same coin: extremism involves negating the thinking of others, and sanctions negate the life and prosperity of people. for dialog to take place, there is no need for a photo opportunity. the two sides can listen to each other right here in this assembly. i am starting the dialog right here, and state—in unequivocal terms—that the question of international security is not a toy in american domestic politics. the united nations is not a part of the united states administration. dialog can resume in this assembly from the same point and by the same person who left the dialog table and walked away from the accord. beginning the dialog starts with ending threats and unjust sanctions that negate the principles of ethics and international law. our proposal is clear: commitment for commitment; violation for violation; threat for threat; and step for step, instead of talk for talk. what iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfillment of obligations. we support peace and democracy in the entire middle east. we consider nuclear knowledge an imperative and nuclear weapons prohibited. as victims of terrorism in the past and today, we have always been and will always remain in the forefront of genuine confrontation with terrorism. today, we mourn the martyrdom of tens of innocent people, who were recently murdered in cold blood by terrorists who shamelessly accepted responsibility from a number of western capitals for their heinous crime in interviews with some western-based broadcasting outfits that are financed by petrodollars. in iran we have condemned all acts of terrorism without equivocation and will continue to do so. we welcome the strong statement from the security council on this issue. but why can the leaders of these terrorist operations – including the organization that has publicly claimed responsibility for saturday’s crime—live and operate freely in western countries, and even openly solicit funds? are these activities not in violation of international counter-terrorism norms? why have the official state-financiers of anti-iranian terrorist organizations –with their record of financing al-qaeda, isis and al nusrah—not only been spared any punishment but are supported and armed? if you want the world public to take your claim of fighting terrorism seriously, it is imperative to start a joint global campaign to fight this scourge, irrespective of the victims or culprits. distinguished colleagues, in the same vein, from the very beginning of the crisis in syria, we have warned against any foreign intervention in the internal affairs of this country and the use of unlawful means, including supporting extremist and terrorist groups in order to exert pressure on the government of syria, and have consistently emphasized that the crisis can only be resolved through intrasyrian dialog. to this end, the presence of our military advisors in syria has been at the request of the syrian government and consistent with international law and has aimed at assisting the syrian government in combatting extremist terrorism. iran, russia, and turkey, in cooperation with the government of syria and other syrian parties, have succeeded through the astana process, the third summit meeting of which took place in tehran earlier this month, in playing a positive role in reducing tension in syria, and in their last common effort have prevented escalation and bloodshed in the idlib region. we have witnessed a tragic humanitarian catastrophe in yemen over the past three years which has caused the destruction of infrastructure, the killing and injury of hundreds of thousands, the displacement of millions of innocent people, and the occurrence of widespread famine and chronic diseases. these inhuman acts represent clear examples of crimes against humanity and war crimes. the crisis in yemen can be resolved solely through intra-yemeni talks and without foreign interference. and to this end, we are ready to assist in any possible way. the most pressing crisis in the middle east, however, is the question of palestine. the passage of time cannot – and must not –justify occupation. the innumerable crimes of israel against the palestinians would not have been possible without the material and military assistance, and political and propaganda support of the united states. israel, equipped with a nuclear arsenal and blatantly threatening others with nuclear annihilation, presents the most daunting threat to regional and global peace and stability. the abhorrent u.s. decision to transfer its embassy in israel to jerusalem, and the recent enactment of the racist jewish state law are violations of international law and norms, and unmistakable manifestations of apartheid. madam president, the expansion of relations with neighbors and the creation of a more secure and more developed region are among the main priorities of iran’s foreign policy. a few weeks ago iran, along with the other four coastal states, signed the convention on the legal status of the caspian sea, which will strengthen good-neighborliness and bring prosperity and progress for all of the coastal states. we also desire the same relations with our southern neighbors in the persian gulf. we believe in the formation of a collective mechanism for the persian gulf region with the presence and participation of all regional countries. the security of the persian gulf and the strait of hormuz has always been important for us, and just as we defended this security during the war imposed on us by iraq, we will confront any and all disruptive efforts in this critical waterway in the future. we espouse a peaceful view in political and international issues and have not sought, nor do we seek, war with any country. iran does not need an empire. iran is an empire in terms of its civilization and its culture; not through political domination. iran has served as the link between east and west and will continue to do so; remaining a meticulous guardian for a world free from violence. the islamic republic of iran is the same state that understood the fascistic nature of the ba’athist regime in iraq before anyone else in the world, and bravely resisted its aggression against us. we fought against the ba’ath party of iraq before kuwait was occupied by it. the islamic republic of iran is the same state that was on the forefront of the struggle against taliban terrorism, and gave up martyrs in that struggle. we fought against al-qaida and the taliban before the attacks on new york and washington. the islamic republic of iran is the same state that fought against daesh – a fake, distorted representation of islam. we were engaged in the fight against daesh before their operations in paris, london and brussels. appreciate these historical realities about iran. quit imposing sanctions and end extremism. the world will not have a better friend than iran, if peace is what you seek. i thank you for your attention. ***","hassan rouhani, president of iran, said the world is suffering from recklessness and some states’ disregard for international values and institutions. the idea that peace and security can be secured at the cost of denying it to others is an illusion that should be cast away. “confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength; rather, it is a symptom of weakness of intellect,” he stated, adding that those who seek dominance and hegemony are enemies of peace. the current administration of the united states seems determined to render all international institutions ineffectual, he said. pointing out that that country’s withdrawal from the nuclear accord contravened international law, he emphasized that any further talks should take place within the framework and in continuation of the joint comprehensive plan of action and security council resolution 2231 (2015). “it is ironic that the [united states] government does not even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks,” he added. reaffirming his respect for the non‑proliferation treaty and the long negotiations with the permanent five members of the security council plus germany, known as the p5+1, that led to the plan of action, he said he was pleased that the international community did not acquiesce to the united states’ unilateral and illegal withdrawal from the accord. he recalled that the plan of action was unanimously approved by the security council, and that all countries and international and regional organizations were called upon to support its implementation. underscoring that iran has thus far complied with all its commitments according to the international atomic energy agency (iaea), he criticized the united states for resorting to a flimsy excuse to justify its withdrawal from the accord and pressuring other countries to violate it. he deplored that the united states threatens countries and international organizations with punishment if they comply with security council resolution 2231 (2015). he expressed appreciation for the efforts of the international community, the european union, russian federation and china in supporting the implementation of the plan of action. “unlawful unilateral sanctions in themselves constitute a form of ‘economic terrorism’,” he underscored. the policy of engagement and cooperation with iran has produced a positive outcome, he added, drawing attention to iran’s cooperation with other countries in the fight against terrorism. while acknowledging that, at the end of the day, there is no other way than dialog, he expressed objection to the united states’ bullying and stressed that no state or nation can be brought to the negotiation table by force. international security should not be a toy used in united states domestic politics, and dialog can restart if “threats and unjust sanctions that negate the principle of ethics and international law” are ended, he said. recalling that iran has been a victim of terrorism in the past and again recently, he expressed commitment to the fight against the scourge no matter who the victims are. he warned against any foreign intervention in syria and yemen, and emphasized that the crisis in these countries can only be resolved through internal dialog. the most pressing question in the middle east remains the situation in palestine, he stated, adding that “the passage of time cannot and must not justify occupation”. citing “the recent enactment of the racist jewish state law” as a manifestation of apartheid, he said israel presents the most daunting threat to global peace. he described iran as a “meticulous guardian for a world free from violence” and called on those present to “quit imposing sanctions and end extremism”. “the world will not have a better friend than iran if peace is what you seek,” he concluded."
Iraq,,"ibrahim abdulkarim al-jafari, minister for foreign affairs of iraq, recalled that four years ago he stood at the podium to share an overview of the situation in his country, a third of which was occupied by isil/da’esh with millions killed or expelled. “this could have been a historic catastrophe from which we might never have recovered,” he said. instead, iraqis stood together behind their faith and rose up to liberate their land. thanking the united nations for standing beside iraq during that dark time, he said isil “is now breathing its last breath” in syria before being snuffed out. iraq is now working to help those returning home and to strengthen its state institutions. it has joined the club of democratic nations, built on an inclusive, constitutional consensus. urging countries to fulfill the financial commitments made to his country during a recent donor conference in kuwait, he said “this is a new chapter in iraq’s story”. a national economic, social and cultural plan is in place – with a focus on young people and women – in order to reduce unemployment, provide job opportunities, protect diversity and combat extremist narratives. welcoming the work of the united nations assistance mission for iraq (unami) as well as the special envoy of the secretary‑general, he said displaced persons are being helped to return, while evidence of war crimes is being collected and those responsible will be held accountable. the international community should continue to stand with iraq, he stressed, voicing support for the universalization of all disarmament conventions and a strengthening of the global non‑proliferation regimes. iraq suffered greatly from the use of weapons of mass destruction, namely chemical weapons, during its dictatorship. moreover, peace will not be possible in the middle east until israel completely withdraws from the occupied palestinian territory and an independent palestinian state is established. condemning the united states recent decision to move its embassy to jerusalem – which he said will only further complicate the situation – he also warned against the unilateral imposition of sanctions that only hurt civilians, as was long felt first‑hand in iraq. turning to syria, he called for a balanced political solution that will allow for an end to the long‑standing bloodbath as well as attempts to impose a military solution. in yemen, all external meddling must cease, he said, rejecting the presence of fighters from turkey and calling on the latter to end its violations of the sovereignty of neighboring states. rejecting statements made by the minister of the zionist entity - who attempted in his speech to justify an attack on iraqi sovereignty - he said iraq will remain a cradle of peace and diversity. “we are proud of our society and our history,” he concluded."
Ireland,"... and statement by mr. simon coveney, t.d. tanaiste (deputy prime minister) and minister for foreign affairs and trade at the united nations general assembly general debate 73rd session of the united nations general assembly new york 28 september, 2018 permanent iission of ireland to the united nations 885 second avenue, new york, ny 10017 telephone 212 421-6934 fax 212 752-4726 newforkpmun@dfa.ie president, the general assembly is meeting this week as we mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of nelson mandela and as we mourn the recent death of kofi annan. two great leaders from africa whose personal commitment to the values and principles of multilateralism was unwavering - something we should reflect on and draw inspiration from, particularly at this time of global instability and open challenge to the very approach to global decision-making that has been the foundation of this i stitution. ireland was honored to have been asked to co-facilitate the consultative process with member states to produce the political declaration adopted at the ma dala peace summit on monday. nelson mandela and kofi annan were revered a d loved in ireland. to do justice to their legacy, we must renew our efforts to actively work for a culture of peace, tolerance and respect for human dignity globally. is that not fundamentally what the un should be about? can we challenge ourselves to use the peace summit and this unga week to strive, with the courage and humility which marked them out, for the type of world that mandela and arman envisioned? we must do better - and we can do better - to live up to the aspirations they represented. president, geographically, ireland may be a small island on the western edge of europe. but in ireland we see ourselves as an island at the center of the world, with a global diaspora more than ten times the size of our population at home. we have learned that, in an inter¬ dependent world, the challenges of our time do not respect geographic boundaries. finding solutions is a shared responsibility, whether you are a small polynesian island or a superpower - we breathe the same air. this sense of shared responsibility guides ireland s view of the world and the part we try to play in it. almost a century ago ireland became an independent state, escaping a history of colonialism. ours is not a unique story; but it is one which allows us to empathize with so many countries here at the un. 1 like the lin itself, we were bom out of conflict. it has shaped how we view the world and our responsibilities as global citizens. our membership of the un has played a major part in our development. we not only support a fair rules-based order in inte ational affairs - we exist, survive and rosper because of it. and we see no viable alternative. in peacekeeping, disarmament, sustainable development, climate, nutrition, human rights and humanitarian assistance we have striven to match our words with actions and funding, supporting multilateral structures. while the system has flaws, ireland is convinced that there is no other way to meaningfully address the common opportunities and threats that face each of us. for ireland, multilateralism strengthens our independence, self-confidence and security, rather than diminishes it. if you believe in multilateralism, now is the time to fight for it across the un system, including with powerful countries which have traditionally played great leadership roles within this institution. we cannot defend a logic that views multinational engagement as an abdication of national leadership or a loss of influence on the inte ational stage. we urgently need global leadership which galvanizes global support through strength of argument, which leads in finding solutions to our collective problems, to raise living standards for everyone, in particular those furthest behind. we need positive outward-looking leadership by the great powers in the un, particularly powers which traditionally have been indispensable, if imperfect, forces for good. without this, i fear for the future of global stability. i fear for the future of the un in the work it must do, work that can never be replicated by transactional bilateral engagement; where the powerful dominate and decisions are no longer based on the strength of argument, compassion or generosity but instead based on states choosing sides, fearful of being offside with the strong and powerful or being put on a list for special treatment. ireland does not wish to see any diminution in the role played by the un s leading actors. at the same time, we will always demand a place on the stage for everyone and an atmosphere that encourages free speech and new or sometimes controversial thinking. the un s foundations will crumble without the inclusivity and generosity of thinking embedded though decades of experience. and sometimes it’s the smallest states that have the answers to our biggest problems. we cannot be complacent, however, about the institutional reforms needed to maximize the un’s legitimacy and relevance in a changing world. ireland salutes the efforts of secretarygeneral guterres and welcomes the steps taken by the general assembly on reform. implementation of these reforms is now key. ireland particularly wants to see successful reform of the un development system to support the implementation of the sustainable development goals. that is why my government earlier this month pledged ore than a million dollars in support of the reform of the un development system to complement the strong financial support ireland already provides to un funds, programs and agencies. but reforms at the un must go beyond the managerial and structural level. the un’s political bodies must also catch up to where the world is. this is particularly the case regarding the security council. ireland is clear on the need to increase the size of the council. many areas of the world are either insufficiently represented in the security council or not at all represented. the historic unjust under-representation from africa in particular needs to be addressed so that there can be a fair african say in council decisions affecting their own continent, where much of the un’s focus will be needed in the decades ahead. we also want to see consideration of a designated role for small island developing states. the growing impact of climate change on international peace and security lends weight to this call. it is not only the composition of the security council that should be under scrutiny. the use or threat of the veto remains a serious obstacle to the work of the council. far too often, this results in the shocking abandonment of some of the most vulnerable people on earth. the failure of the security council to take action to prevent mass atrocity crimes betrays victims and undermines the un s credibility. i strongly believe that political reform of the council would inevitably lead to a greater sense of articipation, res onsibility and ownership among the un membershi - this would surely only be positive for the functioning of the un more widely. many say we are wasting our time calling for reform of the security council. maybe so, but if the power of evidence and argument is to mean anything then ireland will keep trying to build a coalition for change. president, while recognizing the need for new structures, we also need to make the best use of existing structures and always look for ways to improve them. international criminal justice, where there has been an irreversible shift towards accountability, is one such example. it is particularly pertinent to recall this on the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the rome statute of the international criminal court. justice and accountability is always a better alternative to revenge, impunity or amnesty. and we have seen important developments in the area of gender-based and sexual violence, by enabling the prosecution of sexual violence as a war crime, a crime against humanity and genocide. we have witnessed universal justice strengthened beyond power politics and beyond geopolitical interests. and i am pleased to report that earlier this month ireland ratified the amendments to the rome statue of the international criminal court on the crime of aggression which were agreed in kampala. yesterday i lodged the instrument of ratification with the un secretary-general. president, ireland welcomes the level of ambition at the heart of the secretary-general’s new disarmament agenda. we hope this will be a turning point in the current challenges facing disarmament and arms control processes. ireland is proud of the historic role we played in the development of the non-proliferation treaty in the last century. the npt demonstrates what states can achieve together in the spirit of peace and cooperation. however, we also have a responsibility to remain ambitious in the pursuit of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. our efforts to promote the adoption of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons reflect this. ireland is deeply concerned by the persistent use of explosive weapons in populated areas in armed conflicts across the globe. civilian populations continue to bear the brunt of armed conflicts and we all must redouble our efforts to fulfill the secretary-general s call to address this challenge. we continue to call on the dprk to abide by its obligations under relevant united nations security council resolutions and its international commitments, and to abandon all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction (wmd) and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner. president, ireland s multilateralism runs deep through our commitment to un peacekeeping. our contribution to un eacekeeping operations enjoys a special place in the hearts of the irish people. this year marks the 60th anniversary of ireland’s participation in un peacekeeping. for six decades, tens of thousands of irish women and men have worn the blue helmets and berets on un peacekeeping operations, particularly on missions in africa and the middle east. our prime minister stated here at u headquarters in july: we are as proud of the blue helmet as we are of the harp or the shamrock - two emblems that are closely associated with ireland. today, there are more than 500 irish defense forces personnel deployed on un peacekeeping missions, including more than 350 women and men on the unifil mission in lebanon, a mission that we have been contributing to for 40 years now. ireland is the highest per capita european union contributor of troops to un peacekeeping with deployments to 6 un missions across the middle east and africa. the un’s humanitarian and development work is central to ireland’s commitment to the un, but we know we need to do more. we have reaffirmed our commitment to achieving the un target of providing 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance by 2030 - the same year the world has pledged to deliver the sustainable development goals. we are ambitious for ireland s international development cooperation. we also need to be authentic to our own experiences. we have known hunger. we have known poverty. but we have also experienced transformation, a transformation based on education and innovation and a vibrant civil society. ou values are not ireland s alone, however. they are at the core of the 2030 agenda and the future we seek. we know that to create a peaceful, fair and just world, we must respect the human rights of all. economic progress cannot be delivered at the cost of equality and protecting the most vulnerable in our societies. we must also go beyond rhetoric in our efforts to empower women and girls. gender equality cannot be seen as a gift to be granted, but rather as a fundamental driver which can underpin real improvements in the lives of all of our people. president, the need for collective action to address climate change is more evident every month. as an island state, we learned centuries ago that the waters surrounding our island cannot deter forces beyond our control - isolation does not mean safety. since i spoke here last year ireland has experienced its first hurricane, generated in the east atlantic, its most severe winter cold weather snap and the most sustained drought in living memory. the denial needs to end and the collective action on climate adaptation and abatement must intensify. today many more island nations face challenges not of their making, through climate change, pollution and rising seas. we must work together to face these challenges, nations united by a determination to protect ourselves. more broadly, the scale of the humanitarian crises facing the inte ational community cannot be overstated. over 134 million people around the world are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, with conflict the single greatest driver of this need. as a country committed to humanitarian principles, we will continue contributing to inte ational efforts to ease the plight of civilians suffering the impact of conflicts in south sudan, the central african republic, syria, yemen, palestine and elsewhere. over 68 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes worldwide, with over 25 million cross-border refugees. i am very conscious that a huge majority of displaced people are being sheltered in countries already experiencing high levels of vulnerability and poverty, and that this is placing a huge strain on already very limited resources. ireland will continue to support refugees and vulnerable host communities. i particularly want to acknowledge the generosity of many states and the extraordinary burden they are being ask to carry. states like bangladesh, ethiopia, egypt, jordan, kenya, lebanon, pakistan, turkey and uganda, and many more - these countries are hosting enormous numbers of people displaced by conflicts in neighboring regions. bangladesh is now host to the world s largest refugee camp, sheltering over a million refugees. in the year since i last addressed you, this ca p has swelled with hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees fleeing appalling violence in neighboring rakhine state. the rohingya must be assured of a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return. and the international community must insist on an end to impunity for the appalling acts of violence that have come to light and ensure accountability for the crimes that have been committed. president, because of ireland’s experience of prolonged, intractable conflict but also a successful peace settlement, the israel palestine conflict and lack of progress on a peace agreement is a big foreign policy priority for me and for the irish government. ireland’s own e perience shows that even decades-long conflicts can have a turning point. peace is a process, not a moment. to bear fruit, that process requires untiring work and commitment. and we all surely realize that forced outcomes with winners and losers can never be the basis for lasting peace. from all my visits to the middle east, i know that the current situation serves the interests of neither people. but i am also conscious that the burden of being under occupation is the heavier one. settlement construction underlines this, and is causing ever-greater damage to the prospects for peace. ireland, like many, is very conscious of the threat to khan al ahmar and other strategically-located west bank villages. what happens there will tell us much about whether we can count on a real commitment to negotiating a two-state solution. the situation in gaza, also, is simply untenable, and the 1.9 million people living there desperately need the decadelong blockade to end, so that they can start to rebuild normal lives, reject the twisted promises of radicals, and look to the future ith hope. they also need countries which fund terrorist activities, c aos and mismanagement in gaza to halt this unwelcome interference without delay. when i visited gaza, i was struck by how much people there rely on the efforts of unrwa, both to meet basic needs, and to know that they are not forgotten. i am proud that ireland is such a long-standing supporter of unrwa, not just in gaza, but in the west bank and across the region. ireland will continue that assistance and has increased our contribution to €7m for this year, recognizing the financial pressures. i greatly regret recent cuts to unrwa s funding by the us and plead with those in power to reconsider the consequence of their decisions. reform of unrwa is needed, but in the context of a peace deal and a f nctioning palestinian state. shutting off funding now is simply adding to the turmoil of current pressures where unrwa cuts are interpreted as a collective punishment, targeting women and children. how does increasing the misery of palestinians not empower the radicals, who want to poison the minds of hopeless, angry, young palestinians and destabilize the moderate political leadership who want peace? a people who have been downtrodden for decades will not be pressured into negotiating through enforced hardship and humiliation - the human soul doesn t work that way. without hope or dignity, minds close to the compromises we all know are necessary. i believe there is a way forward for the middle east peace process with a erican leadership and with the support of others that can help to broker a peace deal between an israel that justifiably demands security and a palestinian people who dream of their own country and state. ireland is a small player in all of this, but we will continue to advocate honestly for progress and justice as a friend of both israel and palestine. president, member states know that ireland is a proud and ambitious candidate for a seat on the security council at the elections to be held in 2020. we have been making our case better known with states over the past months. we irish are by nature bridge-builders. we listen to all sides and work to build collective solutions to our global challenges. we are committed to hearing and heeding the voices of all, to forge consensus and common purpose. we thin independently. our path is our own. we bring no partisan agenda to the table. we are here to serve the wider good and to support the un and the multilateral system. and we will be courageous when the un, and all of you, need courage and leadership from the security council. empathy, partnership and independence will guide us. with ireland, you have a small country with a broad mind, a listening ear and a strong independent voice that promotes the values that should inspire this organization in the future. thank you.","simon coveney, deputy prime minister of ireland, said his country was honored to have been asked to co‑facilitate the consultative process to produce the political declaration adopted at the nelson mandela peace summit and encouraged member states to use that event as a motivating force to renew efforts to work for a culture of peace, tolerance and human dignity. he said that given ireland’s large diaspora population, the irish know well that today’s challenges do not respect geographic boundaries, and are guided by a sense of shared responsibility. the united nations has played a major part in ireland’s development, he said. “we not only support a fair rules‑based order in international affairs — we exist, survive and prosper because of it.” he called for global outward‑looking leadership which galvanizes global support through strength of argument, fearing that without such leadership the powerful will dominate and decisions will no longer be based on the strength of argument. while ireland does not wish for any diminution in the role played by the leading actors of the united nations, he said the organization’s foundations will crumble without inclusivity and welcomed the secretary‑general’s steps on reform. however, reforms should go beyond the managerial and structural level, he said, also calling to increase the size of the security council to better represent all areas of the world. in particular, the unjust under‑representation of africa needs to be addressed, he said, also advocating for a designated role for small island developing states given the climate change threat they face. political reform of the council will lead to a greater sense of participation and ownership among member states, he said. he went on to say that progress in international criminal justice has provided a shift towards global accountability, recalling that ireland ratified the amendments to the rome statute of the international criminal court on the crime of aggression earlier this month and lodged the instrument of ratification with the secretary‑general on 27 september. he emphasized the need to remain steadfast in the pursuit of the elimination of nuclear weapons and called on the democratic people’s republic of korea to abide by its obligations. ireland remains committed to united nations peacekeeping with large irish contributions to the united nations interim force in lebanon (unifil) and is the highest per capita european union contributor of peacekeeping troops in general. regarding the migration crisis, a huge majority of those displaced are being sheltered in already vulnerable countries, he said, acknowledging the burden on many states and in particular bangladesh, and pledging his country’s support to refugees and host communities. while acknowledging the current situation in the middle east serves neither the israelis nor the palestinians, the burden of occupation is the heavier one, he said, citing continued settlement construction as an existential threat to the two‑state solution. the situation in gaza is untenable, he continued, calling for an end to the blockade there and pledging his country’s continued support of unrwa. he greatly regretted the recent cuts to its funding by the united states and urged those in power to reconsider their decisions as those cuts will only be seen as collective punishment, thus empowering radicals and destabilizing moderates. in closing, he reiterated ireland’s candidacy for a seat on the security council in the 2020 elections, saying that his country will act as bridge‑builders there, committed to hearing all voices with no partisan agenda."
Israel,"73rd session of the united nations general assembly annual general debate address by h.e. mr. benjamin netanyahu prime minister of israel new york, 27 september 2018 distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, when i spoke here, three years ago, israel stood alone among the nations. of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this hall, only israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with iran. we oppose it because it threatens our future, even our very survival. we oppose it because the deal paved iran’s path to a nuclear arsenal. and by lifting the sanctions, it’s fueled iran’s campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the middle east. we oppose it, we oppose it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie—that iran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons. now, israel exposed that lie earlier this year. last february, israeli conducted a daring raid on iran’s secret atomic archive. we obtained over 100,000 documents and videos that had been stashed in vaults in an innocent looking building in the heart of tehran. in may, i presented a short summary of what we obtained to the international media. i provided hard evidence of iran’s plans to build nuclear weapons and its plans to deceive the international community. israel shared this information and even more damning evidence that we found with members of the p5+1, and with the international atomic energy agency. months have passed. the iaea has still not taken any action. it has not posed a single question to iran. it has not demanded to inspect a single new site discovered in that secret archive. so, given this inaction, i decided to reveal today something else that we have shared with the iaea and with a few intelligence agencies. what i’m about to say has not been shared publically before. today, i am disclosing for the first time that iran has another secret facility in tehran—a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from iran’s secret nuclear weapons program. in may, we exposed the site of iran’s secret atomic archive, right here, in the shor-abad district of tehran. today i’m revealing the site of a second facility— iran’s secret atomic warehouse. it’s right here, in the turquz-abad district of tehran, just there miles away. let me show you exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like. here it is. you see, like the atomic archive, it’s another innocent looking compound. now for those of you at home using google earth, this no-longer-secret atomic warehouse is on maher alley, maher street. you have the coordinates, you can try to get there. and for those of you who try to get there, it’s 100 meters from the kalishoi, the rug cleaning operation. by the way, i hear they do a fantastic job cleaning rugs there. but by now they may be radioactive rugs. this is the second secret site. now, countries with satellite capabilities may notice some increased activity on maher alley in the days and weeks ahead. the people they’ll see scurrying back and forth are iranian officials desperately trying to finish the job of cleaning up that site. because, you see, since we raided the atomic archive, they’ve been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. just last month, they removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material. you know what they did with it? they had 15 kilograms of radioactive material, they had to get it out of the site, so they took it out and they spread it around tehran in an effort to hide the evidence. the endangered residents of tehran may want to know that they can get a geiger counter on amazon for only $29.99. as of today that’s just 4 million iranian rials, but we’ll get to that later. i’ll talk about the iranian economy in a minute. they took this radioactive material and spread it around tehran. now, the iranian officials cleaning out that site still have a lot of work to do because they’ve had at least, at least 15 ship containers, they’re gigantic, 15 ship containers full of nuclear related equipment and material stored there. now, since each of those containers can hold 20 tons of material, this means that this site contains as much as 300 tons, 300 tons of nuclear related equipment and material. right here. so, distinguished delegates, you have to ask yourself a question. why did iran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic warehouse? because, after all, when south africa and libya, when they gave up their nuclear programs, the first thing they did was to destroy both the archives and the material and equipment. and the answer to the question is simple. the reason iran didn’t destroy its atomic archive and its atomic warehouse is because it hasn’t abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons. in fact, it planned to use both of these sites in a few years when the time would be right to break out to the atom bomb. but, ladies and gentlemen, rest assured, that won’t happen. it won’t happen because what iran hides, israel will find. ladies and gentlemen, i have a message to the head of the iaea, mr. yukiya amano. i believe he’s a good man. i believe he wants to do the right thing. well, mr. amano, do the right thing. go inspect this atomic warehouse, immediately, before the iranians finish clearing it out. distinguished delegates, do you remember when we were promised that inspections could take place anytime, anywhere? remember that? anytime, anywhere? well, how about inspections right here, right now. and mr. amano, while you’re at it, inspect the other secret sites we told you about. once and for all, tell the world the truth about iran. now, i also have a message today for the tyrants of tehran: israel knows what you’re doing, and israel knows where you’re doing it. israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons. not now, not in ten years, not ever. and israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against iran’s aggression. we will continue to act against you in syria. we will act against you in lebanon. we will act against you in iraq. we will act against you whenever and wherever we must act to defend our state and defend our people. distinguished delegates, three years ago, a few weeks after the nuclear deal was completed, i asked this question from this very podium: does anyone seriously believe that flooding iran’s radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression? but many of the deal’s supporters believed just that. they believed that iran’s regime would become more moderate, more peaceful. they believed that iran would use the billions of dollars it received in sanctions relief to improve the lives of its people—to solve the water problem, to solve the trucking problem, to solve the electricity problem, hospitals, schools… that’s what they believed, and perhaps many of you also believed that. well, this didn’t happen. instead, iran used the money to fuel its vast war machine. just this past year, iran has attacked kurds in iraq, slaughtered sunnis in syria, armed hezbollah in lebanon, financed hamas in gaza, fired missiles into saudi arabia, and threatened freedom of navigation in the straits of hormouz and the strait of bab al mandeb. some peace. some moderation. and if you think, if you think that iran’s aggression has been confined to the middle east, think again. last month, two iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks right here in the united states. and several weeks ago, iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks in the heart of europe. yet while the united states is confronting iran with new sanctions, europe and others are appeasing iran by trying to help it bypass those sanctions. now i just used a word, a tough word, a very strong word—appeasement, and i use it reluctantly, but unfortunately, that’s exactly what we are seeing again in europe. think about this: the same week iran was caught red-handed trying to murder european citizens, european leaders were rolling out the red carpet for president rouhani, promising to give iran even more money. i’m an historian’s son, i have to ask. i ask not merely as an historian’s son, i ask it as a jew, as a citizen of the world, as someone who’s lived through the 20th century: have these european leaders learned nothing from history? will they ever wake up? well, we in israel, we don’t need a wakeup call, because iran threatens us every day. because despite the best of hope, and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal, this deal did not push war further away. it brought war ever closer to our borders. in syria, iran is trying to establish permanent military bases against us and has already launched missiles and drones into our territory. in gaza, iran is arming terror groups to launch rocket attacks into our cities and terror attacks against our civilians. in lebanon, in lebanon iran is directing hezbollah to build secret sites to convert inaccurate projectiles into precision guided missiles, missiles that can target deep inside israel within an accuracy of ten meters. hezbollah, listen to this, hezbollah is deliberately using the innocent people of beirut as human shields. they have placed three of these missile conversion sites alongside beirut’s international airport. here’s a picture that’s worth a thousand missiles. here’s beirut’s international airport. here’s the first missile site. it’s in the ouzai neighborhood on the water’s edge, a few blocks away from the runway. here’s the second site. it’s underneath a soccer stadium, that’s the soccer stadium, two blocks way. and here’s the third site. it’s adjacent to the airport itself, right next to it. so i also have a message for hezbollah today: israel knows, israel also knows what you’re doing. israel knows where you’re doing it. and israel will not let you get away with it. ladies and gentlemen, just as the nuclear deal supporters were wrong about what would happen when sanctions would be removed, they were wrong, dead wrong, about what would happen when sanctions would be restored. they argued that us sanctions alone would have little impact, little economic impact on iran. that’s what they said. really? well, let’s see what happened to iran’s economy now that president trump has forced companies to choose between doing business with iran and doing business with the united states, whose gdp is 50 times the size of iran’s gdp. a year ago, iran’s economy was booming. now it’s collapsing. iran’s currency is plummeting. inflation and unemployment are soaring. british airlines, german banks, french oil companies, japanese oil importers and many others are scrambling to get out. if that’s little economic impact, imagine what will happen with the next batch of us sanctions imposed in november. the deal’s supporters were also wrong when they argued, you have to believe that they argue this. we’re going to have many arguments with them. they also argued that restoring sanctions would rally the iranian people around the regime. well, they’re definitely rallying, but not around the regime. they’re rallying against the regime. they’re not chanting death to america. they’re chanting death to the dictator. they’re not chanting export the islamic revolution. they’re chanting leave syria! leave lebanon! leave gaza! take care of us in iran! i listen to these protests. i talk to the iranian people. i issue these videos and i get so many responses from iranians. at first, i thought these are iranian exiles in the safety of london or paris or los angeles. no. iranians, from iran embracing israel, criticizing the regime. that’s an understatement. with their names. and i ask my intelligence people, what’s going on. and shortly after the protests broke out, not because of what i said, but it was an indicator of something extraordinary that was taking place there. because in these protests, the iranian people are showing unbelievable courage. from the urban centers to the outlying villages—and it’s embracing now the whole of iran— from the striking bazaar merchants to the young women uncovering their hair, the people of iran are bravely standing up to a regime that has brutally repressed them for four decades and that has squandered their money, still squanders their money in bloody wars across the middle east. so here’s what i say to europe’s leaders and to others: instead of coddling iran’s dictators, join the us, and israel, and most of the arab world in supporting new sanctions against a regime that endangers all of us and all of the world. israel is deeply grateful to president trump for his bold decision to withdraw from the disastrous nuclear deal with iran. many, many of our arab neighbors are also grateful. and everyone who cares about the peace and security of the world should also be grateful. but, ladies and gentlemen, i have an important confession to make. this may surprise you, but i have to admit that the iran deal has had one positive consequence, an unintended one, but a positive consequence. by empowering iran, it brought israel and many arab states closer together than ever before, closer together than ever before, in an intimacy and friendship that i’ve not seen in my lifetime and would have been unimaginable a few years ago. and you know, when you form friendships around a threat, around a challenge, you quickly see opportunities, not only for security, but how to bring a better life for our people which israel can help and wants to help do. israel deeply values these new friendships, and i hope the day will soon arrive when israel will be able to expand peace, a formal peace, beyond egypt and jordan to other arab neighbors, including the palestinians. i look forward to working with president trump and his peace team to achieve that goal. i also want to use this opportunity, we’re here at the un—it’s a place i know because i served here as ambassador many years ago for many years, so i know something about the un. so i want to use this opportunity to express israel’s appreciation to president trump and ambassador haley for the unwavering support they have provided israel at the united nations. they have unequivocally backed israel’s right to defend itself. they rightly pulled out of a history-denying unesco and a morally bankrupt un human rights council. they have more resolutions about israel than the rest of the world combined, i think. and tenfold compared to, i don’t know, iran, syria, you name it. not even tenfold, because you can’t multiply zero by any number. they stopped funding, president trump and ambassador haley, they stopped funding an unreformed unrwa, an organization that instead of solving the palestinian refugee problem, perpetuates it. day after day, the trump administration has stood up to what has long been a specialty here at the un—slandering israel. even though the shameful resolution comparing zionism to racism was repealed 25 years ago, i’m sorry to say that its foul stench still clings to these halls. israel airlifted ethiopian jews to freedom and a new life in israel, in the jewish state. yet here at the un, here at the un, israel is absurdly accused of racism. israel’s arab citizens vote in our elections, serve in our parliament, preside over our courts, and have exactly the same individual rights as all other israeli citizens. yet here at the un, israel is shamefully accused of apartheid. today, there are at least five times as many palestinians as there were in 1948, the year of israel’s founding. yet here at the un, israel is outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing. ladies and gentlemen, you know what this is? it’s the same old antisemitism with a brand new face. that’s all it is. once, it was the jewish people that were slandered and held to a different standard. today, it’s the jewish state that is slandered and held to a different standard. here’s an example: take the outlandish attacks that have been leveled against israel after our knesset, our parliament, recently adopted a law declaring israel the nation state of the jewish people. mind you, israel is a free country. you can oppose a law, and people did. you can call for different wording in this or that clause, or you can call to add or subtract a clause. you can do that. but when israel is called racist, israel is called racist for making hebrew its official language and the star of david its national flag, when israel is labeled an apartheid state for declaring itself the nation state of the jewish people, this is downright preposterous. and you know why? because represented in this hall today are more than 100 countries that have only one official language, even though many other languages are commonly spoken within those countries. there are more than 50 countries here that have crosses or crescents on their flags, even though they have many non-muslims and non-christians, many of them, living in their midst. and there are dozens of countries that define themselves as nation states of a particular people, even though there are many ethnic and national minorities within their borders. none of those countries are denigrated or libeled for celebrating their unique national identity. only israel is denigrated. only israel is libeled. what is unique about the jewish people is not that we have a nation state. what is unique is that many still oppose us having a nation state. moments ago, president abbas outrageously said that israel’s nation state law proves that israel is a racist, apartheid state. president abbas, you should know better. you wrote a dissertation denying the holocaust. your palestinian authority imposes death sentences on palestinians for selling land to jews. did you hear that? if a jew buys an apartment, a piece of land anywhere in the palestinian territories, the palestinian who sold him that land is executed. that’s what the law says. president abbas, you proudly pay palestinian terrorists who murder jews. in fact, the more they slay, the more you pay. that’s in their law too. and you condemn israel’s morality? you call israel racist? this is not the way to peace. this is not the way to achieve the peace we all want and need and to which israel remain committed. this body should not be applauding the head of a regime that pays terrorists. the un should condemn such a despicable policy. and the un, the un which brokered a ceasefire in 2014, should demand that hamas release our fallen soldiers oron shaul and hadar goldin, who was kidnapped when hamas violated that very ceasefire. hamas should also release the two israeli citizens it holds captive, abera mengistu and hisham al sayed. ladies and gentlemen, every time i stand here, i feel as i do today. i am privileged to stand here as the prime minister of the jewish and democratic state of israel. some believe that israel cannot be both jewish and democratic. this is false. israel is both, and israel will always remain both. ever since abraham and sarah made their journey to the promised land nearly 4,000 years ago, the land of israel has been our homeland. it’s the place where isaac and rebecca, jacob, leah and rachel carried on their eternal covenant with god. it is where joshua made us a sovereign nation, where david ruled and isaiah preached, where the maccabees fought and where masada fell. it is the place from which we were exiled and to which we returned, rebuilding our ancient and eternal capital jerusalem. the nation state of israel is the only place where the jewish people proudly exercise our collective right of self-determination. that right was recognized nearly a century ago by the league of nations and over 70 years ago by the united nations, when it voted to support the establishment of a jewish state. that’s what it said, that resolution—a jewish state. at the same time, israel is a vibrant democracy, where all its citizens—jews and non-jews alike—enjoy equal individual rights, and these rights are guaranteed by law. in israel, whether you are a jew or an arab, a christian or a muslim, a druze or a beduin, or anything else, your individual rights are exactly the same, and they will always remain the same. in the middle east, that’s not obvious, now that’s an understatement, in the middle east, where women are often treated as property, minorities are persecuted, gays are hanged, israel stands out as a shining example of freedom and progress. ladies and gentlemen, i could not be more proud to represent my country israel. i am proud that we’ve made israel a global technological power of breathtaking creativity, in information technology, in precision agriculture, you know what that is? we target the fertilizer and the water down to the individual plant, not field, not part of a field, down to the plant. i’m proud of these geniuses, that bring these unbelievable developments, in water management, in cyber security, in autonomous vehicles, in digital health, in medical devices and in so many other fields that are improving the lives of billions of people around the world. i am proud of israel’s brilliant scholars, innovative entrepreneurs and talented artists. i am proud of israel’s devoted teachers, compassionate doctors, and our search-and-rescue teams who save lives from haiti to mexico, from nepal to the philippines. i am proud, i am so proud of israel’s courageous soldiers, the men and women who bravely defend our homeland while upholding the highest values. and most of all, ladies and gentlemen, most of all i am proud of the people of israel, who draw extraordinary strength from the deep wellsprings of our heritage, who possess an unbreakable spirit and who are determined as ever to build a secure and magnificent future for the one and only jewish state. thank you. ***","benjamin netanyahu, prime minister of

still not taken any action and has not posed a single question to iran, nor has it demanded to inspect a single new site discovered in the secret archive. he then informed the assembly that iran also has a second secret facility in tehran — an atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and material from iran’s secret nuclear weapons program. displaying a photo of the site, he described it as an innocent‑looking compound on maher alley, near a rug‑cleaning operation. when south africa and libya gave up their nuclear programs, they destroyed the archives, material and

iranian people around the regime. although the people are definitely rallying, it is against the regime, with chants of “death to the dictator”, he said. he expressed israel’s appreciation to president trump and ambassador nikki haley for their unwavering support for israel at the united nations, including israel’s right to defend itself. the united states has also backed out of a history‑denying united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco) and a morally bankrupt human rights council. it stopped funding an unreformed united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east (unrwa) that instead of solving the palestinian refugee problem, perpetuates it. president trump stood up to what has long been a speciality at the united nations: slandering israel. recalling the united nations resolution comparing zionism to racism had been repealed long ago, he said that opinion still lingers at the organization. israel is accused of racism, yet its arab citizens have the same individual rights as all other israeli citizens. israel is also accused of apartheid. “this is the same old anti-semitism with a brand-new face,” he underscored. president abbas said that israel’s new nation-state law proves that israel is a racist apartheid state, he continued. yet, mr. abbas’s dissertation denied the holocaust and palestinian

Italy,"draft italy general debate of the seventy-third session of the general assembly of the united nations statement his excellency the president of the council of ministers prof. giuseppe conte (new york, 26 september 2018) () draft madam president, mr. secretary-general, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, i am honored to take the floor today before this assembly as the spokesman of the will of the italian government and people to confirm our commitment alongside and in favor of the united nations. in a global context that is increasingly fragmented, multipolar, and in constant evolution, we are convinced, in fact, that the international community needs more effective multilateralism and a united nations that is strengthened in its role as a pillar of an international system based on peace, justice and equity. we therefore continue to support the reform plan of the secretary-general even more today, in the delicate implementation process that awaits him. we want a united nations that is closer to the people, able to respond to their needs for security and well-being, and ready to protect them from the pitfalls of globalization, which offers many opportunities but can also produce errant effects. the italian government has placed these same priorities at the basis of its action. government action that does not give due consideration to assuring that all of its citizens have equitable and fiilly dignified living conditions is not action that i can consider morally, much less politically acceptable. draft when some accuse us of souverainism or populism, i always enjoy pointing out that article 1 of the italian constitution cites sovereignty and the people, and it is precisely through that provision that i interpret the concept of sovereignty and the exercise of sovereignty by the people. this approach does not modify the traditional position of italy within the international community and consequently toward the united nations. security, the defense of peace and the values that best preserve it, and the promotion of development and human rights are goals that we share and shall continue to pursue with courage and conviction at the national and international levels. on the 70* anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, italy is expressing this will through is candidature to the human rights council. respect for the inviolable rights of man is one of the pillars on which the italian republic is founded, our beacon, especially today, when we are called upon to address the immense challenges of the grave and prolonged crises in the euromediterranean area, including migratory flows. for years italy has been engaged in search and rescue missions in the mediterranean sea, and has saved from death tens of thousands of people, often single-handedly, as has frequently been acknowledged by those who say that italy has ""saved the honor of europe."" the migratory phenomena we are facing require a structured, multilevel, and short-, medium-, and long-term response from the international community as a whole. it is on this basis that we support the global compact on migration and refugees. draft this is a challenge that can and must be met through a ""shared responsibility"" approach, in a logic of partnership between the countries of origin, transit, and destination of the flows, taking into account the priority need to guarantee the dignity of the individual but also the firm determination to fight those who trample on this dignity and on life itself through human trafficking. madam president, distinguished delegates, italy pursues the goals of international peace and security, also during times of budgetary constraints. we are solidly in eighth position as a contributor to the united nations' regular budget, and we supplement this commitment through development initiatives both at the bilateral level and through the united nations agencies. these initiatives are inspired by the sustainable development goals inscribed in agenda 2030. poverty, inequalities, unemployment, and the devastating effects of climate change are ills that concern every country, independently of their level of development. the logic of assistance must give way to a framework of mutual responsibility and partnership, such as what italy is promoting, for example, on the african continent, so that each stakeholder can do his part to the best of his possibilities and abilities. italy is proud to be one of the main contributors to peacekeeping operations. this is a commitment we have maintained for many years now, and for which we have received the appreciation, essential to us, first and foremost of the local communities in which we are operating. draft italy is a country whose dna contains the promotion of dialog and inclusiveness in crisis situations. these principles are essential when addressing the grave and widespread situations of instability that today characterize an area that is vital to the security and prosperity of italy and europe as a whole, namely the greater mediterranean. in the upcoming weeks italy will host a conference on libya whose main goal is to support the shared political path and contribute to the political stabilization of the country. this path will foster the broadest possible involvement of the libyan stakeholders, who remain the master of their destiny. the united nations will play a central role through the action plan, on which all the contributions of the main international and regional stakeholders will converge. the long conflict that for seven years has roiled syria demonstrates all the limits of military solutions. we have the duty to support the action of the un and of special envoy de mistura. madam president, distinguished delegates, shared responsibility, in the framework of building peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, is a call that we share and accept as an invitation to change: the same spirit of change that characterizes the action of the government that i lead. draft but we must also assume this responsibility toward the reform of the united nations security council, on which italy will continue to pursue its deep commitment, in dialog with all member states, to achieve the goal of a shared reform. the path to effective multilateralism, to which we all should aspire, cannot disregard, in fact, the need for every member of the human family to recognize in the united nations a true global leadership to which they look with renewed faith. thank you.","giuseppe conte, president of the council of ministers of italy, said that, in a global context which is increasingly fragmented, multipolar and in constant evolution, the international

stabilization of the country. this path will foster the broadest‑possible involvement of the libyan stakeholders who remain the master of their destiny. the united nations will play a central role through the action plan on which all the contributions of the main and regional stakeholders will converge. shared responsibility in the framework of building peaceful and sustainable societies is a call that is shared. that responsibility should be assumed towards the reform of the united nations security council, on which italy will continue to pursue its deep commitment, in dialog with all member states, to achieve the goal of a shared reform."
Jamaica,"permanent mission of jamaica to the united nations statement by the most honorable andrew holness, on, mp prime minister general debate 73rd session of the united nations general assembly new york - 27th september 2018 theme: “building societies, securing the future” madam president, i warmly congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the 73rd session of the general assembly. of the four women who have served as president, you are the first from latin america and the caribbean. jamaica is especially pleased that this honor has been conferred upon such an eminent appointee from our region. we also share your desire to see greater gender balance in the presidency of the general assembly in the years ahead. madam president, you can be assured of jamaica’s full support during your tenure. your chosen theme for this 73rd session resonates well with us. it is imperative that we make the united nations relevant to all people through global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. this year marks ten years since the global economic and financial crisis manifested itself in 2008. we are greatly encouraged, by reports from international development partners that global growth has improved, and unemployment has declined to its lowest since the crisis. we are however, mindful that among developing economies, including small island developing states such as mine, growth prospects are becoming more uneven. we remain vulnerable to a gamut of social, economic, environmental, financial and trade-related hazards, from within and beyond our borders. in that context, jamaica’s quest to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth and meaningful job creation has encountered challenges. ten years on, we still face the vagaries of an uncertain and at times volatile global economic environment. together with persistent challenges linked to climate change and more frequent intense weather events; these all impact the pace of our development. 1 notwithstanding the multiple challenges that confront us individually or collectively, jamaica is developing the social and political consensus to pursue policies which will secure our economic independence. in the last decade, we have: ● ● ● ● engaged in deep structural reform of our economy; reduced our debt profile from being one of the highest in the world; transformed our energy sector; increased our social support for the most vulnerable. and what has been the result of this? our sovereign ratings and outlook have moved from negative to positive. we cannot wait on the world to save us, and we recognize that the world will not wait for us. notwithstanding that we are a small island developing state with numerous challenges - we are taking our destiny into our own hands. ultimately, we believe our economic independence will secure our resilience. nevertheless, we continue to strengthen traditional partnerships and build new ones with like-minded countries around the world, that see the global benefits in countries big and small, rich and poor, working together to solve issues too big for any of us to solve alone. this year, jamaica was pleased to have been invited to represent caricom at outreach sessions of the g7 and the brics summits. we have also been representing caricom throughout the year at meetings of the g20 under the argentine presidency. those fora represent extremely influential groupings of countries, jamaica believes that groupings like these, have a unique opportunity, working alongside the international development partners, to address the problems that face weaker economies across the globe. jamaica therefore, welcomes the opportunity to share perspectives with our strong economic partners, to ensure they gain an understanding of the risks 2 that we face in our region of small developing states, most of which are island states. jamaica stands ready to continue working on how we can transform global thinking, and together find effective solutions within a fair, rules-based multilateral system, supportive of policies which will ensure the emergence and empowerment of small and developing states - truly leaving no country, and no one behind. our concerted action must embody: ● effective strategies to bolster the global financial system; ● a robust global campaign to identify funding for the implementation of agenda 2030 and; ● resilience and adaptation measures to address the devastating effects of climate change and natural disasters. jamaica and our caricom brother and sister islands do not have the luxury of engaging in a philosophical debate on whether or not climate change is real. the issue is existential for us. major storms are no longer uncommon. they have given way to super storms. they are stronger and more frequent. every year, the caribbean region, leading right up to the south-eastern coast of the united states of america, live in fear for 5 months. 5 months of hoping that the devastation that was wreaked on north carolina, on antigua and barbuda, on texas, on grenada, on jamaica, are not visited upon them this year. have you seen what happened to dominica? the disaster wreaked by these super storms is the closest thing that we can imagine/compare to a nuclear event. after 4 hours of one hurricane, dominica lost 226% of their gdp - they are still recovering. as the secretary-general’s report confirms, we witnessed, last year, the costliest north atlantic hurricane season – with losses estimated at 229 billion 3 united states dollars. furthermore, the economic cost of climate related disasters globally, was 320 billion united states dollars. madam president, with special reference to the issue of climate change, i was particularly honored by the invitation of secretary general guterres to join him and president macron of france, in leading a special initiative to mobilize funds committed at the copenhagen conference in 2009 in the amount of us$100 billion per year up to 2020. we are only two years away from the deadline, but as at today, we are nowhere near the target amount. we must therefore galvanize an effective global fundraising campaign. against this background, my delegation looks forward to the climate change summit to be convened by the secretary-general in 2019. more specifically, i also commit personally to work assiduously towards increasing the momentum to secure the promised resources to address climate-related issues that affect us all. madam president, many of the structural factors that impede our ability to narrow the persistent income gap between developing and advanced economies, can be addressed by the successful implementation of agenda 2030 and its 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs). global estimates of the scale of the sdgs financing gap, range from 5 to 7 trillion us dollars per annum. meaningful progress in this regard will require that we tap into various sources of funding. i cannot overstate the importance of including innovative ways of mobilizing private sector financing. in addition, several small island developing states (sids), like jamaica, are deemed to have ‘graduated’ to middle income status primarily by virtue of their gdp per-capita. many of them however, are highly indebted and vulnerable. high debt ratios constrain the ability to secure domestic fiscal resources at a reasonable cost, for implementation of national development goals. the reality 4 is that, even though many have made advances in reducing levels of extreme poverty, several of our broader development gains have stalled. we therefore, highly commend the work undertaken by eclac, which affirms the importance of complementing the per-capita income criterion, by addressing structural gaps that retard development prospects for middleincome countries. accordingly, i am reiterating my call for the international financial institutions to address this persistent problem known as the middle-income trap. we believe that a special highly indebted middle-income initiative could provide the framework for the type of support that these countries require. it is our greatest hope that the un high-level middle income countries meeting, scheduled for later this year, will give the fullest consideration to these matters, and ways in which the un system can provide support. in the interim, jamaica continues to work with partners like canada, to provide a platform whereby countries can engage directly with actors in the private sector, development finance institutions and regulators. our goal is to forge collaborative partnerships between un member states and the private sector to determine practical, solution-oriented ways of securing new and long-term capital investment, utilizing a mix of public, private and blended financing to implement the sdgs. even as we diligently seek financing for sustainable development, we are ever mindful that we live in a world where international peace and security are under continuous threat. the world has witnessed several terrorist attacks and grapples with a range of conflicts that appear intractable. the secretary general has therefore appropriately placed emphasis on conflict prevention, as well as on promoting a new disarmament agenda. as he has often stated, we must confront issues concerning peace and security along a peace continuum: “from prevention, conflict resolution and peacekeeping, to peacebuilding and sustainable long-term development”. 5 jamaica is especially interested in the efforts to build a secure environment through combating the illicit traffic and trade in small arms and light weapons. we have made significant national institutional changes, undertaken policy enhancements and adopted legislative amendments in the areas of security and justice. we now look forward to working with other member states, the un system and partners at all levels to ensure that the progress we have made, is sustainable. madam president, societies function best within an inclusive global environment, where no one feels left behind. implementation of the sdgs must be people-centered. embargoes and other financial and economic barriers must not become tools to prevent people, such as our neighbors, the citizens the republic of cuba, from attaining their right to development. jamaica continues to call for a lifting of the embargoes against that country. we also believe it is important to support the efforts of the secretary general and his special envoys in pursuing political processes related to situations in the western sahara, syria and myanmar. as we prepare to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, let us continue to be mindful of the many amongst us who consistently face discrimination of various forms. jamaica has been at the forefront of international human rights, having been the first country to incorporate human rights into our foreign policy strategy – a principle that we guard fiercely. we will never lose sight of the responsibility to promote and protect the interests of the vulnerable. we are especially keen to ensure that our women, children, persons living with disabilities, elderly and young people can make 6 meaningful contributions, and reap, the benefits of a safe and prosperous society. madam president, jamaica will shortly assume membership of the ecosoc currently chaired by st vincent and the grenadines. our term of office will coincide with what promises to be a momentous year for that un body. we are committed to advancing the work of the council, including during its high-level political forum. madam president, societies are not sustainable without healthy citizens. as a region that is severely impacted by non-communicable diseases, we in the caribbean are actively promoting and implementing measures to reverse this trend by encouraging health and wellness. i was truly energized as i joined my caricom colleagues this morning in launching ‘caribbean moves’ – a region-wide initiative aimed at raising awareness and increasing physical activity among our people - the young and not so young. we look forward to building on the outcomes of the high-level meeting that has been convened this week on ncds. jamaica will also support ongoing actions to combat tuberculosis as well as to promote universal health coverage. madam president, you have challenged us to ensure that the un remains a beacon of hope for each citizen across the globe. to that end, the un must be responsive to an ever-changing and unpredictable world, if it is to remain relevant and effective. 7 the secretary-general is correct in stating that: ""one of the most valuable assets of the united nations is its capacity to operate as a convener of people, a proponent of ideas, a catalyst for action and a driver of solutions."" for this reason, we remain steadfast in our support of efforts towards un reform. we commend the secretary general’s actions in pressing for reform of the peace and security architecture; the un development system; and its management and operational structure. of course, we are ever mindful of the words of our recently departed secretary general, kofi annan, a stalwart of multilateral diplomacy, that “no reform of the un will be complete without reform of the security council”. madam president, our global alliance comprises 193 sovereign states, but there is no denying the fact that we are all interdependent. a joint and multi-faceted response is required to surmount the myriad hurdles ahead of us, for it is only through collaboration that we can “build our societies and secure our common future”. our legacy must be one that uplifts and inspires. let this therefore, be our mandate for this 73rd session of our general assembly. i thank you. 8","andrew holness, prime minister of jamaica, said it is imperative to make the united nations relevant to all people. since the global economic crisis 10 years ago, global growth has improved and unemployment has declined. but small developing economies have enjoyed a more uneven growth. jamaica’s own quest for inclusive and economic growth has encountered challenges, including those linked to climate change and intense weather events. regardless of the difficulties, his country is pursuing policies that will secure economic growth such as structural reform of its economy, reduction of its debt profile, transformation of the energy sector and increased social support for the vulnerable population. ultimately, economic independence will secure jamaica’s resilience. jamaica continues to strengthen traditional partnerships and build new ones, he noted, including the invitation to represent the caribbean community (caricom) at outreach summits of the group of seven (g7) and brics (brazil, russian federation, india, china and south africa). influential country alliances have the opportunity to work alongside international development partners to address problems that face weaker economies. concerted action will be required to find effective solutions within a fair, multilateral system. jamaica and its caricom partners do not have the luxury of engaging in a philosophical debate on climate change, he went on to say. for five months every year, the caribbean region lives in fear of super storms. the hurricane devastation wreaked on dominica could be compared to a nuclear event. the global cost of climate-related disasters was $320 billion last year. against that background, his country looks forward to the climate change summit to be convened by the secretary-general in 2019, he said. to achieve the sustainable development goals, various sources of additional funding must be tapped, he said, highlighting the importance of mobilizing private sector funding. many small island developing states are deemed to have graduated to middle‑income status based on their gross domestic product (gdp). yet many remain highly indebted and vulnerable. he commended the work of the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean (eclac) and called for international financial institutions to address the problem known as the “middle‑income countries”. his government will continue to work with partners such as canada to provide a platform where countries can engage directly with actors in the private sector. jamaica is especially committed to combating the illicit traffic and trade of small arms and light weapons and has made significant national institutional changes and policy enhancements in that effort, he continued. implementation of the sustainable development goals must be people‑centered and embargoes and financial barriers must not become tools to prevent people from their right to development. societies are not sustainable without healthy citizens, he said, pointing out that jamaica is severely impacted by non‑communicable diseases but is implementing measures to reverse that trend."
Japan,"address by h.e. mr. shinzo abe, prime minister of japan, at the seventy-third session of the united nations general assembly september 25, 2018 [provisional translation] serving as a flag bearer for free trade clearing away northeast asia’s postwar structure promoting the “free and open indo-pacific strategy” inviting teachers from gaza japan and the japanese looking intently at the future mr. chairman, ladies and gentlemen, i have been accorded the privilege of continuing to serve as japan’s helmsman for the next three years. as i address the general assembly today for the sixth consecutive year, i do so with a feeling of renewed resolve. in the three years to come, i will do my very best to strengthen the free trade system. i will likewise do everything in my power to clear the postwar structure from northeast asia. serving as a flag bearer for free trade in my view, the japanese people have eagerly hoped for their national leaders to serve as flag bearers for free trade. this is because after the war, japan itself was a nation that enjoyed remarkable growth, basking 1/9 in the advantages of trade as the beneficiary of a free and open economic system. the free trade system enabled the countries of asia, one after the other, to achieve take-off and fostered the middle class in each of these countries. in the background was the large-scale direct investment japan has made in these countries since the 1980s. in all these cases, this was possible thanks to the international economic system being rules-based, free, and open. should japan, the country that reaped the greatest benefits of all under this system, ever fail to support maintaining and strengthening that system, who else should we wait for to rise in support of it? japan’s responsibility is tremendous indeed. that is also japan’s mission, rooted in its own history. other than coal that supported modern japan’s industrialization, our nation has had no other resources to speak of. but upon devoting itself to reaping the blessings of trade, post-war japan succeeded in realizing growth that was called a miracle, even though it lacked resources. the very first country to prove through its own experience the principle that exists between trade and growth -- a principle that has now become common sense -- was japan. japan has now taken on the mission of imparting to the world the benefits of trade. i have at times risen above intense debates domestically, waving the flag of free trade. there has been no greater joy for me than when tpp11, took final shape and was quickly approved by our diet. in addition, japan and the european union have signed an economic 2/9 partnership agreement that is of a scale and scope worthy of special mention in world history. but that said, we must not be complacent. i must drive my efforts up a notch, aiming still farther into the distance. in addition to japan’s commitment to the world trade organization, which is a given, i will make all-out efforts towards negotiations on the “rcep,” which will give rise to an enormous free-trade area in east asia. and, more than anything else, i value our new trade talks with the united states, dubbed the “ffr” trade talks. for many a year, both japan and the united states have led the free trade system forward internationally. as evidence of that, japan’s direct investment has created employment in the u.s. for some 856,000 people nationwide, a quantity second only to what the u.k. has brought about. at present, in contrast to the 1.74 million vehicles exported annually from japan to the united states, the number of japanese cars manufactured within the united states is 3.77 million. this is a win-win situation at its finest. i intend for japan and the united states to continue this kind of relationship between us. but this is hardly unique to our bilateral ties with the u.s. under the flag of free trade, japan has with any country and any region built up relations in which we each can be of assistance to the other. we will continue to do this going forward. 3/9 in order to expand free and fair economic rules befitting to the 21st century into the vast region extending from asia and the pacific to the indian ocean, the countries that have created the system and reaped the greatest benefits from that system -- that is to say, countries like japan -- must lead the effort. this is what i believe. clearing away northeast asia’s postwar structure just a few moments ago i stated that i will do everything in my power to clear the long-standing postwar structure from northeast asia. i am now, together with president vladimir putin, working to get the deadlock between our countries that has seen no movement for more than 70 years back into motion again. president putin and i met at the beginning of this month in vladivostok. this was our 22nd summit meeting. i will meet him again in the near future. we must resolve the territorial issue that lies between japan and russia and conclude a peace treaty between our two countries. once a japan-russia peace treaty comes into existence, the peace and prosperity of east asia will attain a more certain cornerstone. ladies and gentlemen, from this very location at this time last year, i strongly urged north korea to resolve its abductions, nuclear, and missile issues. as someone who appealed for the full implementation of all relevant un security council resolutions, i pay the greatest interest in changes of north korea. north korea is now at a crossroads at which it will either seize, or fail to seize, the historic opportunity it was afforded. north korea has both 4/9 untapped natural resources and a labor force whose productivity can be greatly enhanced. japan’s policy of seeking to settle the unfortunate past and normalize its relations with north korea once the abductions, nuclear, and missile issues are resolved will not change. we will be unstinting in our assistance to unleash the potential north korea holds. however, i must reiterate one thing time and time again. we will bring about the return of all japanese abductees. i am determined to make this a reality. in order to resolve the abductions issue, i am also ready to break the shell of mutual distrust with north korea, get off to a new start, and meet face to face with chairman kim jong-un. at present, nothing has been decided regarding a japan-north korea summit meeting, but if we are going to hold one, then i am determined it must be a meeting that contributes to the resolution of the abductions issue. i wish to comment briefly on japan-china relations as well. the mutual visits at the leaders’ level that began this year will continue, with me visiting china next month, to be followed by my inviting president xi jinping to japan, thereby adding to our bilateral relations and to the entire region another definitive axle for stability. promoting the “free and open indo-pacific strategy” when the confrontational structure is cleared out of northeast asia, the maritime corridor running from the arctic ocean to the sea of 5/9 japan, through the pacific ocean to the indian ocean will become increasingly important. japan, located directly above it and also possessing a vast exclusive economic zone, or “eez,” hopes for stability and peace in these waters as well as in the airspaces above them. the countries of asean lie at the “confluence of the two seas” -- the pacific and indian oceans. and it was the forerunners living in what we now call the pacific island countries who in eras long past crossed these two oceans to introduce products to faraway eastern africa. what i call the “free and open indo-pacific strategy” derives from our desire to preserve the blessings of open seas, together with these very countries, as well as the united states, australia, india, and others, and indeed, all countries and peoples who share the same intent. what must control our sea and air spaces that are broad and wide is the rule of law, and the rules-based order, which are in turn backed by solid institutions. hence my strategy. the other day, foreign students in japan proudly returned to their home countries of malaysia, the philippines, and sri lanka with new academic degrees in hand. these degrees were master’s degrees that can only be obtained in japan. they are master’s degrees in maritime safety and security policy. in addition to the students the japan coast guard sends to the program were senior officials from various coast guard authorities in countries all around asia. the students who graduated the other day were in the third cohort of students to enter the program. 6/9 maritime order is not a matter of power, but a matter of the rule of law and one that is rules-based. every year a class learning such an everlasting truth and taking it as a guiding principle for their lives will head out from japan to the seas. this is very promising indeed. cultivating those who will protect and defend a free and open indopacific is, precisely, japan’s noble mission. inviting teachers from gaza ladies and gentlemen, as i was preparing this address, i created a new but modest program. at the beginning of 2019, we will invite to japan approximately ten elementary and junior high school teachers from the gaza strip. this will be the first such group and we will continue to invite teachers annually. teachers who find themselves in japan, a place so different for them both culturally and historically, will naturally put the situation in gaza and the middle east into a wider perspective, enabling them to see their own hometowns and region anew. such an experience should somehow work in a unique way as a solace to them. it goes without saying that for peace, efforts must be made on both sides. but hopefully this program of ours will impart a means of hope to the teachers from gaza and the children in their care. once 20 years pass, there will be 200 teachers who will have experienced visiting japan. the number of students taught by them will number in the thousands. i look forward to that day. 7/9 japan and the japanese looking intently at the future the goal of japanese diplomacy, which i conveyed to you to some extent today, is to make the future of the world and the region something that is certain. in addition, what i wish is for the young people who will live in the japan of the future to vigorously take on challenges. the duty of our generation is to create an environment that facilitates this. it is as if a new breeze is now about to blow in japan. from the end of april next year into the beginning of may, his majesty the emperor will abdicate and his imperial highness the crown prince will accede to the imperial throne. in fact this is the first imperial succession in 200 years to accompany the abdication of the current emperor. in october we will welcome guests of honor from around the world who will come to extend their good wishes. next june, japan will host the g20 summit. as the chair of the meeting, i intend to lead the discussions about issues facing the international community, including the state of the global economy and environmental issues. soon after, in august, japan will host the tokyo international conference on african development, or “ticad.” this will be the seventh time to hold this summit, which japan has continued to hold with great care since 1993 and which has earned unwavering trust from national leaders all across africa. for example we will discuss 8/9 with each other “universal health coverage,” whose importance i have highlighted a number of times. and lest we forget, next year japan hosts the rugby world cup, and in 2020, tokyo hosts the olympic and paralympic games. our eyes will continue to be fixed on the future. when japan and the japanese people fix their gaze squarely on the future, japan increases in vitality. japanese looking intently at the future will become people who determinedly take on responsibility for achieving the sdgs. such next-generation japanese youth will work commendably as flag bearers for the “un spirit.” i am absolutely certain of that. in closing, i will state that in light of the lack of progress in reforming the security council, the significance of the united nations in the 21st century world is already being starkly questioned. but that is precisely why japan will never let up in its contributions to the united nations. i will end my address with a pledge that japan, together with secretary-general guterres, will push forward with the reform of the security council and the reform of the united nations. thank you very much. 9/9","shinzō abe, prime minister of japan, pledging to do his utmost to strengthen a free-trade system and clear the post-war structure from north-east asia, highlighted the remarkable growth his own country has enjoyed. indeed, the free-trade system has enabled many asian countries to foster a middle-class because of a rules-based, free and open international economic system. japan has now taken on a mission of imparting to the world the benefits of trade, he said, underlining achievements such as a european union partnership agreement, a commitment to the wto and new trade talks with the united states. sharing examples of the latter, he noted that japan’s direct investment has created 856,000 jobs in the united states. japan also stands ready to work with other nations and regions, he continued, spotlighting talks with the president of the russian federation to overcome a 70-year-old deadlock between the two countries. upon the conclusion of a japanese-russian peace treaty, the peace and prosperity of east asia will be strengthened, he added. recalling that one year ago he had, before the general assembly, urged the democratic people’s republic of korea to resolve its abductions, nuclear and missile issues, he said now the country is at a crossroads. the democratic people’s republic of korea has both untapped natural resources and a labor force whose productivity can be greatly enhanced, he said, adding that “we will be unstinting in our assistance to unleash the potential” the country holds and will also bring about the return of all japanese abductees. to resolve the abductions issue, he will “break the shell of mutual distrust” with pyongyang and “get off to a new start”, meeting face to face with chairman kim jong-un, he said, noting that no date for a summit has been set yet. turning to other developments in the region, he said mutual japan-china visits at the leaders’ level began in 2018 and will continue, providing a point of stability for the region. when the confrontational structure is cleared out of north-east asia, the maritime corridor running from the arctic ocean to the sea of japan through the pacific ocean to the indian ocean will become increasingly important. expressing hope for stability and peace in those areas through the rule of law and a rules-based order backed by solid institutions, he said those principles are the basis of a free and open indo-pacific strategy. turning to other plans, he said the government will launch a program that will bring teachers from gaza to japan. in addition, japan will host in 2019 the group of 20 summit, the tokyo international conference on african development and the rugby world cup. when japan and its people fix their gaze on the future, the country increases in vitality, he said, noting that new generations will work as flag bearers for the united nations spirit. however, citing the lack of progress on security council reform, he said the organization’s significance in the twenty-first century world is already being questioned. as such, he will work with the secretary-general to push forward reform of the council and of the united nations."
Jordan,"remarks by his majesty king abdullah ii plenary session 73rd united nations general assembly 25 september 2018 in the name of god, the merciful, the compassionate, madam president, mr. secretary general, your excellencies, thank you. it is an honor to take part, once again, in this great general assembly. the united nations was bom in the ashes of the second world war, out of a deep desire to protect new generations from suffering, destmction, and want. today, these hopes still face challenges; peace and stability have met threats in every region; too many people remain excluded from the promise of prosperity, and global terror continues to target all nations. here in this chamber, eve called it a third world war. my friends, these challenges do not make collective action and mutual respect less important. they make our partnership more important. because what is the alte ative? a world without the peace and accord we need to work together, trade together, expand opportunity together? a world where crises are not resolved, but magnified? violence spreads, more refugees flee, because we can't work together to help people stay safe and thrive? we have a long way to go to deliver global opportunity and hope, but we can t simply give up because the task is hard. all our countries benefit when we unite in common cause. i am compelled to talk about this today because of the critical role of collective action in ending the serious crises in my region, and especially the key crisis the long denial of a palestinian state. every un resolution since the beginning of this crisis every resolution, whether from the general assembly or the security council recognizes the i equal rights of the palestinian people to a future of peace, dignity, and hope. this is the heart of the two-state settlement, the only pat to a comprehensive, lasting peace. only a two-state solution based on international law and relevant un resolutions can meet the needs of both sides: an end to conflict, a viable, independent, sovereign palestinian state on the 1967 borders with east jerusalem as its capital, and a secure israel, fully part of its own region, recognized by arab and muslim states around the world. arab and muslim countries are committed to a comprehensive peace; the arab peace initiative has been on offer for more than 16 years. indeed, every major country in the world, the un, the european union, all have worked to help the parties reach a durable peace that can last. the us administration has long been committed to peace, and has a leading role in our progress going forward. yes, we have a long way to go, but we can t give up because the task is hard. because, what is the alternative? can we afford to let one of the world’s most strategic regions be tied to an endless cycle of violence in its midst? how long must jerusalem, a holy city to more than half the world’s people, face dangers to its multi-faith heritage and identity? how can we accept a status quo of continuing crisis and bigotry? palestinian families displaced for generations, their children’s very identity denied. israeli families, living in continuing national self-isolation; without the security of peaceful relationships worldwide. and what could possibly be the f ture of what some propose: a single, bi¬ national state, whose very foundation is a rejection of the equality of its own people? that’s the ugly, undemocratic reality of the one-state idea. it is by no means an alternative to a two-state peace settlement, it is an abandonment of peace, a new way to go awol from the work of reconciliation, and the opposite of what both sides need, and have sought for so long. my friends, there is no such thing as a unilateral agreement; it takes at least two parties to make an agreement. helping the parties achieve that agreement, and work together to build a new future, deserves the strong, steady support of all our world. 2 our countries need to pull together to get this peace process back on track. that means utterly rejecting actions that jeopardize negotiations, whether by illegal encroachments, land confiscations, or threats to the welfare of innocents, especially children. we need to support full funding of unrwa and other vital efforts to protect families, keep communities stable, and prepare young people for productive lives. it would be a terrible mistake to abandon youth to the forces of radicalism and despair. such support is urgently needed to ensure unrwa fulfills its role, in accord with its un mandate. above all, we need to safeguard the heritage an peace of jerusalem, a holy city to billions of people around the world. the hashemite custodianship of islamic and christian holy sites in jerusalem is a duty that jordan is proud to carry, and we will counter any attempts to change the holy city s historic arab christian and muslim identity. but jerusalem’s future is not jordan’s concern alone; it is yours. there are global implications when religious worship is threatened and international law is undermined. my friends, collective action is also vital when it comes to resolving other conflicts and crises that threaten our world. jordan will continue to support all multilateral efforts to help syria achieve a political solution, based on the geneva process, and un security council resolution 2254, to safeguard the country’s unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and create the conditions for stability and rebuilding. an effective global response to terror also requires continued collective action. let’s be clear about it: for all our victories, the fight against these outlaws, the khawarej of islam, is not over. winning the war demands a long¬ term, holistic approach, one that pairs security measures with strong initiatives that support inclusion and hope. online and offline, we must counter all i say all ideologies of hatred, including islamophobia. jordanians have led efforts to unite the world in mutual respect and understanding. 3 finally, we must also strengthen our collective response to the global refugee crisis. as many of you know, jordan has carried a massive, disproportionate burden as a refugee host. our people have opened their homes, schools, public services, hospitals. we have shared our country s scarce resources, our food and energy, our precious water. the crisis has held back economic growth and job creation, jobs urgently nee ed by our young people, more than 60 percent of our population. jordanians have borne this refugee burden in full accord with our country s long humanitarian traditions, but we know, and the world knows, that this crisis is a global responsibility. the sacrifices we and other host countries make every day can only continue if donor nations hold up their side of the partnership. that means continued, multi-track efforts in development support and humanitarian assistance; efforts which not only prepare refugees to retu home and rebuild their countries, but also give hope to the people of host countries, who have sacrificed so much. my friends, the world cannot address the refugee crisis, or any global crisis, unless we work together to support those who are doing the right thing for the future we all share. peace and prosperity demand constant, collecti e action. the alternative is to fail our history, and fail our future. let us choose, instead, to succeed, to give the world’s people, especially young people, confidence in global justice, hope for new opportunity, and international laws and agreements and institutions that everyone can rely on. thank you. m 4","abdullah ii ibn al hussein, king of jordan, stressed the importance of collective action in ending the serious crises in the middle east, especially the long denial of a palestinian state. the palestinian people have equal rights to a future of peace, dignity and hope. only a two‑state solution based on international law and relevant united nations resolutions can meet the needs of both sides: a viable, independent, sovereign palestinian state on the 1967 borders with east jerusalem as its capital, and a secure israel, fully part of its own region, recognized by arab and muslim states around the world. describing a one-state solution as “ugly and undemocratic,” he said, “it is by no means an alternative to a two‑state peace settlement”. rejecting unilateral measures, he stressed the need to fully fund the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east (unrwa) and other vital efforts in support of families and young people. “it would be a terrible mistake to abandon youth to the forces of radicalism and despair,” he said. turning to the need to safeguard the heritage and peace of jerusalem, he noted that jordan carries out a duty as the hashemite custodianship of islamic and christian holy sites in jerusalem. jordan will also continue to support all multilateral efforts to help syria achieve a political solution, based on the geneva process, and united nations security council resolution 2254 (2015), he said. an effective global response to terror also requires continued collective action, which pairs security measures with strong initiatives to support inclusion and hope. there is a need, online or offline, to counter ideologies of hatred, including islamophobia. jordanians have led efforts to unite the world in mutual respect and understanding. on the global refugee crisis, he said that his country has carried a “massive, disproportionate” burden as a host. “our people have opened their homes, schools, public services, and hospitals. we have shared our country’s scarce resources, our food and energy, our precious water,” he reported. this has held back economic growth and job creation. while jordanians have borne the refugee burden in full accord with their long humanitarian traditions, he stressed that burden is a shared global responsibility. “the world cannot address the refugee crisis, or any global crisis, unless we work tougher to support those who are doing the right thing for the future we all share,” he stated. peace and prosperity demand constant and collective action. he called for all member states to give the world’s people, especially youth, confidence in global justice, hope for new opportunities and international laws, and agreements that everyone can rely on."
Kazakhstan,"statement by h.e. mr. kairat abdrakhmanov, minister of foreign affairs of the republic of kazakhstan the high-level general debate of the 73rd session of the unga “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” new york, 28 september 2018 madam/mr. president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, as we commemorate this year, the 100th anniversary of the birth of one of the greatest sons of humanity – nelson mandela – i would like to begin my statement with his quote: “it is easy to break down and destroy. the heroes are those who make peace and build.” madam/mr. president, we have approached the 73rd session of the general assembly with a grown number of problems vis-à-vis last year, facing a lack of trust and mutual respect. we find ourselves in a state of a profound world-wide crisis that touches every aspect of the life of each and every person in our interconnected and rapidly accelerating world. millions of people live under a shadow of dreadful wars, such as in syria, yemen and many other corners of the globe. kazakhstan believes that war can never be a lasting solution to any problem. based on this conviction and sharing the belief that the only viable solution to the current crisis in syria is the inclusive and syrian-led political process, we launched the astana process towards strengthening confidencebuilding measures between the conflicting parties in syria. our far-reaching commitment is embodied in the 2016 anti-war manifesto “the world. 21st century”, by kazakhstan’s president nursultan nazarbayev, who stated in that treatise: “the main tool for resolving all disputes between states should be a peaceful dialog and constructive negotiations on the basis of equal responsibility for peace and security, mutual respect and non-interference into domestic affairs.” it is a roadmap for peace, calling for the efficient use of all tools available – from early warning, conflict prevention, diplomacy and mediation, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, to sustainable development. !2 ladies and gentlemen, my country has become a net contributor to peace, security and stability, economic and social development - not only in our region, but far beyond. we have carefully preserved peace and harmony in our multi-ethnic and multi-religious society, stressing and enforcing the equality and dignity of every citizen. we have achieved this while also creating an efficient economic model – our economy has grown more than 20 times from the day my country emerged as an independent state. looking forward, kazakhstan has a clear vision for its future development. by 2050 we seek to become one of the top thirty most advanced economies in the world, meeting the highest global standards in terms of economic performance and transparent governance, especially those of the oecd. as a new model of economic growth, president nazarbayev in his annual address earlier this year announced the new opportunities under the fourth industrial revolution. it outlines the path for our country to achieve those ambitious goals. this new road map focuses on industrialisation, further development of our resource potential, the use of smart technologies as a chance for a breakthrough in the development of the agricultural industry, increasing the efficiency of transport and logistics infrastructure, “reloading” the financial sector and the strengthening of human capital as the basis of modernisation. on a global level president nazarbayev has put forward the g-global initiative – a communication and it platform to ensure wide and inclusive dialog on finding common solution for global economic and financial shortcomings. the platform unites prominent international scientists, entrepreneurs, politicians. madam/mr. president, in the regional context we are committed to further extending our partnership among central asian countries and to enhancing our common capability to withstand threats and challenges. today in central asia, a ""new reality"" has been formed. we consider the political, economic and cultural potential of the region as a common resource, the most rational and effective use of which is achievable only in a collective format. our shared goal is creating in our region of central asia and beyond a model for a zone of peace, security, trust, development and cooperation. several features of such a zone are already in place, as exemplified by the council of the turkic speaking states, the international aral sea fund and !3 its last summit, that demonstrated strong political collaboration amongst regional leaders, the nuclear weapons free zone in central asia and other mechanisms. being the first country from the region represented in the un security council, we try to deeper focus to the situation in afghanistan with its full implications and threats in the broader regional context. besides, kazakhstan for many years has been contributing significantly to peace and rehabilitation of this country. we believe that the revival of the country as a prosperous and peaceful neighbor will have a positive impact on overall security in our region. a special role in this process should be played by afghan women. to increase international awareness and support for the needs of afghan women and girls, we hosted the regional conference on empowering women in afghanistan on september 5, 2018 in astana. it was attended by female politicians, parliamentarians, entrepreneurs and civil sector members from afghanistan and central asian nations. the event gave great impetus to strengthening the role of women not only in afghanistan, but in the whole central asian region – helping to improve their lives and to influence their future. new globalization trends imply cross-border threats and challenges, requiring a new paradigm of addressing them. these transnational challenges are specific but common to particular regions, especially conflict-prone ones, and necessitate transit from “country-specific” to “regional” strategy to tackle them. regional strategy becomes effective with “whole-of-system” coordination of un structures’ activities region-wide. as a pilot case we offer the establishment of a un regional hub for sdgs in almaty. the city already hosts over a dozen of un offices with regional, sub-regional and multi-country mandates. this sound un field presence successfully promotes sdgs in our region for years. and i am happy to announce that as a host country, we will provide these offices with a state-of-the-art, fully equipped and furnished building, specifically designed as per un requirements by the end of this year. dear colleagues, as an example of regional cooperation, i would also like to outline the results of the caspian summit held a month ago in the city of aktau in western kazakhstan. we all are extremely satisfied and proud that the longawaited legal status of the caspian sea has been agreed and determined by the five littoral countries. the treaty creates a solid legal basis for further comprehensive interaction between all the caspian states, strengthening regional security and stability, as well as the efficient use of the sea resources. !4 i would like to emphasize that the caspian sea has become an area of peace, harmony, good neighborliness and enhanced international cooperation. ladies and gentlemen, today, the ability to show global leadership and responsibility is challenged by the numerous threats – from spread of weapons – conventional and of mass destruction, as well as terrorism, extremism, organized crime, and all forms of trafficking, to food, water, energy and health insecurities. from violation of the human rights, particularly rights of women, youth and children, degrading human dignity to lack of respect and justice for all. kazakhstan tries its best to stay on the vanguard of tackling these international challenges, as well as seeking innovative solutions for them. we fully support the efforts of the secretary-general to implement his reforms for peace and security architecture, the un development system and management. we will contribute towards improving shared responsibility, transparency and overall coordination of all un organs to achieve these goals. we are engaged in reforming the methods of work of the security council so as to enhance its relevance, transparency, accountability and effective capacity to respond speedily to varying crises. madam/mr. president, kazakhstan stays committed to strengthening peacekeeping with clear and achievable mandates, highly qualified personnel and adequate resources. we will increase our contribution to un peacekeeping operations through innovative forms of partnerships including co-deployment. we will deploy a unit and additional officers to un peacekeeping missions, during this 73rdsession, and expand their number in the future. being fully supportive to the concept of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention and confidence-building president of kazakhstan initiated creating the un regional center for preventive diplomacy for central asia, as well as the conference on interaction and confidence-building measures in asia, which comprises 27 countries, spanning from the middle to far east and south-east asia. my country has proven itself to be a moral leader in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, having renounced the world's fourth largest nuclear arsenal and the world's largest nuclear test site in semipalatinsk. we call upon all other countries to follow our example as nuclear weapons do not ensure either real power or true protection. protection is provided through the trust of the international community. !5 kazakhstan signed the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons on 2 march 2018, following its engaged participation in the elaboration and adoption of the treaty. now we are processing its ratification. the early entry into force of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty remains a key goal for us. our country, one of the most impacted by the harmful consequences of nuclear tests, is making great efforts to reach global zero. we therefore sponsored general assembly resolution 64/35 that established the international day against nuclear tests. three weeks ago, member states commemorated the ninth observance of the day, with the un general assembly firmly supporting the urgent and complete end to all nuclear testing. the creation of nuclear weapon free zones remains one of the most effective measures in combating the spread of wmd. with this in mind, president nursultan nazarbayev proposed strengthening the cooperation between nuclear weapons free zones and convening inter-zone conferences on a regular basis. astana proposes hosting the first such meeting. we are also steadfastly advocating for the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and call on all the parties involved to agree on mutually acceptable conditions to keep the negotiation process on. we also support preserving and ensuring the proper implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa) for iran and the thorough investigation of chemical crimes in syria, and also preventing chemical terrorism. dear colleagues, countering terrorism is of special significance for my country. kazakhstan has ratified 16 of the 19 un instruments on combating terrorism, with measures taken for the early accession to the remaining three treaties. stronger global leadership in fighting terrorism remains crucial. we must do more to address the roots of radicalization using best practices and relevant un instruments. we are actively working under the joint plan of action for implementing the un global counter-terrorism strategy (gcts) in central asia. having contributed 300,000 us dollars, kazakhstan has become the first donor of its third phase, and we thank other donors too. addressing the general assembly in 2015, president nazarbayev put forward several counter-terrorism initiatives: the creation of a global counter-terrorism coalition/network and the adoption of a comprehensive un document on combating terrorism. in this context, our country is offering !6 the code of conduct towards achieving a world free of terrorism, inviting all countries to closely coordinate in the fight against this evil. we commend all our partners for their support. the code singing ceremony was just held earlier this afternoon at a high-level special event with seventy member states having joined the document, to whom we are very grateful. the code remains open for signing by other states and we invite you all to manifest your good will in fighting this disastrous phenomenon. madam/mr. president, our strong conviction is that comprehensive success in the area of “hard security” is impossible without success in achieving the sustainable development goals. we have launched a number of initiatives to implement the sdgs: the renowned international expo 2017 exhibition on the theme of future energy; the post-expo international center for green technologies and investment projects; the annual astana economic forum; the kazaid development agency, the regional hub for excellence in civil service; the regional center for disaster risk reduction, and the antinarcotic central asian regional information coordination center. all of these have many promising prospects for the future. kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country. it also is a part of the biggest landlocked region of central asia and afghanistan, and the farthest away from any ocean. it has made many strides in achieving connectivity and turning what can be termed as “landlockedness” into “landlinkedness”. based on the outcomes of the implementation of almaty program of action and working jointly on the fulfilling of the vienna program of action for lldcs we strive to further expand communications, enhance infrastructure, boost trade and transit, counter climate change, and improve energy efficiency. that was why kazakhstan along with the un office of high representative for lldcs, ldcs and sids hosted 16-17 may 2018 in astana the lldcs ministerial meeting on improving transport connectivity and trade facilitation. the conference increased the visibility for the needs of lldcs on international stage and contributed to mobilizing global support to improve lives of millions of people in geographically disadvantaged countries. we are ready to share our experiences in promoting the goals of our large scale “third modernization” program, geared towards joining the top 30 most developed nations, through innovative development, bold institutional reforms, sound investments and extensive international cooperation and knowledge-sharing. !7 in this context, south-south cooperation is gaining importance for us. together with the un system, and other partners, we will continue to extend assistance to african countries, focusing on resolving conflicts, strengthening political stability and security, and promoting sustainable peace and development. with undp, our first successful experience was a $2 million project, entitled “africa – kazakhstan partnership for the sdgs”, as well as biogas projects for sids with un escap. the recent establishment of the islamic organization for food security in astana will contribute to humanitarian assistance effort through the creation of food reserves. also, a new initiative of oic cooperation in the area of science and technologies will serve the purpose of narrowing the digital and it gap between the developed and developing countries. madam/mr. president, kazakhstan’s hallmarks, among many others, are pluralism, and interfaith accord. they are promoted through an unprecedented dialog platform, the triennial congress of leaders of world and traditional religions in astana. its “added value” is it brings together religious and political leaders, international organizations, civil society and turns the paradigm of conflict and clash of cultures and religions into a unique model of tolerance and harmony. president nazarbayev has unveiled a new program of spiritual modernization of the kazakh society “rukhani zhangyru (spiritual enlightenment)”, blending tradition with contemporary elements. i can convey the essence of the initiative in his words: “dreaming of our great future, we should not forget about our worthy past” (мечтая о нашем великом будущем, не следует забывать и о нашем достойном прошлом). madam/mr. president, before i conclude, i reiterate that it is only through our collective will and solidarity we can turn this world in crisis into a world of hope and promise. the united nations should stay open and relevant to all people, since it is our common responsibility to leave a strengthened and well used heritage to move towards peaceful, equitable and sustainable society where no one is left behind. in conclusion i want to again refer to the words of nelson mandela – “it is in your hands to create a better world for all who live in it”. we do need to turn our good will and good words into good action. as president of kazakhstan h.e. nursultan nazarbayev clearly stated: “the time to look ahead is now. the time for action is now. the time to show our will is now. the time to make a difference is now” (пришло время смотреть !8 вперед. пришло время браться за дело. пришло время проявить волю. пришло время изменить саму жизнь). i thank you!","kairat abdrakhmanov, minister for foreign affairs of kazakhstan, said his country is creating a thriving economy and aims to be among the top 30 advanced economies in the world by 2050 through new development initiatives on the national and international levels. on the regional level, the government is committed to extending partnerships among central asian countries where the collective goal is to create a cooperative region that is a zone of peace, security, trust and development. the stability of afghanistan is of particular interest to kazakhstan, he said, adding that afghan women should play a crucial role. to that end, kazakhstan hosted the regional conference on empowering women in afghanistan in september 2018. he went on to emphasize the need for regional rather than country-specific strategies in addressing cross-border threats and challenges, offering, as a pilot case, almaty as the site of a united nations regional hub for the sustainable development goals. kazakhstan is also committed to strengthening peacekeeping with clear and achievable mandates, and will soon increase its contribution to peacekeeping operations, he said. kazakhstan is also committed to preventative diplomacy and nuclear disarmament, as evidenced by its signing of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in march 2018 and its sponsorship of general assembly resolution 64/35 for the international day against nuclear tests. reaffirming his country’s support for the iran nuclear agreement and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula, he said the fight against terrorism is also particularly significant for kazakhstan, calling upon member states to ratify the relevant united nations instruments and address the root causes of radicalization. as the world’s largest landlocked country, kazakhstan strives to achieve connectivity, expand communications and enhance trade, he said, recalling that, in may, it hosted a ministerial meeting of landlocked developing nations to address those issues with the office of the high representative for the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states. kazakhstan will continue to extend assistance to african countries, he said, adding that it remains committed to pluralism and interfaith accord."
Kenya,"permanent mission of the republic o keny to the united nations 866 u.n. plaza, rm 304, new york, ny 10017 statement by h.e mr. uhuru kenyatta president and commander in-chief of the defense forces of the republic of kenya during the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly september 26, 2018 united nations, new york tel: (212) 421-4740/1, fax: (212) 486-1985 email: kenya@un.int 1. i warmly congratulate you madam president, on your election to preside over the 73rd session of the general assembly. i have no doubt that the experience from your distinguished career in the service of the republic of ecuador will be invaluable to your new responsibility. 2. i also note with appreciation that your strategic priorities for the 73rd session namely, strengthening multilateralism, catalyzing the wellbeing of all persons and a sustainable planet, as well as building a stronger, more efficient multilateral system, converges with kenya s aspirations. it is my pleasure, then, to reaffirm my government s complete commitment to our shared vision and support to you during your tenure. 3. the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly is the second one to be held during the tenure of secretary-general guterres who has already spoken publicly about the financial situation of the un and has even spelt out reforms that need to be executed to ensure optimal utilization of our finances. 4. i applaud the secretary-general for his efforts and courage to cut costs and for his commitment to ensure the un's resources are better managed. indeed, i am convinced part of these objectives will be achieved with the adoption of the proposals made in regard to the adoption of the global service delivery model. in this regard, it is my hope that kenya will have the privilege to host one of the proposed three such centers. 5. i also applaud the commitment of the un staff who are engaged daily in tackling a myriad of challenges that are greater than any one country or region can solve on its own. 6. kenya strongly supports the general assembly's embrace of better alignment in the mandates of urbanization, human settlement, and environmental governance. this will enable the un human settlements program and the un environmental program to fully deliver on their role as global focal points on human settlements and the environment matters across the un system. 1 7. madam president, even as we speak of important reforms at the united nations, we must recognize that the need for reforms is much broader and of great significance. 8. in almost every part of the world, a growing lack of trust is opening a dangerous gap between citizens and their governing institutions. this is partly a result of the impact of a number of significant factors. key among them is the growing demand by the citizenry for accountability, occasioned by an attendant awareness of the gap between available resources and the provision of services to the populations. these demands are also fueled by a growing awareness of the scourge of corruption and wastage of public resources, and their negative effects on the lives and hopes of people. 9. never before in human history, due to the benefits of accessible information, have so many people known how public trust is undermined by the acts of commission or omission by a few individuals and networks, both in the private and public sector. weak systems of governance are manipulated and exploited for the gain of predatory interests at the expense of the common man. the free press and social media are rife with news of outright fraud, cynical conflicts of interest, and financial arrangements that privatize gains during prosperous times then socialize losses during economic catastrophe. 10. added to individual corruption, major corporations are misrepresenting their earnings to deny governments revenues needed for investment in public goods. the extraction of mineral and other resources continues to be subject to corrupt dealings that not only deny communities and countries any benefit but that almost routinely lead to violence and instability. these dealings, have over several decades been clothed with the garments of legality, institutionalizing the exploitation by cartels and oligopolies that are pillaging africa and other underdeveloped regions of all their natural wealth. hence, the popular theorizing of africa s resource curse. 11. it has become clearer to citizens all over the world that what is enabling the illegal and illicit conduct of corrupt individuals and 2 ! companies is a globalized financial and legal system. its impact is worldwide but is probably leads to the most suffering in africa. ¦ 12. there is increasing evidence that africa is a net exporter of much- needed capital to the world through illicit outflows. conservative estimates indicate that between 1980 and 2009, illicit money outflows from africa ranged between 1.2 to 1.4 trillion dollars, roughly equal to africa s current gdp and surpassing by far the money it received from outside over the same period. 13. every illicit dollar that leaves africa goes somewhere. most often to where the rest of the money from tax evaders and criminals is hidden. africans suffer as a result, but the irony is that what is done to africa, eventually is done to the rest of the world. 1 . the present system of transferring and laundering illicit capital is enabling corrupt networks all over the world to illegally acquire in one country, while being welcomed with open arms as investors in another country. the same system is used by drug cartels and even terrorist organizations. collectively, drug addiction, violent extremism, international crime and terrorist actions result visit misery and hurt to millions of victims all over the world. ! 15. madam president, the most dramatic manifestation of the destructive impact of the result misery of the effect of the crimes above is the loss of trust in governing institutions at the national, regional and global level. as people observe the impunity of the corrupt, they increasingly feel that the economic systems are rigged against their hopes. the trust deficit grows. 16. often times, institutions of government have become vehicles to capture for ethnic or racial interests articulated by populists and extremists who thrive in chronic instability and drive it forward with their incitement. when networks and cartels in government capture the state for their own selfish gain, and represent themselves as champions of an ethnic or religious group, the result is all too often civil strife and civil war. in such an atmosphere, the result of a political competition can begin to seem like an existential threat to groups and their members. 3 ladies and gentlemen, 17. the fragility of our world is also manifest in instability and conflicts, as in the case of both somalia and south sudan. 18. in somalia, amisom is a unique regional effort that has deeply degraded one of al qaeda s most ambitious affiliates. kenya has been part of this journey from the start. it was in nairobi where a transitional federal state was negotiated into existence, with the material and moral support of the kenyan people. we have never wavered. kenyans have lost lives and property in pursuit of peace and stability in somalia, and we appreciate our regional and international colleagues and partners. in somalia, a historic chapter on africa's will to peace and security is being written. we appreciate the partners standing with the region. 19. the job is not yet done. we must ensure military success over al shabaab if other political and economic solutions are to take firm root. so far, the troop contributing continue to bear a disproportionate burden. we have consistently sought for international support that is commensurate with the threat scenario, including in the form of enablers and force multipliers. these have not been forthcoming. what the international community is doing with somalia is not good enough. we understand that these are difficult times economically, but global terrorism must be faced boldly if we have learnt any real lessons in the last 20 years. amisom needs support, let us make it happen. 20. in building peace there are no silver bullets, the process of bring stability and peace to south sudan requires commitment to walk closely with the south sudanese parties particularly now after the signing of the revitalized peace agreement. kenya is proud for having walked with sudan and south sudan in their pursuit of peace and stability. we have always known and firmly believe that the constancy of our effort would yield the fruit of a prosperous and free south sudan. 21. we are calling on all of you to join us in this endeavor for peace and stability in south sudan, i appeal to you, neighbors, donors, international agencies and friends of south sudan all to redouble your efforts and support this cause end the suffering of the children, women and men of south sudan. 4 ladies and gentlemen, 22. allow me to turn to the global sphere which has also not been spared of the challenges of today. multilateralism is under severe strain - as evidenced by our global trading and economic management system. rarely has the system of trade and security that was established following the second world war, under the aegis of the united nations, been under greater strain. the populism and extremism unleashed at the national level has brought forward powerful constituencies that want a dismantling of the global order. 23. i believe that the most urgent political task in the world today is to close the trust gap between people and governing institutions. governments are not owed trust by citizens; that trust must be won and protected. it is not an exaggeration to say that on this issue revolves the future of global stability and the continuity of many states. 24. your excellencies, madam president, there are bold solutions that we must embrace to succeed. 25. we have to fight impunity and corruption. seriously and without fear or favor. in kenya, we are undertaking an aggressive campaign against fraud and abuse of public trust. we have reached out to our partners in switzerland and the united kingdom to take action against transfers of illegal proceeds of corruption to their banking and financial systems. we will pursue more such bilateral agreements. 26. they must be accompanied by determined reforms, that are subject to clear timelines and standards, in the multilateral system that combat systemic corruption, money laundering and the offshoring of illicit outflows. the single overarching aim must be to make it exceedingly difficult to transfer and launder illegally acquired wealth in any part of the world. 27. all un bodies should be tasked with detecting corruption in their different focus areas and promoting the skills and systems to combat it. in the understanding that honest, transparent and responsive government is fundamental to the achievement of their aims. 5 28. we must create a stronger understanding of the presence and impact of corruption in their different focus areas. 29. the gap in trust at the global level is aimed squarely at the leadership and processes of the multilateral system as reflected in the un security council, the bretton woods institutions and other parts of the system. in the years following the second world war, the present status quo was functional and understandable. no more almost 75 years later. the global governance system must reform if it is to be relevant and effective. 30. the clearest sign that change is real will be in reforms to the membership of the un security council. kenya joins in the demand for two permanent seats for africa with all the rights and prerogatives of current members, including the right of veto, and additional non-permanent seats. as we all know, africa is under represented in the non-permanent category of the security council and not represented at all in the permanent category. this historical injustice is a clear indication of the skewed system that has perpetuated an exclusive model of governance that fuels the trust gap between nations. the governance, leadership and employment in un funds, programs and agencies must also become more noticeably inclusive of the global south and africa. 31. kenya is a proud host to the only un global headquarters in the global south that includes the unep and un habitat. we are strongly committed to supporting their mandates and effectiveness. and we believe, strongly, that the multilateralism that would headquarter major organizations in africa and the global south is what the world needs. global decision-making needs more of africa, if the world is to respond wisely to the demographic and economic shifts underway.

expressed strong support for the general assembly’s intention to better enable the united nations human settlement program (un-habitat) and the united nations environment program (unep) to fulfill their global mandates. however, he said there was a need for broader reforms. in almost every part of the world, there is a growing trust gap between citizens and their governing institutions, due to growing awareness of the scourge of corruption and wastage of public resources. pointing beyond individual corruption, he said major corporations are misrepresenting earnings to deny governments revenues needed for investment in public goods. the corrupt dealings of cartels and oligopolies pillaging africa’s resources “have over several decades been clothed in the garments of legality”, leading to “popular theorizing of africa’s resource curse” he said. continuing, he said that citizens all over the world are more aware that a globalized financial and legal system enables the illegal conduct of corrupt individuals, with africa probably enduring the most suffering. saying evidence increasingly marked africa as a net exporter of capital through illicit outflows, he cited conservative estimates that the outflow ranged between $1.2 and $1.4 trillion between 1980 and 2009, roughly equal to the continent’s current gross domestic product (gdp) and “surpassing by far the money it received from outside over the same period”. illicit capital powers a global corrupt network used by drug cartels and even terrorist organizations, driving a loss of trust in national, regional and global governing institutions, and thus enabling populists and extremists who thrive in chronic instability. turning to international conflict, he praised the regional efforts of the african union mission in somalia (amisom), which has degraded one of al-qaida’s most ambitious affiliates. “kenya has been part of this journey from the start”, he said, as in nairobi, the kenyan people had provided material and moral support to negotiate a transitional federal state into existence. the kenyan people have lost lives and property in pursuit of peace in somalia, and the job is not yet done. with military success over al-shabaab a necessity for other political and economic solutions, he called for international support commensurate with the threat scenario. “what the international community is doing with somalia is not good enough,” he stated. in south sudan, he said that forging stability and peace requires a commitment to work closely with south sudanese parties in the wake of a revitalized peace agreement. kenya is proud of its role there and calls on the international community to redouble efforts to end the suffering of its people, as “in building peace there are no silver bullets”. globally, he said multilateralism is under severe strain, threatening the system of trade and security established after the second world war under the aegis of the united nations. calling for bold solutions, he said the global community must fight impunity and corruption, fraud and abuse of public trust. kenya has reached out to partners in switzerland and the united kingdom to counter transfers of illegal proceeds to their banking and financial systems, but bilateral agreements must come with determined reforms. saying that one such reform must occur in the security council, he called for two permanent seats for africa to counter the “historical injustice” of its under-representation in the non-permanent member category. “global decision-making needs more of africa, if the world is to respond wisely to the demographic and economic shifts under way,” he said."
Kiribati,"statement by his excelle cy t eti maamau te beretite ti of the rep blic of kiribati the ge eral debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly wednesday, 26th september 2018 () i madam president excellencies secretary general observers ladies and gentlemen i begin by sharing the peace and blessings among us all and to convey warm pacific greetings from the government and the people of kiribati. in the name of the almighty go - kam na bane ni auri acknowledgement adam president, s join other leaders in congratulating you and the government of ecuador, for your election to the presidency of the 73rd session of the general assembly. i wish you every success as you discharge your functions by making th s united nations of family relevant to all members. in the same token, i would also like to acknowledge the outgoing president, h.e. mr. miroslav lajcak and the republic of slovakia for a very engaging and outcome oriented leadership of the 72nd session, and thanking the secretary general, for his excellent leadership in particular the current reform to make the united nations fitting and more adaptable for now and eyon . reflection on the t eme » making the un relevant w th people at its heart madam president, we commend you for the t eme you have c osen for the 73rd session. making the united nations relevant to ail p opl : global leadership and sha ed responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies . indeed, this is a strong call and reminder to all leaders and the un machinery, that the effectiveness of our efforts is not measured by how much we have ac ieved, but by how much those we serve have made a better change in their lives. clearly, this was the primary intent of the founders t at this should be the un as they envisioned t. it is about servant leadership, where leadership is not only about serving, ut more importantly about protecting the lives of the powerless, those without a voice, those taken advantage of by the more powerful in society, and those w o cannot help t e politically. we are often reminded time and again that these people s lives are precious in the sight of god. in her captivating and si ple words, mother theresa made a powerful reflection on good leadership, w en she said a life not lived for others is not a life . as leaders, it is our shared responsibility to ensure that we see to t at. the theme also provides a timely call for a renewal of friendship, solidarity, co¬ operation and partnership between and among peoples and nations of the world, allowing greater commitment on all our part, to make a difference to the wellbeing of all. contextualizing the theme from national and regional experiences madam president, kiribati had long recognized the prime importance of peaceful living, characterized by our own traditional humble way of living in harmony with each ' other and our environment. these are sustained through regular community meetings in trad tional local meeting houses called maneaba to discuss important agenda for the village and to address issues under the wise and experienced gui ance of the elders. decisions are made to promote mutual understanding, respect and co¬ operation among members of the society. a maneaba means to embrace all ( manea te aha ), a holistic system where leadership and shared responsibility is undertaken for the benefit of the whole society. in such ways, the maneaba system maintains its fundamentality as central and relevant to the people. in the pacific context, there are other various elevant instruments adopted to address socio-econo ic and political risks and security. some have worked while others ha e not. but this oes not stop us from our resolve through our own pacific way to undertake meaningful dialog, where agreement through consensus serves as a prevalent norm. also, the pacific accounts for 20% of the world s ocean in terms of our eez and therefore, the completion of maritime boundaries is very critical, to provide certainty to the ownership of our ocean space, in the face of climate change. un for freedom a united world, free from the threats of wars and violence rooted by our greed to dominate others is the kind of world that we want for ail of us and for our children’s gene ation. our ultimate aim is to ensure that everybody can lead a happy, prosperous and secure future. the adoption of the historic united nations law of the sea in 1982 has also enabled us to own and sustainably manage a huge area of ocean, from which we can further improve our wellbeing and enjoy returns from our fisheries resources. the com rehensive nuclear test ban treaty has also assured us that the radiation related illnesses suffered by our people during and after the 1960’s nuclear testing on christmas island and other parts of the world, will not be repeated in the future. there are man other examples of where international resolutions and instru ents have contributed immensely to our national efforts to improve our islands way of life. we have no doubt that other eople and nations see the unite nations in the same light. strengthening the un governance & accountability as an organization, the united nations is bound to be constantly pulled and pushed between two opposing but interconnecte interests. the personal interests of those leading and driving it on the one hand, and the interest of the people for whom it exists on the other hand. it is therefore critical that this asse bly has the ability to ensure t at, a balance is maintained so that the united nations does not end up being good only for those running and facilitating its operations. in this regard, we look forward to the outcome of the reform of t e development system of the united nations to w ich our views have been adequately expressed through statements made on our behalf by the psids, aosis, the ldcs and g77+ china groupings. in particular, we look forward to the positioning of a new resident coordinator to serve t e northern and central pacific countries. 3 we also look forward to the outcome of other reforms and reviews pertaining to the security council, t e human rights council, the eligibility and graduation criteria in relation to least developed countries and finally, on the financing status of the united nations. we also fully appreciate the united nations with its special focus on the plight of people in developing countries especially those facing special difficulties. in this connection we note with gratitude the committee on development policy (cdp) recognition of kiribati s extreme vulnerability to climate change impacts, and the need for special support. this gratitude extends to the president and members of the economic and social council (ecosoc) for agreeing to our request to have our gra uation case reconsidered in 3 years time from now. making the un financially strong madam president, we are concerned to learn from the secretary general s report the financial difficulties facing the united ations to the extent that it is affecting not only its services but also the wellbeing of its staff. we understand the united nations has depended more on voluntary contributions and private sector funding than fro assessed membership contributions which is a high risk. it is therefore high time we re-assess the validity of certain activities of the un. activities outliving t eir times and need to re-align strategies that were quite applicable and effective during the post war years when states were the key deliverers of the un services. these are no longer effective with un services becoming the exclusive domain of huge multinational corporations that often put profit making over moral and ethical considerations. example is the hundreds of millions of ollars spent annually on peace keeping and humanitarian assistance. these could have been better spent on eliminating root causes of conflicts, armed terrorism and the humanitarian crisis by investing un resources in the establishment of good governance, with good quality free education and health services. in this way, the collective resources of the world are spent to treat the cause and not the mere symptoms. we understand discussions are under way to address the financial crisis facing our global family and would request consideration of the points raised above as our genuine input to such deliberations. achievements and opportunities madam president, kiribati has presented for the first time its voluntary national review report in july this year to the united nations. as i had stressed in the video introduction of our vnr, kiribati has now embarked on a bold and bright narrative - a narrative at carries our people’s voice and deter ination boosted by the various resilience building programs allowing us to forge ahead with a 20 year road map transforming kiribati into a wealthy, healthy, and peaceful nation by 2036. this is our kiribati vision for 20 years or kv20 as it is known, which aspires to move t e nation and people beyond business through the unleashing of the enormous potentials vested in our fisheries and tourism. i must, however, emphasize that underpinning t e drive and implementation of this ambitious aspiration, is making kiribati a corruption free society as part of our strong commitment to champion anti-corruption in the pacific. we will follow this through ith regional leaders meeting on anti-corruption in 2019 on our shores. corruption is undeniably a human risk to all forms of development and it is the weak and the marginalized who suffer and bear the cost of such unethical practices. kiribati have also launched for the first time ever, its first climate change policy. t is focuses on building and strengthening the resilience of our islands and our peoples resilience to adapt to the impacts of climate change. the policy highlights priority areas in water and sanitation, coastal protection and renewable energy and will serve as the country’s national compass for delivery of ail climate change programs in kiribati. we acknowledge our many partners who had and continue to work with kiribati. we welcome those ho are also ready to work and journey together with us to build and strengthen the resilience of our people and islands. kiribati s contribution to the world to t is end, i am pleased to reaffirm that we are continuing to maintain 11% of our eez in the phoenix islands (comprising over 400,000 sq.km of ocean) as a marine protected area. this well-known area, the phoenix islands rotected area (pipa) is considered as a powerful and effective tool for t e rejuvenation of tuna fisheries and other marine organisms and a source of resilient coral species called super corals . from our understanding of the early findings of science, pipa is home to one of the richest and most diverse and resilient marine ecosystem on eart . it has t e potential to become the most powerful source of marine life enrichment and provides solutions for many of t e problems facing humanity, t at the 2030 agenda is trying to address. by closing off the area to commercial fishing, we have sacrificed a substantial amount of income from fishing licenses every year, estimated at about 10% of our annual fishing revenue, which on average is $10milsion per year. that is revenue forgone, but this is part of kiribati’s strong commitment to implement the un’s sdg goals. in addition, i am also proud to inform that kiribati has also declared our entire eez as the shark s sanctua y which has been domesticated in our laws. in this respect, we com end current efforts towards creation of new legally binding instruments on the use of marine biolog cal diversity in areas of sea outside our eez, migration, and on the environment, all of which are very important for small islands like kiribati including other nations and peoples. the way forward madam president, the un theme that will be delivered in the next 12 months is about all the people living on t is planet. t is theme will be irrelevant if the un continues to ignore that 23 million people w o live and contribute to our shared ome and continue to exclude t em from t e process. we are one family and we therefore call on an inclusive approach to ave taiwan participate in international processes an to

the united nations machinery that the effectiveness of the organization’s efforts is not measured by how much we have achieved, but by how much those we serve have seen a better change in their lives. he said that kiribati has long recognized the importance of peaceful living characterized by a traditional and humble way of living in harmony, something that is sustained through regular community meetings in traditional local meeting houses called “maneaba”. “maneaba” means to embrace all in a holistic system. in the pacific context, there are other instruments to address the socioeconomic and political risks in the country, as the pacific accounts for 20 per cent of the world’s ocean in terms of exclusive economic zone. therefore, the completion of maritime boundaries is very critical. he noted the adoption of the historic united nations law of the sea, which in 1982 enabled the country to own and sustainably manage a huge area of ocean. in addition, he noted the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty assured that radiation illnesses suffered by citizens will not be repeated. moving on to united nations governance and accountability, he said that the organization is constantly pulled between opposing but interconnected interests, but that it was critical the assembly could ensure that balance was maintained. he expressed concern that the financial difficulties facing the united nations were impacting its services and the well-being of staff. therefore, it is high time to reassess the validity of certain activities of the united nations, ones which were applicable during the post-war years but are no longer effective with united nations services becoming the exclusive domain of huge multinational corporations. he gave the example of peacekeeping and the hundreds of millions of dollars spent, money that could be better utilized on eliminating the root causes of conflicts, armed terrorism and humanitarian crises by investing in good governance, education and health. highlighting other opportunities, he noted that his country launched its first climate change policy, which focuses on resilience and priority areas in water and sanitation as well as coastal protection. to this end, he reaffirmed that kiribati was continuing to maintain 11 per cent of exclusive economic zone in the phoenix islands. in this respect, he commended current efforts towards new legally binding instruments on the use of marine biological diversity."

peace, mercy and blessings of allah be upon you on behalf of the government and the people of the state of kuwait, it pleases me at the outset, to extend our sincere congratulations to you personally, and your friendly country, the republic of ecuador, on your election as president of the 73""^^ session of the united nations general assembly. i would also like to assure you of our full support, in all what would facilitate your work and the fulfillment of your responsibilities. we are fully confident of your ability to assume this role, and are certain that your experience in international issues will contribute positively to the conduct of the work of this session. i would also like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my country's sincere appreciation for the outstanding efforts exerted by your predecessor. his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak, during his capable and successful presidency of the previous session. in this respect, i would be remiss if i do not pay tribute to the great efforts of his excellency, the secretary-general of the united nations, mr. antonio guterres, in leading this organization, according to a vision and ideas derived from the principles and alms of the united nations charter, centered around the maintenance of international peace and security, while emphasizing our support of his reformative initiatives, particularly those that relate to the peaceful settlement of conflicts, which have promoted the approach of preventatlve diplomacy and moved it from its academic frameworks and limited experimental phases to the plane of systematic application, in accordance with an international plan seeking to harmonize effective reforms that would advance the role that we expect from the united nations. diwan of j'de frime umstcr state of'kuwait ^ ^ madam president, preventing and resolving conflicts by peaceful means, has been and continues to be one of the most important reasons for the establishment of the united nations. after the bioody experiences of the first and second world wars, and despite their unprecedented catastrophic consequences on humanity, those wars were the original motivation to develop a meaningful international system, to protect our present and future generations from the scourge of war. the past seven decades have witnessed historical and concrete roles for the united nations, during which it has developed its working methods and expanded its mandates, to including humanitarian, political, security, developmental, and economic issues in various parts of the world. however, the increased frequency of challenges and the exacerbation of the severity of conflicts, and the risks they pose for international peace and security, have exposed the urgent need to bolster the ability of the united nations, to provide the required response to the challenges our world faces today, such as the spread of the phenomenon of violence, extremism, and terrorism, as well as the dangers of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in addition to the continuous violations of human rights and the phenomenon of climate change, and other challenges. here, the proposals and plans that the secretary-general has introduced to restructure the secretariat with a view to enhance its effectiveness and increase its efficiency, to ensure that its efforts in ending conflicts are not squandered, come as a preliminary important step to transform the problem of reform, from a hypothesis of discussion to a realistic application. here, we renew our support for this step, which concretizes part of the aspirations of the peoples of the world towards this organization, as a safe haven and the guarantor of a world of peace and stability. madam president, after nine months of non-permanent membership on the security council, for the period 2018-2019, the state of kuwait has become increasingly aware of the importance of reforming the security council to make it more capable of shouldering its responsibilities to face up to the growing challenges of today's world, reflecting the international reality in which we live today, in a manner that would strengthen its credibility and legitimacy, as well as having a diwan of mm 'fue frime umster state of'kuwait permanent arab representation commensurate with the number of arab member states, and the size of their contributions to the various activities of the united nations. since the first day of its non-permanent membership on the councii, the state of kuwait was keen on adhering to an objective approach in dealing with the various issues and fiies iisted on the council's agenda. such an approach comes as a realistic refiection of its foreign policy, based on the respect of the sovereignty and independence of states, and the non-interference in their internal affairs. additionally we believe in the lofty message of the united nations organization seeking to maintain international peace and security. although the security council agenda is replete with middle eastern issues, nonetheless kuwait's involvement with this agenda was not constrained by any cultural, ethnic, political, or geographical considerations through our non-permanent membership on the councii, we have sought to go beyond the routine of participation in the work of the council. therefore we have aimed to broader horizons, with the objective of elevating the rule of international law, with ail of its branches, including respect for human rights, building a better future for the world's population, and totally avoiding selectivity and bias in dealing with the various issues. this trend, based on the charter of the united nations & the diplomatic legacy of the state of kuwait, gives preference to the peaceful solutions and mediation efforts between the parties. this reflects the manner in which we deal with the difficult issues and crises ravaging our world today. the human being and his inherent rights continue to be the pillars of our foreign policy, as based on the directions of his highness, sheik sabah al-ahmad ai-jaber aisabah, the amir of the state of kuwait, who was honored by this esteemed organization as a leader of humanitarian work. madam president, the palestinian question is one of the most important and oldest issues iisted on the agenda of the security council. this year marks the 70*^ anniversary of the issuance of resolution 56 in august 1948, being the first time the councii dealt with this protracted question. although successive resolutions were issued by the united nations security council and general assembly, in addition to the multiple international and regional initiatives diwan of 'fde frm umsur state of'kuwait seeking to lay the foundations of peace in the middle east, israel persists in its intransigence, rejecting and ignoring the resolutions of international legitimacy, and continues its expansionist policies through the establishment of illegal settlements on occupied palestinian territories. this constitutes a gross defiance and blatant rejection to implement resolutions of international legitimacy, the latest of which was resolution 2334 (2016) which demanded the cessation of all israeli illegal settlement practices. furthermore, israel continues desecrating the sanctity of the holy al-aqsa mosque in jerusalem. this is in addition to its abusive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, by detaining thousands of palestinians in its prisons and detention centers, and its repeated military aggressions in the gaza strip, during which it did not observe the basic principles for the protection of civilians in armed conflicts, including during foreign occupation, and did not adhere to the agreed upon international measures set forth in the fourth geneva convention of 1949 concerning the protection of civilians in time of war. out of keenness of the state of kuwait on the full enforcement of security council resolutions, we presented a draft resolution to the security council last may, which demanded from israel, the occupying power, to immediately cease the use of illegitimate force against civilians, and called for international protection to ensure the safety and security of the palestinian civiiian population in the occupied territories. despite the non-adoption of the draft resolution, the state of kuwait shall not spare any effort in support of the legitimate political rights of the palestinian people. this shall continue until the end of the occupation and the attainment of a permanent, just, and comprehensive peace, in accordance with the initiative calling for land for peace, the arab peace initiative, and the implementation of all resolutions relating to international legitimacy, calling for the two state solution, and the establishment of a palestinian state within the borders of the 4^*^ of june of 1967, with east jerusalem as its capital. madam president, the syrian crisis has entered its 8^*^ year, due to the inability of the international community to find a solution, ending its devastating consequences and horrific losses. throughout, the syrian citizen has been the main victim in a conflict which resulted in more than 400,000 people dead. this 'dimn of 'mm 'fde frime (minister state of'kuv/ait ^ ^ is in addition to more than 12 million refugees and displaced persons. the state of kuwait, in cooperation & coordination with the friendly delegation of the kingdom of sweden, has submitted resolution 2041, in regard to the humanitarian situation in syria. the security council's unanimous adoption of this resolution reflects a positive signal of solidarity and unity with respect to putting an end to human suffering, the cessation of hostile acts, and guaranteeing access to humanitarian assistance for those in need within syrian territories in a timely fashion. yet, today, we regret that the resolution was not implemented nor adhered to on the ground. these efforts take place in the context of the humanitarian role pursued by the state of kuwait, in dealing with the deteriorating human conditions in syria, since the start of this crisis. in the course of these efforts, the state of kuwait has hosted 3 international conferences for donors supporting the humanitarian situation in syria. through these conferences, my country has offered voluntary contributions amounting to 1 billion and six hundred million dollars. now here, we renew our principled and unwavering position regarding the syrian crisis. this position rejects any military solution for this crisis, stressing the importance of working to intensify efforts to bring all parties to a direct dialog, in an effort to reach a peaceful settlement according to relevant security council resolutions, especially resolution 2254. the aim is to achieve a political reality on which various components of the syrian people find consensus. this should preserve the unity and independence of syria, in order to achieve the legitimate aspirations of the syrian people, which guarantee bringing to justice those who committed crimes. madam president, the sisterly state of yemen, is going through sensitive historic challenges with serious implications on the political, humanitarian, and economic planes. these are the consequences of the coup perpetrated against the legitimate authority by the houthi group since september 2014. that group has continued to reject the implementation of relevant security council resolutions, as well as international initiatives aiming at achieving a political settlement. that group has also continued its threats to the peace and stability of the region through the launching of ballistic missiles on the sisterly kingdom of saudi arabia. this has endangered the safety of free navigation di'wan of 'fde fritne mimster stateofxuwait through the strait of bab-ai-mandab and the red sea. in this regard, we stress our severe condemnation for such activities, which contravene international law and the international humanitarian law. from this perspective, we renew our full commitment to respecting yemen's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. we also reject any interference in yemeni internal affairs, emphasizing our full support for the constitutional legitimacy of yemen. that is the country which was the cradle of arab civilization. we also stress the importance of prioritizing the political solution of the crisis through resorting to the three agreed upon references. these are the initiative of the gulf cooperation council countries, and its implementation mechanism, the outcomes of the comprehensive national dialog, and the relevant security council resolutions, especially resolution 2216. in accordance with the method adhered to by kuwaiti diplomacy, inspired by its preventive character, which is based on mediation & political settlement, my country, in the course of 2016, and for more than 100 days, has hosted political consultations between the yemeni parties, under the auspices of the united nations, it is in such framework that we renew our readiness to host our yemeni brethren for the signing of a final agreement whenever it is achieved by the yemeni parties. in this regard, we stress the continuation of support for the united nations efforts, and for those of the special envoy of the secretary general for yemen, aiming at achieving a peaceful solution for this crisis, guaranteeing the shortening of its duration. madam president, the coup against the legitimacy of yemen, had consequences which played a major role in the deterioration of the humanitarian situation there. such results have caused frightening and unprecedented statistics, whereby the yemeni person continues to suffer and strive for securing his daily sustenance. the state of kuwait has not ignored the needs of the brotherly yemeni population. therefore, kuwait has contributed $350 million, the last portion of which was $250 million, which were pledged at the geneva conference held last april. that amount has been delivered in full to un agencies and their mechanisms engaged in humanitarian activities. 'dimn of mmm frm uimster state of'kuwait the purpose of all this aid has been the amelioration of the severity of the dangerous deterioration of the humanitarian, health and economic standards. but, such deterioration of standards will not be arrested without striving for the restoration of peace and stability in yemen, in order to protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the return of harmony to all population sectors. madam president, the spread of the phenomenon of terrorism and violent extremism in the world, especially in the middle east region, is to be regarded as an unprecedented challenge, which has hit the world system to the core. this has happened through the evolution of the ideology of the secretive and rogue organization, which have used islam as a cover for their destructive intentions. the so called ""da'esh"" ""islamic state in iraq and the levant"", a terrorist group which has perpetrated atrocities, including wide spread murder and destruction in various areas of the middle east, has compelled the emergence of an international coalition to fight it. in this regard, the state of kuwait has contributed both material and moral support in accordance with the agreement relating to combating terrorism adopted by the league of arab states, the organization of islamic cooperation and the united nations through the years from 1999-2001. the brotherly iraq has been the first to suffer from the crimes of that terrorist group, yet the collaboration of the international community represented by the security council with the iraqi government has played a role of maximum effectiveness in cleansing the iraqi territory from the geographic positioning of that serious terror cancer. based on our conviction that the peace and security equation in the post-war phase, cannot be achieved except through repairing the destructive effects which are not in consonance with humanitarianism, my country has hosted an international conference which dealt with rebuilding iraq. at that conference, the amount of pledges have exceeded $30 billion, of which the state of kuwait has contributed $2 billion. here we would like to renew our firm position regarding the offering of various types of assistance to iraq in order to enable it to complete the fulfillment of its outstanding obligations provided for by relevant security tlimn of 'fde frm 'minister state of'kuwait vi '' ^ vi'^-'l """" "" "" ) £.♦ council resolutions, with the aim of aiding iraq to regain its role and position regionally and internationally. and in connection with the same regional planes, and guided by the same principles that call for strengthening the rules of good neighborliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of states, as set forth in the united nations charter, we renew our call to the islamic republic of iran to take serious confidence building measures aimed to establish relations based on cooperation, mutual respect, common interests, in a manner that would lead to guiding the efforts and capabilities towards development and construction. this would reflect the future aspiration of all peoples in the region for a life of peace and security. madam president, in accordance with what we have mentioned earlier, regarding the role which my country has committed itself to pursue, and which is based on according special priority to cases of humanitarian nature, and in response to the tragic situation which the refugees of the rohingya muslim minority of myanmar are facing, the state of kuwait has contributed to the organization of a security council visit to both bangladesh and myanmar. here, the aim was to discuss the crisis of those refugees, to get acquainted with their situation and to assess the steps which have been taken by the authorities of these two countries towards this crisis. this is one of the gravest humanitarian crises which have been witnessed by the world. we shall continue our efforts through our membership on the security council, and in cooperation with all parties concerned with guaranteeing a safe, voluntary, and dignified return of these refugees and the bringing to account of those responsible for the crimes committed against them. madam president, the adoption of the agenda on the goals of the 2030 sustainable development plan is considered one of the most remarkable phases of important success for the united nations. that agenda is an extension of the efforts of the international community which are based on the primary rules emanating from the millennium development goals. such goals have achieved their noble objective which stimulated the un transitioning from the epoch of 8 (dimn of 'ffie fme 'umister state ofkumt defining relative goals in confronting the challenges to a new phase stamped by its comprehensiveness and the search for root solutions. this has been a picture whereby the human being has become its primary objective. it is a phase where our fidelities to international obligations and solidarity on the international level shall be the real leap for attaining the sustainable development goals with the aim of eradicating poverty with all of its manifestations and ensuring that all human beings would attain their equal rights to dignity, education, health, political participation, and the empowerment of the young and of women. this would also confront the effects of climate change in the context of the historic paris agreement. this is because environmental degradation is to be considered one of the main obstacles on the road to attaining these goals, in line with the principle of shared responsibility, taking into account the disparity of responsibilities and burdens of states. furthermore, among the most prominent challenges facing sustainable development is perhaps the issues concerning migrants and refugees. in this regard, we look forward to the international conference on migration, which shall be held in december of this year in the city of marrakesh. at that conference, the global compact for safe, orderly, and regular migration will be adopted. and, in the framework of the state of kuwait's pursuit of whatever contributes to the elevation of the styles of life, we have undertaken measures to accord with the implementation of the agenda for sustainable development. these measures had a priority over various national plans and programs, and with the participation of all sectors of society. all of this has been concretized by a futuristic national vision for ""a new kuwait"" to be accomplished by 2035. the aim of this vision is to transform kuwait into a regional center, and a financial, commercial, cultural, and institutional pioneer. the state of kuwait has been keen on shouldering its regional and international responsibilities towards achieving development in all its economic, social, and environmental perspectives. this is being done by going through various long courses, with a view to putting into effect the initiatives of his highness, the amir of the state of kuwait, to advance international partnerships. such partnerships have come to complement the continuous history of kuwait in the developmental and humanitarian fields. \r^t\ v \ . ' '••a y^''t-~<r>i'^ 'diwan of 'fde frime uimster stateof'kuwait ^ ^ in this regard, kuwait has not spared any effort in its striving for the offering of developmental aid to developing countries, as well as least developed countries. these states had so far numbered 106. we perform our role as an active member of the united nations through our various institutions, of which the most prominent is the kuwait fund for arab economic development, by offering grants and soft loans for infrastructure projects in the developing countries. the amount of such assistance is more than double the internationally agreed upon percentage for formal development assistance. i cannot but stress the adherence of the state of kuwait to the international multilateral system and to the principles and purposes of the united nations charter. here, we express our views in the importance and necessity of moving forward with all efforts guaranteeing the continuation and the contribution of our cherished organization, through having all states fulfill their commitments and responsibilities to which they have consented under agreements and international conferences. thereby contributing towards finding fair and just solutions to global threats and challenges. in this way, we would have accomplished the lofty goal of the maintenance of international peace and security. in conclusion, i would like to express my thanks for your attention, and apologize if my statement has taken too long. the peace, mercy, and blessings of allah be upon you 10","jaber al-mubarak al-hamad al sabah, prime minister of kuwait, emphasized his support for the reform of the united nations as envisioned by the secretary-general. he recalled the original motivation for creating the united nations to protect present and future generations from the scourge of war, pointing to the urgent need to bolster the organization’s ability to respond to current challenges like violence, extremism, terrorism, proliferation of mass destruction weapons, violation of human rights and the consequences of climate change, evolving into a safe haven and the guarantor of world peace and stability. on the importance of reforming the security council, he said it must be capable to shoulder today’s challenges and reflect international reality, adding that there should be a permanent seat on the organ for an arab member state. he noted that the agenda of kuwait’s non-permanent membership to the council was not limited by any cultural, ethnic, political or geographical considerations, stressing that he aimed at going beyond the routine of the participation in the work of the organ. on the palestinian question as the oldest issue of the security council, he pointed to resolution 56 (1948) when the organ dealt with the issue for the first time, adding that israel still persists in its intransigence, rejecting and ignoring resolutions of international legitimacy, and continues to expand the establishment of illegal settlements on occupied palestinian territories. he recalled the latest resolution 2334 (2016) calling for the cessation of all israeli illegal settlements. he noted the detention of thousands of palestinians and israel’s military aggressions in the gaza strip while not observing the protection of civilians in armed conflicts. in addition, he deplored the fact that the syrian crisis continues due to the inability of the international community to find a solution. more than 400,000 syrians are dead, and there are more than 12 million refugees and displaced persons, he said. on the importance of direct dialog with all partners to achieve a peaceful settlement, he reaffirmed kuwait’s position on rejecting any military solution for the syrian crisis. on yemen, he said that the houthi group’s threat to stability and peace in the region by launching ballistic missiles to saudi arabia has endangered the safety of free navigation through the strait of bab-al-mandab and the red sea. he reaffirmed his country’s commitment to respect yemen’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity under the legitimate authority of that country. turning to terrorism and violent extremism in the middle east, he pointed to his country’s material and moral support in the fight against the islamic state in iraq and the levant (isil). he reaffirmed kuwait’s assistance to iraq to fulfill its outstanding obligations pursuant to relevant security council resolutions with the aim to aid iraq to regain its role and position in the region and internationally. addressing the issue of the rohyinga muslim minority of myanmar, he reaffirmed kuwait’s continued efforts in cooperation with all parties concerned in guaranteeing a safe, voluntary and dignified return and bringing to account those responsible for the crimes committed against them. mentioning iran, he called for strengthening the rules of good neighborliness and non-interference in internal affairs of the state according to the united nations charter. on the sustainable development goals and the paris agreement, he noted his nation’s support for eradicating poverty; ensuring equal rights to dignity, education, health, and political participation; the empowerment of youth and women; and the implementation of measures to achieve its goals. he pointed to a futuristic national vision for “a new kuwait” to be accomplished by 2035, aiming to transform it into a regional center and a financial, commercial, cultural and institutional pioneer."
Kyrgyzstan,"kyrgyz republic please check asainst delivef statement of h.e. mr. sooronbay jeenbekov president of the kyrgyz republic at the general debate of the 73rd session of the un general assembly new york, 25 september 2018 madam president, ladies and gentlemen, i greet youwarmly on behalfof the freedom-loving and ancient people with the millennial history of the great mountains! from the high rostrum of the united nations, i want to dwell on topical issues that the kyrgyz republic considers urgent and require joint solutions at the national, regional and global levels. madam president, ladies and gentlemen. allow me to welcome all the participants of the 73rd session of the un general assembly on behalf of the kyrgyz republic the global political, economic and environmental situation is changing rapidly. the tendency of regionalism in world politics is growing. price increase, lack of liquidity, ""war"" of sanctions in the economy is continuing. the threat of terrorism and extremism spreads to all countries. preservation of ecological balance has become a global task for the whole planet. despite their origin these issues are the matter of concern of everyone, especially small countries with open economies. the above stated processes have been sensitive for kyrgyzstan. therefore, i believe that today it is well-timed to discuss at the general assembly the relevance of the united nations for all people, as well as global leadership and mutual responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. using the high tribune of the un, i would like to outline the issues of national, regional and global level that are relevant from the position of our country. madam president, ladies and gentlemen, the peaceful transfer of power in the fall of 2017 laid a solid foundation for kyrgyzstan's further progressive democratic development. at present, there is political and social stability in kyrgyzstan. this gives us the opportunity to set ambitious goals for the medium term. kyrgyzstan stands for the development of parliamentary democracy in the country. the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2020 will confirm this again. we are deeply convinced that it is the parliamentary democracy that corresponds to the nature of the development of our society. the fight against corruption remains a priority ofthe state policy of kyrgyzstan. as of today, we are facing the task of political modernization and economic development in accordance with the future requirements. first of all, we are focused on the implementation of judicial and legal reform and the reorganization of law enforcement agencies. sustainable development of all regions of kyrgyzstan is the key to successful development, and this is the most urgent issue for our country. we set the task of improving the investment climate, started building an information society with fair and transparent public administration. kyrgyzstan will continue to consistently strengthen democratic principles in the development of the state. public administration is focused on the needs of every person, ensuring his/her rights, freedoms and justice in society. all the above-mentioned reforms of the medium and long term are included in the national development strategy of kyrgyzstan until 2040. the provisions of the national development strategy for the long-term period meet all the requirements of the un global agenda 2030. in this connection we hope for further support of the un and partner countries on kyrgyzstan's efforts in its development. kyrgyzstan remains committed to the implementation of the un sustainable development goals. ladies and gentlemen. strengthening the entire spectrum of cooperation between the countries of central asia, we consider as the most important factor of ensuring security not only in the region, but also in the world. it is gratifying to note that our cooperation has acquired a positive momentum and has reached a fundamentally new level. the meetings of the heads of states and foreign ministers of the countries of central asia have become traditional. for the kyrgyz republic, the issue of water use is extremely important. the practice of the last decades of using water and energy resources in central asia shows the need to develop new approaches. we are convinced that the integrated use of water and energy resources in the region should be determined by a system of measures aimed at the sustainable development of all the central asian states. therefore, kyrgyzstan has consistently advocated the development and implementation in central asia of mutually beneficial economic mechanisms in this area. ladies and gentlemen, cooperation and comprehensive dialog are considered by the kyrgyz side as the only and without alternative way of solving existing problems. in this context, we also see a special role and a new mission of such regional organizations as the cis, the sco, the csto and the eeu. today, overcoming the isolation policy and developing the vector of cooperation and partnership have become very important. madam president, no state is immune from threats related to terrorism and extremism. the international community must work together more actively to combat this scourge and such phenomena as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and weapons, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. this is very important for us, as we are at the crossroads of drug trafficking. unfortunately, the measures taken by the international community remain insufficient. it is important to pay special attention to solving this common problem of the region. kyrgyzstan reaffirms its commitment to the effective implementation of the un global counterterrorism strategy and supports the joint action plan. coordination of efforts of the states of the region in matters of security, coordination and exchange of operational information is needed. the government of the kyrgyz republic has approved the program for combating extremism and terrorism until 2022. i thank the un for its financial and technical assistance in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking, and we look forward to further support for development partners in matters of security. madam president, the transition to sustainable development is the restoration of natural ecosystems and the environment. kyrgyzstan recognizes climate change as a significant threat to exotic systems and people. we committed ourselves to counteract this global phenomenon by signing the paris agreement. climate change is having an increasing impact on our glaciers and water resources, contributing to the growth of natural disasters in the mountainous regions of the country. these are the main themes of the fourth world mountain forum in kyrgyzstan, organized to discuss new ways of development for the prosperous future of mountain regions. the main issue of regional nature in the sphere of ecology remains the problem of the legacy of the radioactive industry of the soviet era - uranium tailings. to solve this problem, kyrgyzstan held a number of international conferences. at the un site on september 27, we hold an event dedicated to the dangers of uranium mining. with the aim to enter a new stage of actions for reclamation of uranium tailings, kyrgyzstan is taking the initiative to update the un general assembly resolution of 2013 '""the role ofthe international community in averting the radiation threat in central asia"". i would like to take this opportunity to thank our development partners, who render our country significant support in solving this problem. ladies and gentlemen, the problems noted above require the joint work of all states, as well as global and regional institutions. there is a need to create fundamentally new international mechanisms that are adequate to modem challenges and threats. our organization needs changes, and this is already a requirement of time and the present realities. this reform should be based on the principles of universality, broad geographical representation and the widest possible support of the un member states. kyrgyzstan seeks to make its contribution to the common cause of the united nations for peace, global security and sustainable development. in order to draw the attention of the united nations and the world to the problem of small states, kyrgyzstan has put forward its candidacy for non-permanent members of the un security council for the period 2027-2028. the support of countries that have not been elected to the un security council will give confidence in the equality of the members and thereby raise and strengthen the credibility of the organization. kyrgyzstan considers the un as an authoritative and universal international organization. madam president, ladies and gentlemen, it should be emphasized that an important factor in preserving peace, stability, development of cultural diversity and tolerance is the deepening of intercultural dialog. this was brilliantly and talently written in works of our distinguished writer chingiz aitmatov. he made a significant contribution to building peace and exchanging cultures between different peoples. this year, kyrgyzstan and the whole world celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of chingiz aitmatov. the initiative of kyrgyzstan to hold the world nomad games on a regular basis was recognized and supported by the un general assembly. these games have shown that, despite all the complexities and contradictionsof the modern world, the peoples of the world are striving for unity and creation. dear compatriots! our people considered independence to be the highest property and preserving freedom as the apple ofthe eye found its worthy place in the world community. our kyrgyzstan has been recognized as a sovereign state in the international arena. as the great son of the kyrgyz people, the famous writer, philosopher, humanist chingiz aitmatov said ""there is no greaterwealth for a man than to live together and peacefully."" only unity and harmony will save the world! the unity of the people is the main guarantor of the sustainable development of our country. interethnic friendship in society and the responsible attitude of every citizen for the destiny of the country is the basis of success. our future and our happiness are an independent kyrgyzstan and the unity of the people! may god grant mercy to the people of kyrgyzstan and let peace reign in our land! i wish every citizen of the country health, luck, a happy and peaceful life. long live our independent, free kyrgyzstan! thank you","sooronbai jeenbekov, president of kyrgyzstan, noted that the global political, economic and environmental situation is changing rapidly, and regionalism in world politics is growing. our global task is to prevent the spread of terrorism and extremism to all countries and preserve an ecological balance. “these issues are a matter of concern of everyone, especially small countries with open economies,” he said. outlining issues of national, regional and global importance, he said that the peaceful transfer of power in the fall of 2017 laid a solid foundation for his country’s progressive democratic development; this allows for the setting of ambitious goals. he noted the priority of fighting corruption, and the focus on political modernization, economic development, judicial reform and reorganization of law enforcement agencies. strengthening cooperation between the countries of central asia is the most important factor for ensuring security in the region and the world, he stated. in addition, he noted the issue of water use and the need for new approaches that aimed at sustainable development. furthermore, noting that kyrgyzstan is at the crossroads of drug trafficking, he said that measures taken by the international community to combat that scourge have been insufficient. noting the significant threat that climate change poses, he noted its contribution to natural disasters in the mountainous regions of his country, a main theme of the fourth world mountain forum in kyrgyzstan. in addition, another issue is the radioactive industry of the soviet era — uranium tailings. thus, kyrgyzstan held several international conferences. the global problems of today require joint work, he said, as well as new international mechanisms that are adequate to modern threats. the organization needs change to deal with present realities. drawing attention to the problems that small states face in the united nations, kyrgyzstan put forward its candidacy for a non‑permanent seat on the security council for 2027‑2028. he noted kyrgyzstan’s initiative to hold the world nomad games, and ended by quoting writer and humanist chingiz aitmatov: “there is no greater wealth for a man than to live together and peacefully.”"
Lao People’s Democratic Republic,"lao geopfe's (democrotic wpuflfic statement by h.e. mr. saleumxay kommasith, minister of foreign affairs of the lao people's democratic republic, at the 73'd session of the united nations general assembly 29 september 2018, new york madame president, i would like to begin by congratulating you, ms. maria femanda espinosa of garc6s on your election as president general assembly. the 73'd session of the united nations it is our great pleasure to see a woman chairing this august body and i assure you of our full support and cooperation and wish you every success in discharging your noble duty. likewise, i wish to extend my congratulations to his excellency miroslav laj(:6k for the successful completion of his tenure as president of the 72nd session of the unga. madame president, the 2030 agenda that promises to leave no one behind has encompassed all the prerequisites for us all to build a peaceful and prosperous world. in order to meet this lofty goal of 2030 agenda, the national governments and the international community have to work hand in hand to implement it and it requires international peace and security that would create conducive environment for economic growth and social progress, while enhancing international cooperation and assistance with priorities given to the most vulnerable groups of countries, namely ldcs, lldcs and sids. to realize the 2030 agenda and achieve the sdgs, the lao government has incorporated the sdg targets into its 8th five-year national socio-economic development plan for 2016-2020 soon after the adoption of the agenda 2030. given its specific need, the lao pdr has gone extra mile by adopting the national sdg 18 entitled ""lives safe from unexploded ordnance (iixo)"" to address the problem caused by uxo. at the high-level political forum held in july this year, the lao government presented its first voluntary national review on sdgs l implementation, which saw important progress and emerging constraints over the past years. while positive momentum has been gained on sdgs and ldc graduation, the lao pdrremains vulnerable to external shocks. this year, we are witnessing an increasing intensity of climate change and natural disasters that cause heavy loss and damage to lives and properties of people in different parts of the world. like many countries, the lao pdr is no exception and has been severely affected by natural disaster especially extensive flooding across the country. this is the worst natural disaster ever occurred in the history of our country. to date, 2.409 out of 8.464 villages in 115 out of 148 districts have been affected by massive floods. the exact costs of the loss and damage are yet to be known as post disaster need assessment will be conducted in the very coming months. this calamity has severely caused major impact on the livelihood of the people in the affected areas. currently, the lao government, with assistance from friendly countries, international organizations including ingos and individuals have provided emergency relief to the affected people such as the provision of temporary shelters, food and health care. may i, therefore, take this opportunity to express our heartfelt appreciations and gratitude to the friendly countries and intemational organizations for their valuable assistance provided to us during this difficult time. against this backdrop, it is more crucial than ever for world leaders to honor our commitments pledged in the paris agreement. within asean, great importance is given to the issue of climate change and disaster risk management. we also highly value the un's continued support for asean-iin joint strategic plan of action on disaster management 2016-2020 in addressing the climate change and disaster management and responding to its impacts on socio-economic development in the years to come. 2 madame president, to address the scourge of transnational crime, it requires concerted effort at all levels. in this context, the lao pdr remains highly committed to working closely with the international community in the fights against illicit drug, illegal wild life trade, trafficking in persons, among others. the government has adopted the drug control master plan 2016-2020 as we implement the asean work plan on securing community against illicit drugs 2016-2025 so as to realize the vision of drug free asean as one of high-priority agenda of the region. we are also to support the ""global call to action on the world drug problem"", initiated by the president of the united states. in our fight against human pleased trafficking, the government has spared no effort in combating this heinous and inhumane crime by adopting several laws, regulations and national action plans to combat trafficking in persons and becoming signatory to numerous regional agreements and mous, including the asean convention against trafficking in persons, especially women and children, that seek to prevent and combat human trafficking. madame president, the united nations needs to be strengthened so it can respond effectively to the challenges we face today. we are pleased with the initiatives by the secretary general on reforming and repositioning of the un with the aim to improve un capability to meet the needs in the current environment. in this context, we reiterate our view that development issues must remain at the core, be an integral part and a top priority for the united nations and member states while promoting international peace, security and human rights. while emphasizing the importance of enhancing capacity of the tin system to deliver its mandate, we are concerned 3 about the continued decline of the contribution to the core funding to the un agencies. if this trend continues, it will affect the performance of the un development agencies and development programs on the ground. therefore, my delegation would like to call on donor countries to fuifiil their oda commitment of at least 0.7% of their gni. madame president, we all acknowledge that peace and security are prerequisites for socioeconomic development of all nations. therefore, we need to maintain and promote peace and security x all costs. past experiences have shown that settling disputes by peaceful means is the best way to ensure durable peace that is essential for sustainable development of a nation. as such, it is incumbent upon the international community to fuither build mutual trust and confidence in an effort to jointly overcome the on-going challenges and seek peaceful solutions to the disputes or conflicts that we are witnessing in various regions of the world. against this backdrop, we welcome the recent historic summit between the leaders of the democratic people's republic of korea and the united states of america in june this year which constitutes an importart milestone in the relations between the two countries. we also welcome the 3'd summit between the leaders of the republic of of korea with an objective to korea and the democratic people's republic improve not only bilateral relations between the two countries, but also to address the issue of denuclearization on the korean peninsula. we hope that such positive momentum will be strengthened, thereby, contributing to the maintenance of peace and stability, and denuclearization in the region as a whole. while there is positive development in the korean peninsula, my delegation is of concern on the lack of progress on the palestinian issue. we hope that this 4 long overdue issue on palestine will be resolved by peaceful means in order to achieve a two-state solution where palestine and israel can live side by side in peace, security and within internationally reaognrzed borders as stipulated in the relevant un security council resolutions. on the other note, in the era of interdependence, intemational cooperation and engagement are key factors for peaceful and mutually benefited co-existence. the enforcement of isolation and sanction measures imposed on any country may not bring about benefits to the international community. on the contrary, it will cause a loss for all and lead to increasing hostility. in this regard, my delegation urges that the embargo on the republic of cuba be ended. we would like also to call on the international community to uphold and fuither strengthen multilateralism that will promote cooperation rather than confrontation. this remains one of the core values of our only universal organizalion, the united nations. madame president, i would like to conclude by express my support to the theme for the 73rd session of the unga: making the united nations relevant to all people: globql leadership and shared responsibilities societies, for peaceful, equitable and sustainable it is indeed pertinent to the current global situation and the work of the united nations. however, to make all of the internationally agreed goals and commitments a reality, it requires strong political will and firm commitment and support for multilateralism, particularly to make the united nations stronger than before so that it can effectively serve and respond to the needs of all member states. i thank you. 5","saleumxay kommasith, minister for foreign affairs of the lao people’s democratic

Latvia,"permanent mission of latvia to the united nations 333 east 50"""" street, new york, ny 10022 telephone (1 212) 838-8877 e-mail: mission.un-ny@mfa.gov.lv statement by h.e. mr. edgars rinkevics minister of foreign affairs of the republic of latvia the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly united nations, new york 29 september 2018 madam president, excellencies, distinguished delegates, i wish to congratulate ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces on assuming the post of president of the current session of the general assembly and provide assurances of latvia's full support. i also express gratitude to mr. miroslav lajcak for his active role as president of previous session of the un general assembly. distinguished delegates! i address this assembly in a very special time for my country. this year, latvia is celebrating its centennial. a remarkable change occurred one hundred years ago. the end of world war i and collapse of empires resulted in the liberation of nations and brought about a fundamental revision of europe's political map. a new europe was bom which promised much more than just self-determination, freedom and democracy. the peoples of europe expected lasting peace and prosperity. these objectives were pursued both individually and collectively. peoples' right to self-determination materialized in concrete forms. new nationstates were bom. the paris peace conference laid the foundation for the league of nations. it was the first international organization whose principal mission was to maintain universal peace through the development of binding norms and multilateralism. latvia also joined the league of nations firmly establishing its status as a full-fledged member of the international family. however, the weakness of the league of nations was one of the main reasons why latvia for a time lost its independence. the history of both soviet and nazi occupations of latvia and much of the european continent is a harsh reminder of what happens when serious violations of international law are tolerated. we know all too well the consequences of allowing countries to break these principles with impunity. in latvia's case, it was a life under occupation by nazi and communist regimes of terror and gross violations of human rights. we are grateful to all those nations that for decades implemented policies of non-recognition of the occupation of the republic of latvia and stuck to their principles. in accordance with international law, the state of latvia continued existing throughout the occupation period. however, the russian federation, the official successor of the soviet union still does not acknowledge well-documented facts of history. i call on russia to embrace the truth and to clearly condemn the actions of the soviet union. since the restoration of independence in 1991, latvia has been advocating compliance with international law and human rights. the protection of these principles was needed throughout the transition to a democratic society governed by the rule of law, and in building latvia's role internationally. excellencies! the topic ofthis year's debate invites us to focus on the very heart of the united nations. the charter of the united nations starts with the words ""we the peoples of the united nations"", thus pointing out the aim of the organization to represent rights and interests of every human being on the planet. the united nations was founded not only to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, but also to respect the obligations of international law. human rights, including women's rights and children's rights, are among the most fundamental values of the united nations. the organization must be capable of defending these values in any situation: be it bombing of civilians in syria, massacres of rohingyas in myanmar, persecution of crimean tatars by russian authorities, or other human rights violations wherever they occur. this year, we mark 70 years since the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights. it remains the main global source for inspiration to continue the work to ensure that all people may live with dignity and benefit from the blessings of freedom and equality. security and human rights go hand in hand. security cannot be achieved without respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. a free press has been, and continues to be vital for peace, justice and human rights for all. hence, i once again urge russia to release illegally detained ukrainian filmmaker oleg sentsov who enters day 139 of his hunger strike today. i call on myanmar authorities to free two reuters journalists wa lone and kyaw soe oo. i also call on russia to immediately release other 64 ukrainian political prisoners it has detained including journalist roman sushchenko. i urge nations to adhere to their commitments and obligations under international law and human rights, especially regarding freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, which have notably deteriorated the past year. distinguished delegates! in order to strengthen the role of the united nations, efforts should be made to uphold the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations. in august, the world lost an inspirational leader, a strong advocate for peace and human rights, the former secretarygeneral kofi annan, who argued that ""we will not enjoy security without development, [nor] enjoy development without security, and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights."" the three pillars of the charter are greater than the sum of their individual parts. economic progress and sustainable development are based on a long-term stability, which in turn requires peace and security, and respect for human rights. excellencies! the united nations must be able to change, to undertake serious reforms and therefore to respond to the 2v^ century accordingly. we need a relevant and efficient united nations. latvia welcomes the reforms initiated by the secretary general in the three areas of peace and security, development, and management. it is important that reforms are implemented swiftly. this is a unique organization with a heavy responsibility. the authority of the security council in maintaining international peace and security must be preserved. security council reform is long overdue, and we should all aim for strengthening the legitimacy of this important body. however, stalemate in the security council reform must not impede progress elsewhere. the un reform must include serious improvements in the protection and promotion of human rights. achieving sustainable development through the implementation of the un 2030 agenda cannot be complete without the strengthening of human rights around the world. the human rights council must be strong, effective and must have the ability to quickly react to serious human rights violations in any part ofthe world. latvia is actively engaged in the process of improving the effectiveness of the human rights council. i invite all countries to join this process with an open mind. latvia supports the secretary general's vision and approach for the prevention-focussed united nations. this is even more important given the increasingly complex global security challenges we face. unprevented conflicts and crises around the world drag on for years and decades, destroying human lives, holding back development and draining the resources of the un. 10 the conflicts in syria, and ukraine and yemen continue to take a heavy toll on civilians. we must also not forget about the protracted instability in burundi and afghanistan. the mere length of preventable conflicts undermines the credibility of international organizations, including the united nations. the un security council, as the main guarantor of international peace and security, has a particular responsibility in preventing conflicts, acts of aggression, and mass atrocities. the use of the veto to shield narrow national interests in situations of mass atrocities is totally unacceptable. territorial integrity and sovereignty as enshrined in the purposes and principles of the un charter must be respected by all. the russian federation must stop its aggression against ukraine. latvia together with international community will maintain non-recognition policy concerning the illegal annexation of crimea. 11 i believe that one day international law and justice will prevail, and territorial integrity of ukraine, as well as of other european union's eastern partners, will be restored. the united nations, along with the relevant regional players, must remain involved and committed to resolving protracted conflicts in nagornokarabakh, transnistria, abkhazia and south ossetia. the history ofthe baltic countries is proofofthe moral power of international law and justice. the international community must be more active in solving these issues. no nation was ever secure in isolation. therefore, member states have a responsibility for one another's security. the clear consequences for the aggressor, resolute international pressure and accountability for violations of international law are essential for political resolution of the conflict. a settlement of protracted conflicts in wider europe remains of utmost importance for the international community. 12 reaching the sustainable development goals is the ultimate prevention agenda. they address the drivers and root causes of instability and conflict. investing in human dignity, eradicating poverty, fostering climate resilience and promoting economic and social progress will reduce the incidence of conflict, instability and despair. therefore, the principles ofgood governance, democracy, respect for human rights, gender equality and environmental sustainability guide all latvia's activities of development cooperation. furthermore, gender equality is vital for achieving sustainable development goals. it is an essential precondition for inclusive sustainable development as well as for economic growth and prosperity. 13 distinguished delegates! at the beginning of the 20th century, combatants accounted for 90% of conflict related casualties. today, 90% of casualties in armed conflicts are civilians. conventional arms kill around 500 thousand people per year, out of which 70 thousand are killed in conflict zones. these figures clearly prove that the international community must focus not only on weapons of mass destruction but also on conventional arms. with that in mind latvia assumed the presidency of the arms trade treaty for next year and will spare no effort to promote its objectives. i call on all states to become parties to the arms trade treaty, which would also contribute in a direct way to attainment of the 2030 sustainable development agenda. 14 we must join our efforts to strengthen the principle of multilateralism. in an interdependent and globalized world we can address and resolve global problems only through multilateral means. in this regard, the un stands out as a good global governance instrument, but it is not a global government. the ability ofthe united nations to meet the challenges ofthe present world depends heavily on the decisions of governments and on the support of populations for these decisions. with this, i want to emphasize that the future of multilateralism will depend more on changes in the attitude ofmember states than on reforms of the un system. however, until the fundamental characteristics of the international system are not changed, the un can only strive for higher effectiveness and efficiency. 15 distinguished delegates! we should admit the united nations for what it is. it is not perfect. yet it is very necessary instrument for maintenance of peace, economic development, codification of international law, for a more secure world. the united nations can be and must be a significant global player, a community of nations proud of its values, committed to multilateralism and the principles of international law. the member states must support our organization to project these values worldwide thus affirming its unique role on the global stage. to achieve that purpose the un needs well-functioning norms, efficient institutions and clear vision about its policies. thank you for your attention! 16","edgars rinkēvičs, minister for foreign affairs of latvia, said that the end of first world war marked the birth of a new europe which promised self‑determination, democracy and prosperity for its citizens with the establishment of the league of nations. however, the soviet and nazi occupations of latvia and much of the european continent is a harsh reminder of what happens when serious violations of international law are tolerated. the russian federation, the official successor of the soviet union, still does not acknowledge well‑documented facts of history. he called on that country to embrace the truth and clearly condemn the actions of the soviet union, adding that the protection of human rights was essential to latvia’s transition to a democratic society. the united nations must be capable of defending human rights in any situation, be it the bombing of civilians in syria or the persecution of crimean tartars by the russian authorities, he continued. security and human rights go hand in hand. a free press is vital for peace and justice and he urged the russian federation to release illegally detained ukrainian filmmaker oleg sentsov, who is entering day 139 of his hunger strike today. he also called on myanmar authorities to free the two reuters journalists, wa lone and kyaw soe oo. all nations must adhere to their commitments under international law and human rights, especially regarding freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, which have deteriorated notably during the past year. he voiced his support for the reform process initiated by the secretary‑general in the areas of peace and security, development and management and for those reforms to be implemented swiftly. “this is a unique organization with a heavy responsibility,” he emphasized, observing that security council reform is long overdue. however, that stalemate should not impede progress elsewhere. the human rights council must be strong, effective and capable of reacting quickly to serious human rights violations in any part of the world. latvia is engaged in the process of improving the effectiveness of that council, he said, adding that a prevention‑focused united nations is even more important given that conflicts and crises not prevented tend to drag on for years and decades. no nation was ever secure in isolation, he pointed out, stressing that member states have a responsibility for one another’s security. further, at the beginning of the twentieth century, combatants accounted for 90 per cent of conflict‑related casualties. today, 90 per cent of the casualties are civilians. calling on all states to become parties to the arms trade treaty, he underscored that the future of multilateralism will depend more on changes in the attitudes of member states than on reforms of the organization’s system. “we should admit the united nations for what it is. it is not perfect,” he said. nonetheless, it still remains a very necessary instrument for maintenance of peace, economic development and codification of international laws."
Lebanon,,"michel aoun, president of lebanon, said that the united nations must be the conscience of the world and achieve justice and maintain peace. however, on many occasions the security council has been unable to adopt critical resolutions for certain countries due to the veto right. some countries are not implementing the council’s resolutions, even if those resolutions are binding and immediate. for instance, security council resolution 425 (1978) called on israel to immediately withdraw its troops from the territory of lebanon. that resolution was only implemented after several decades. another resolution adopted by the general assembly in 1948 called for the return of palestinian refugees to their homeland as soon as possible, he continued. that resolution remains unimplemented to this day. the veto right has many reasons for its existence. however, the use of that right has had a negative impact on people around the world. therefore, for the united nations to have an international leadership that is relevant for all, it must be reformed in a way that takes into consideration the expansion of the security council and the increase of its membership. it is also important for the general assembly to reflect the tendencies of the international community, he said. the united nations is also called to enhance human rights around the world. having contributed significantly to the universal declaration of human rights, lebanon has committed to those rights in the introduction and preamble to its constitution. its parliament put forward a law on human rights that included the establishment of a committee that will look into allegations of torture and mistreatment. lebanon is trying to mitigate the effects of conflict, he noted. it was able to eradicate terrorist groups in the rural areas to its north, as well as sleeper cells. it held parliamentary elections in accordance with a law that took into account population percentages and was reflective of all the components of lebanese society. however, it is still facing the consequences of what is happening in syria. there has been an influx of individuals taking refuge in lebanon and his country is trying to provide a decent life for those individuals. yet, the number of syrians in lebanon is rising and it is affecting lebanese communities, notably with an increase in the levels of crime and unemployment. he referred to a 2014 map issued by the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), which shows the increase in the number of syrian displaced persons from 25,000 in 2012 to more than 1 million in 2014. he pointed out that in 2014 the united nations stopped counting the numbers of displaced syrians. there are currently over 1.5 million syrians in lebanon. lebanon seeks to enhance the right for the safe, sustainable return of syrians to their country without any delay. however, it should not be linked to any political settlement when no one knows when that settlement will be reached, he said, adding that, while he rejects the idea of a nationalization project, he welcomes initiatives to address the displacement problem."

ame ic 28 septe be , 2018 your excellency president of the 73rd session of the general assembly, your excellencies heads of state and government, your excellency mr. antonio guterres , secretary general of the united nations, distinguished ladies and gentlemen. allow me at the outset to sincerely congratulate you, madam president, for your well-deserved election as the fourth woman to ascend to the highest seat at the united nations. in as much as we are happy about this reality, we are, however, certainly not proud of our record. out of seventy three (73) general assembly presidents, we only have four that are women to date. nevertheless, all is not lost. we must resolve to walk our talk and ensure that women get the same opportunities as men, in line with the spirit of the un charter. i assure you of my delegation s full support madam president. your impeccable credentials and experience spanning over two decades in the multilateral setting, assure us of a successful 73rd session. it would be remiss of me not to commend your predecessor, h.e. mr. miroslav lajcak, for his distinct leadership in the previous session. i also wish to thank the secretary general for his report on the work of the organization which outlines the state of our united nations. madam presi ent, the world history is replete of incidences of lack of peace since time immemorial. it speaks of conflict between brothers and sisters - wars between and within nations. terrorism and violence have disrupted and displaced families, while economic devastations have torn countless people apart. natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, due to climate change, have taken their toll on humanity. injustice continues to permeate through countries, and societies are left devoid of hope for a prosperous, free, peaceful and just world. as new wars and civil unrests seem to be flaring up every week, our people look up to us as their leaders for solutions, and they yearn for help from the united nations. it is in the above context, madam president, that we welcome the theme for this session; making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful equitable and sustainable societies . the theme speaks to the very principles underpinning the formation of the united nations. the united nations charter puts people at the center of the un with the following words in its preamble: ""we the peoples of the united nations"". the big question today is, have we, for more than seven decades now, put the people at the center of our efforts as an organization? as the session of 51 delegates who came from across the world to adopt the un charter in 1945 came to a conclusion, the then president of the united states, harry truman, said: "" the charter of the united nations which you have just signed is a solid structure upon which we can build a better world...between the victory in europe and the final victory, in this most destructive of all wars, you have won a victory against war itself... with this charter the world can begin to look forward to the time when all worthy human beings may be permitted to live decently as free people for the past 73 years now we have been standing behind this rostrum making commitments and inspiring hope among the citizens of the world. however, our rhetoric has not been matched with actions. our fidelity to the principles enshrined in the un charter remains a concern. seven decades on, we are still embroiled in vicious conflict and violence. a world envisioned by our forebears - a world where worthy human beings may be permitted to live decently as free peopid', continues to elude us. the multilateral system seems to provide no sustainable solution to the multifaceted challenges that confront our world, while unilateralism is on the rise. these challenges put to the test the trust that humanity has on the united nations. their hope that future generations shall be saved from the scourge of war, which has twice in our lifetime brought untold sorrow to humanity , is further receding from sight. madam chair, the above scenario that i have just painted is a reality. even so, the centrality and relevance of the united nations cannot be challenged. the world could not have been the same without the un. imperfect as it might be, its positive impact on the lives of countless people is a fact that cannot be denied. from feeding over 104 million people in over 80 countries every year, to assisting millions of refugees and protecting women and children, to fighting poverty, hiv and aids and to restoring calm through peacekeeping initiatives, the un has undoubtedly made a difference in the lives of global citizens. when addressing this assembly during the 72nd session, i did so with a heavy heart as there was a dark cloud of instability and insecurity hovering over my country. but, today i stand before you to attest to the difference the un can make in people s lives. with the help of the un, sadc, african union (au) and other development partners, we are on the path towards changing the trajectory of a vicious circle of instability and volatile security in lesotho. the kingdom of lesotho is now embarking on a comprehensive national reforms agenda that will culminate with the calibration of pivotal elements of government and thereby achieve the tenets of the national vision 2020. our shared commitment as a nation to transform the mountain kingdom into a just, prosperous and stable country, marked by effective and people-focused institutions; national unity of purpose; rule of law, good governance and human rights, shall be attained. our resolve to build a safe, more stable and secure country is propelled by the fact that peace and security are pre-conditions to development. we are determined to take charge of our socio¬ economic transformation as a country in line with the african union agenda 2063 as well as the un agenda 2030, premised upon the principle of inclusivity and leaving no one behind. we do, however, note the importance that financing plays in any attempt to achieve the goals enshrined in both agenda 2063 and agenda 2030. while we acknowledge that official development assistance (oda) remains a catalyst for development, we also advocate for robust domestic resource mobilization. this is the path that we are venturing on as a country. we are determined to combat illicit financial flows, strengthen tax administration and harness remittances. in line with our national priorities, we are taking substantive steps towards providing an appropriate space for private sector investment and entrepreneurship as a complement to public investments. an industrial hub has been launched in the northern district, which will create job opportunities for about 14,000 people once fully operational, and where private property investors will be invited to build factory shells. we cannot also ignore the disturbing issue of migration. we all know that the movement of persons across borders is a phenomenal issue. it is our considered view that migration is one area in which opportunities for skilled and surplus labor can be explored. to this end, my government is working closely with international partners to achieve developmental outcomes which are related to migration. further to this, a national consultative committee (ncc) was set up to deal with a range of migrationrelated matters including, inter alia; the development of a strategic plan on migration and development. encapsulated in the plans are interventions aimed at enhancing the proper utilization of remittances from the diaspora. we, therefore, need to embrace migrants at the global level on their contribution towards the economic development of both their countries and host countries. we find it disturbing that migrants across the world continue to face challenges of unprecedented magnitude. we call upon all concerned to adhere to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. we look forward to the endorsement of the compact in december of this year. 7 madam chair, peace and prosperity cannot be achieved when women and girls are marginalized and not given the opportunity to contribute to development. the role of women and other disadvantaged sectors of our communities in advancing the global development agenda must be further enhanced. equally important is to underline that the protection of human rights is a noble objective of the international community that must not be politicized, redefined or even subjected to double standards in accordance with the whims and caprices of a few powerful states in pursuit of their individual agenda. on the african continent, we are today, more than ever before, determined to rid ourselves of conflict by settling disputes through peaceful means. the warring parties in south sudan have finally brokered a peace deal. the developments in the horn of africa offer hope for a prosperous and peaceful region. in particular, the normalization of relations between ethiopia and eritrea, through the signing of the peace deal and opening of embassies in those countries' respective capitals, will usher in a new era of peace with concomitant huge economic, humanitarian and strategic implications for the region. 8 we continue to be saddened, however, by the situation in western sahara. western sahara continues to be the only colony on the african continent. the suffering of the saharawi people has been going on for far too long now. they deserve to be afforded an opportunity to voice out their aspirations for independence through an independent and equal suffrage. lesotho shall continue to stand with them in their pursuit for emancipation. while the palestinian people s plight continues to worsen, the hope for the resolution of the crises in syria and iraq continues to diminish. we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of these innocent people. unilateral actions that defy international agreements and the united nations resolutions will only worsen the situation of the palestinians. a two state solution, with palestine and israel living side by side in peace and harmony, remains the only viable option for settlement of the palestine question. attainment of peace is a process that requires engagement, accommodation and genuineness. peace cannot be attained by war or oppression. all of us joined this organization voluntarily and professing love for peace. our actions must, equally, reflect that commitment. in the same vein, the economic and commercial embargo on cuba continues to weigh heavily on our conscience. there is no doubt that this measure has had negative impact on the people and economy of cuba. it is our appeal that the embargo be lifted and cuba be reintegrated into the world trading system. madam president, in today s globalized world, it is indefensible and incomprehensible that decisions which bind us all are left in the hands of a few member states. our advocacy for democratization of the united nations must be intensified. reform of the security council, which takes into account the aspirations of africa, as espoused in the ezulwini consensus, cannot be postponed any longer. transparency, inclusivity and democracy must inform the work of the entire united nations system. equally important is to underscore that the gains made in the field of disarmament are being eroded gradually. small arms and light weapons continue to flood the illegal market. the threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction has re-emerged, and the united nations is left paralyzed due to the size and power configuration of the current security council, making the call for the reform of this body even more urgent. 10 as i conclude, madam president, allow me to indicate that yes, the united nations has to a very large extend attempted to put people at the center of its core business. however, more still needs to be done. my appeal to you all is to shun those who seek to divide and incite us against one another. it is through our solidarity, more than anything else, that the un will thrive and successfully put humanity at the center of its activities. the united nations is the only platform that affords us to embrace true multilateralism. at the same time, let us remember that even though we might have a shared vision and determined leadership to address peace, equity and sustainability challenges, the truth, however, is that we are mortal beings with intellectual and other constraints. as such, we need to acknowledge that there is devine power above from whence emanates true wisdom. let us, therefore, keep our communication lines with god open in order to find real and lasting solutions to the world problems that so often besiege us. i thank you 11","thomas motsoahae thabane, prime minister of lesotho, said the centrality and relevance of the united nations cannot be challenged, from feeding over 104 million people in more than 80 countries annually, assisting millions of refugees, protecting women and children, fighting poverty and hiv and aids, and through peacekeeping. the organization had also worked with the southern african development community (sadc) and african union to help lesotho change its trajectory of instability and volatility and enact a comprehensive national reform agenda. he said his government aims to “transform the mountain kingdom into a just, prosperous and stable country”. he noted the important role of financing to achieve the goals of the african union’s agenda 2063 and agenda 2030. while acknowledging that oda remains a catalyst, he advocated for robust domestic resources mobilization, while providing space for private sector investment. the launch of an industrial hub in the north of lesotho will eventually create 14,000 jobs. turning to migration, he said it offered opportunities to explore skilled and surplus labor. his government is working with international partners and has established a national consultative committee to develop a strategic plan on the issue. he said plans include interventions related to the diaspora, as it is disturbing to see migrants worldwide facing challenges of unprecedented magnitude, and called on the international community to adhere to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. peace and prosperity are impossible when women and girls are marginalized; their role in advancing the global development agenda must be enhanced. it is equally important to avoid politicizing or redefining the protection of human rights or allowing the whims of a few powerful states to subject them to double standards. turning to africa, he said the continent is more determined than ever to settle conflicts peacefully. pointing to the peace deal in south sudan, he noted developments in the horn of africa offer hope for a prosperous, peaceful region. ethiopia and eritrea have normalized relations, opening embassies in their respective capitals to usher in a new era of peace with concomitant economic, humanitarian and strategic implications. however, the situation in western sahara, the only colony in africa, is saddening. lesotho stands with the suffering saharawi people. highlighting worsening situations in syria, iraq and palestine, he called a two‑state solution the only viable option. he also appealed for the embargo on cuba to be lifted, reintegrating the country into the world trading system. stating that it is “indefensible and incomprehensible that decisions which bind us all are left in the hands of a few member states”, he called for reform of the security council

Liberia,"statement his excellency mr. george manneh weak president of the republic of liberia at the 73'^'' session of the united nations general assembly united nations headquarters new york, usa september 26, 2018 h.e. ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the 73*^^ session of the united nations general assembly; h. e. mr. antonio guterres, secretary-general of the united nations; excellencies, delegations; heads of state and government, and heads of distinguished ladies and gentlemen: i am honored to address this 73^^ session of the general assembly of the united nations, on behalf of the government and people of liberia. allow me, first of all, to congratulate you. madam president, and the government and people of ecuador, for your election as president of the 73^^ session of this august assembly. with our eyes on history, liberia takes special note, and hails your selection, as the fourth woman president of the general assembly. let me also express appreciation to secretary-general antonio guterres, whose dynamism and farsighted leadership continues to strengthen the united nations in the face of perennial global challenges. madame president, distinguished ladies and gentlemen: just two weeks ago, we joined millions in ghana and around the world to bid a final farewell to former un secretary-general kofi annan, devoted his life to peacemaking and conflict resolution, a calling at which he was renowned and successful. with his passing, africa has lost one of its most illustrious sons, and the world has lost one of the most outstanding diplomats of our time. may his soul rest in perfect peace. 1 ipa ge madam president, distinguished ladies and gentlemen: late last year, liberians participated in presidential and legislative elections, the results of which represented a major shift in the underlying fundamentals of the liberian political dynamic. in an orderly, lawful, and peaceful manner, liberians voted in overwhelming numbers for a change for hope. this was the first time in 73 years, that liberians enjoyed a peaceful transfer of power from one democratically-elected government to another. at the end of the long campaign, when the results were announced after the run-off, it became clear that the pendulum had swung in the direction of youthful leadership, and that the paradigm had shifted in favor of change and transformation. the united nations and its various bodies, as well as regional organizations and many of our bilateral partners and friends, were direct witnesses to the maturity of the liberian electorate, our respect for law and order, and the successful institutionallzation of the democratic processes. as standard bearer of the winning coalition for democratic change, the mantle and responsibility of leading this transformation therefore devolved upon me, when i was inaugurated as the 24"""" president of liberia on january 22, 2018. the challenges of leadership are enormous, but in each and every one of these challenges, i see opportunities to make things better, and to bring permanent improvements to the lives of all liberians, as we devise policies and programs that will have a lasting and positive impact on the lives of our citizens. 2 i pa ge madam president: the umbrella program under which we intend to pursue prosperity is the pro-poor agenda for development and prosperity (papd), our national development plan for the next five years. this is not an agenda only for the poor; it is for the benefit of all liberians. but it is a policy framework that gives priority to the alleviation of poverty, and its core objective and focus is to reduce the marginalization of the most vulnerable, whilst at the same time creating a conducive atmosphere for the middle and upper income liberian to grow and prosper. we want to build a harmonious society, based on the goal of economic empowerment, especially for the underprivileged. our pro-poor agenda is therefore designed to give power to the people, promote economic diversification, protect sustainable peace and encourage good governance. we appeal to our friends, bilateral partners, and private investors to support this agenda. madame president: as we focus on action plans to implement our development agenda, we are acutely aware of the vulnerability of our youthful population, who are clearly disadvantaged as a result of high unemployment, and a lack of access to quality education opportunities. our plan is to reverse their unfortunate situation and make them productive citizens through the provision of adequate educational facilities at the high school and college levels, for those who still have interest in pursuing academic programs. for those youths left behind due to the disastrous civil crisis and who have outgrown their school years, my government is 3 ipa ge investing in technical vocational education and training programs to build their entrepreneurial and marketable skill-sets. being conscious of the importance and impact of infrastructure on social and economic development, my government has identified investment in roads, energy and ports as our key priority, and is therefore soliciting funding and other technical expertise to undertake these projects in pursuit of our goal to connect our cities and towns, and power our economy. agriculture, liberia's comparative advantage, has also been identified as one of our major poverty-alleviation instruments because it will lead us to self-sufficiency in food production and self-employment, as well as open doors for industrialization. with the implementation of a new special economic zone law, we intend to attract labor-intensive light manufacturing. madame president: drawing from the experience of the 2014 ebola epidemic that took the lives of thousands of liberians and health workers, we intend to efficiently and properly organize our healthcare delivery system, to ensure that the health and wellbeing of our people is improved. finally, we are placing emphasis on national security in order to enable our people move and live freely without fear. with the recent withdrawal of the united nations peace-keeping mission in liberia, we are now in charge of our own security. we thank you for the sacrifices that you have made in securing and maintaining the peace in liberia after our protracted civil conflict. in this regard, we would like to express our personal appreciation to mr. farid zarif of afghanistan who, as special representative for liberia and the last head of the united nations mission in liberia (unmil) from 2015 4 ipa ge to 2018, superintended an orderly withdrawal of troops, while simultaneously securing the peaceful environment that allowed a very robust political campaign to take place without incident. madam president: my country has finally turned the corner, with more years of peace than the preceding years of war, guided by our peace agreement signed in accra 15 years ago. we thank the members and the security council of the united nations for the unmil peacekeeping mission which brought stability and helped us rebuild our institutions and communities. we are a peacekeeping success story, and we are grateful for the support given. but a nation which has experienced civil war must never take peace for granted, or forget the long shadow that years of conflict still cast over people's lives. we must realize and appreciate that ours is still a fragile peace. our people across the country still bear the scars of conflict. we therefore intend to initiate a series of national peace dialogs throughout liberia. we must restart those difficult conversations at the local level, and include our youth, so that they - and we - do not repeat the costly mistakes of the past. it is clear to me that these frank exchanges are an essential step in bringing lasting healing, reconciliation, and unity to our people. our agenda is not one of division, but rather, it is an agenda that intends to provide an enabling environment for a united people to be able to benefit and prosper from the economic dividends of peace. madam president: 5 ipa ge we reaffirm our support to the united nations in striving to achieve global peace and security, good governance and the advancement of the principle of universal human rights. we further reiterate our commitment to the rule of law, the alleviation of poverty, gender equality, the elimination of genderbased violence, and the empowerment of women, girls and young people. liberia, which has been a beneficiary of regional support, knows the relevance of regional solidarity. in this regard we have emphasized the fight against organized crime, especially cross-border trade in illicit substances, and small and light weapons, drugs, human trafficking, piracy and the activities of non-state actors which threaten to undermine peace and security within the ecowas region. madam president; with your support, we will do all we can to make our people feel comfortable at home, and to develop love and respect for one another. we pledge to vigorously work within our regional organizations such as the au, ecowas and the mano river union to foster peace, security, and stability in our region, and for our peoples. i thank you. 6 i pa g e","george manneh weah, president of liberia, hailed ms. espinosa’s successful election, noting that she is one of four women to hold the presidency of the general assembly. paying tribute to the late kofi annan, he said africa lost one of its most illustrious sons and the world one of its most outstanding diplomats. on his country’s newly democratically elected government, he stressed that liberians voted for “a change for hope” and a paradigm shift towards youthful leadership, change and transformation as a first in 73 years. adopting the pro-poor agenda for development and prosperity, he pointed out that this will benefit not just the poor, but all liberians. it is a policy framework for alleviating poverty and reducing the marginalization of the most vulnerable while being conducive for the middle and upper-income liberians to grow and prosper. intending to build a harmonious society, he called on friends, partners and private investors to support the efforts of the pro-poor agenda in giving power to the people, promoting economic diversification, protecting sustainable peace and encouraging good governance. he deplored the vulnerability of the youth in his country who lack access to high quality education and employment opportunities, adding that he plans to make them productive citizens by providing adequate educational facilities at high school and college levels. he also recalled the technical vocational education and training programs for the youth left behind due to the disastrous civil crisis. to connect cities and towns and to power liberia’s economy, he highlighted much needed investments in roads, energy and ports and called therefore for funding and technical expertise. because agriculture is another key priority in alleviating poverty, focus is now on improving self-sufficiency in food production and self-employment, he continued. liberia also intends to attract labor-intensive light manufacturing by implementing a new special economic zone law. he noted that due to the results of the 2014 ebola epidemic costing thousands of liberians’ and health workers’ lives, he plans to better organize the healthcare delivery system to improve the wellbeing of his people. concerning national security and peace, he stressed that his government is in charge of its own security due to the recent withdrawal of the united nations peacekeeping mission in liberia (unmil). he thanked the mission for its sacrifices in securing and maintaining peace. he also expressed his deep gratitude to farid zarif of afghanistan, special representative for liberia and the last head of unmil. liberia is a peacekeeping success story, he said, pointing to the many peaceful years following years of war that were guided by the 2003 accra comprehensive peace agreement. “we must never take peace for granted or forget the long shadows of conflicts on people’s lives,” he underlined, pointing to the national peace dialogs to be initiated."
Libya,,"mohamed t. h. siala, minister for foreign affairs of libya, delivered a statement on behalf of faiez mustafa serraj, president of the presidency council of the government of national accord of the state of libya, who could not be in new york due to the current situation in his country. mr. siala emphasized a need for a coordinated response in efforts to assist libya, requesting that all actors coordinate with the united nations. while the current security landscape is mired with violence and terrorist attacks as libya faced a range of political and economic challenges, he pointed at several gains, including a road map featuring an approach to national reconciliation that would permit the creation of a modern state. overcoming the political deadlock is essential, he continued, commending efforts to find solutions to various challenges. despite the lack of progress on implementing the road map, the government of national accord supports any initiative that promotes a political solution and has engaged in dialog with parties to end the impasse. noting increased numbers of registered voters and the allocation of government funds for elections, he expressed a desire to overcome the crisis. raising several concerns, he condemned attacks in tripoli, calling on concerned parties to respect the current ceasefire, adding that perpetrators will be brought to justice. security and stability are priorities that must be backed by the international community, he said, requesting that the united nations support mission in libya (unsmil) be transformed into one that would help with a response. efforts are being made to stamp out da’esh, whose activities are exploiting libya’s natural resources, he said, adding that subregional, regional and international cooperation must bolster concerted efforts to combat terrorism. for its part, libya has passed a series of laws to ensure national unity and address the country’s many challenges, he continued. but, libya needs assistance to overcome them. emphasizing the need to ensure women’s empowerment, he reiterated the government’s commitment to uphold human rights. as a transit country on the migration route, libya is also trying to resolve related issues, but needs the international community’s help, he said, commending the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to adopt the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. addressing other issues, he said libya stands firm against the use of chemical weapons and for the elimination of nuclear weapons. on development, he said that if nothing changes in terms of current embargo’s asset freeze, libyans will not be able to invest those funds in projects aimed at achieving the 2030 agenda goals. reiterating his government’s call on the security council to amend the sanctions, he pointed out that while the embargo aimed at preserving, the opposite is happening and the assets are eroding. on security council reform, he said equitable representation must be ensured. to correct the marginalization of africa, he called for two permanent seats to be allocated to african states and one for arab states. he also called for international efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and the syrian crisis."
Liechtenstein,"permanent mission of the principality of liechtenstein to the united nations newyork new york1 27 september 2018 un general assembly1 73 rd session general debate statement by h.e. ms. aurelia frick foreign minister of the principality of liechtenstein 633thirdavenue i 27th hoor] newyorkl ny10017/ t +1 (212)599 0220 i f+1 (212)599 0064 i mission@nyc.jlv.ji i www.newyork./iechtenstein.li madame president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen it is a great joy and personal satisfaction to me to see a woman preside over this assembly. it is the tenth time that i have the honor to speak in this historic hal/. and it is the first time in all those years that a woman holds the highest office here at the united nations. i salute your leadership - and we will support you. but it is also disappointing to see that the un - which should be a trailblazer on the empowerment of women - so frequently misses opportunities to make appointments that resonate outside this building. all the more, i thank secretary-general guterres for his commitment to gender parity. his resolve has illustrated that this goal is achievable - and relatively quickly. we have yet to realize full gender equality in practice back home, in liechtenstein. and we will continue looking at the un for setting examples that guide us on our own path. madame president the united nations is the most important peace project the world has ever seen. the un has shaped the way we have lived together for over seven decades. it was created out of the belief that the world could not afford another armed confrontation of the most powerful states, with devastating consequences for everybody. it was created on the basis of a collective system for the maintenance of international peace and security - based on common values and common purposes. 2 the early years of the work of the united nations illustrate the enthusiasm with which states seized the opportunity they had created for themselves. there was a strong focus on the most painful open wounds caused in world war ii. the true dimensions of the horror of the holocaust gradually became public knowledge, not least through the trials in nuremberg. as a result, the genocide convention was adopted. under the vivid impressions of the horrors of hiroshima and nagasaki, the general assembly - in its very first resohrtion s- set the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons. that is a goal we are far from achieving, and the path has so far been rough. but we have finally chartered the way forward -in adopting the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons last year. i congratulate the 17 countries which have already ratified the treaty. we will do our best to follow suit. the united nations has also been the place where we developed human rights standards - the rules that guide the relationship between the state and the human person, individually and collectively. the universal declaration of human rights was at the beginning of this inspiring trajectory. eleanore roosevelt, one . of my personal rolernodels, made a decisive contribution to its conclusion. 70 years later, there can be no question that every individual on this planet is entitled to enjoy all the rights reflected in it. an impressive number of groundbreaking treaties were built on this basis - a very proud record. more than anything else, the human rights area reflects the spirit of the un charter­ written on behalf of the peoples, not governments. 3 development became another key mission in this building. in fact, for many in the membership, the united nations is the most important platform in this respect. this as well is an agenda that we shaped together - we agreed on the right to development. and we made it clear that development, hu man rights and peace and security belong together. the coronation of this effort are the sustainable development goals that will guide our work until 2030. they offer a historic opportunity. we owe it to our children not to miss it. the challenge of climate change illustrates perfectly clear that the united nations is the indispensable organization. we ourselves have created a threat to our sheer existence - as the human race, as individuals. this threat knows no national borders, makes no distinction. we are all equally affected. we can only overcome it together. our very survival is at stake. and yet, we are significantly behind what is necessary to do. the secretary-general is right to sound the alarm. it is his responsibility. it is up to us - all of us - to act. madame president all of this can only lead to one conclusion: we need more united nations, not iess > more effective, more cooperative, more dynamic, more in tune with the times we live in. and yet, we are distracted iii this effort. there are tendencies to revert to a paradigm that led to enormous suffering in the past - and would certainly be disastrous today. willful blindness, ignoring the realities, denying the facts and appealing to fear and resentment are recipes for disaster. we have witnessed a downward spiral in this conversation. it has been rapid and led us to 4 a point today where the fundamentals of what we have created together are under attack. madame president the charter is our main reference point when we reflect on the most pressing challenges of today. the following paragraph from the preamble stands out this year: ""we the peoples of the united nations determined ... to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained"". today more than ever, we are challenged in our determination to do just this. today, we can . no longer take it for granted that these conditions exist. the questioning of international agreements and norms in the areas of trade, climate change, disarmament, migration, human rights has one common thread: it undermines not just the contents of those agreements. it is an attack on the rules-based order as such. it runs contrary to the pledge that we are all committed to under the un charter: respect for obligations under international law. madame president overwhelming support for the international rules based order has been expressed in the course of this debate. this gives us hope and inspiration to tackle the challenges we are facing. to be clear: we need to work harder to make the un fit for purpose. most importantly, we still have a security council that is least functional when it is most needed. while addressing our weaknesses we must also make better use of our strengths, in particular the 5 power of this assembly. it has the legal and political authority to build institutions and set policies that are game changers. madame president one such institution is the accountability mechanism for syria. we were proud to lead the way to the creation of the 111m two years ago. born out of the frustration over the deadlock in the security council, it has quickly become a symbol of what this assembly can achieve - and a beacon of hope for syria. at this critical moment in the syrian conflict, our resolve to ensure accountability for the crimes committed will shape the future of the country. a very different situation confronts us with a similar massive accountability challenge: the atrocities committed against the rohingya population by the authorities in myanmar are shocking to all of us. there can be no voluntary return of the hundreds of thousands forcibly displaced into bangladesh unless we ensure a credible accountability process. we now have a direct path to justice, because the international criminal court has ruled that it can exercise jurisdiction over the crime of forced deportation. this creates a new and expeditious policy option for the 123 states among us which have joined the rome statute: we can come together and refer the situation in cox's bazaar to the icc. i hope that this conversation will take place here in new york over the next few weeks. madame president 6 from syria to myanmar to venezuela, the international criminal court is at the center of the effort to fight impunity. its creation 20 years ago was perhaps the most important advance in the recent history of international law. it fulfilled a vision that had eluded us for a century. and today, it is an institution that is imperfect --'"" but more importantly: it is indispensable. it is telling that at a time of a generic questioning of a rules-based order, the icc finds itself under particular attack, from different sides. more than ever, we need this court. and more than ever, we must be ready to stand up for it. madame president the issue of modern slavery and human trafficking is one that is particularly disturbing to the liechtenstein government. seventy years ago, in the universal declaration of human rights, we agreed that iino one shall be held in slavery or . servitude"". today, over 40 million people, predominantly women and girls, live in these conditions. this is unacceptable. we have joined forces with our partners from australia and from unu and created the financial sector commission (fsc). its task is to design a response for actors in the financial sector to help eliminate modern slavery and to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. i am proud to serve-as the co-convenor of this commission, together with nobel peace laureate muhammad yunus. we are under no illusion about the magnitude of the task. but we are encouraged that the 2030 agenda has created such a strong impetus to finally eliminate slavery. we stand ready to take this opportunity, together with all of you. thank you. 7","aurelia frick, foreign minister of liechtenstein, said that while it is a “great joy” to see a woman preside over the assembly, it is also disappointing to see the united nations so frequently miss the opportunity to make appointments that resonate outside the building. turning to climate change, she said: “we ourselves have created a threat to our sheer existence — as the human race, as individuals.” climate change knows no national borders. “our very survival is at stake. and yet, we are significantly behind what is necessary to do,” she added, underscoring that the secretary‑general is right to sound the alarm. “we need more united nations, not less — more effective, more cooperation, more dynamic, more in tune with the times we live in,” she continued. wilful blindness, ignoring the realities, denying the facts and appealing to fear and resentment are recipes for disaster. the questioning of international agreements and norms in the areas of trade, climate change, disarmament, migration and human rights have one common threat. it undermines not just the contents of those agreements; it is also an attack on rules‑based order. expressing concern that the security council is “least functional when it is most needed”, she stressed the need to ensure accountability for the crimes committed in syria. for the atrocities committed against the rohingya population, the international criminal court offers a path to justice. from syria to myanmar to venezuela, the court is at the center of the effort to fight impunity. and yet, it continues to be attacked from different sides. “more than ever, we need this court,” she stressed. she further expressed concern over the issue of modern slavery and human trafficking, noting that over 40 million people, mostly women and girls, live in servitude. liechtenstein has joined forces with australia and others to help eliminate modern slavery and to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. the 2030 agenda is a step in the right direction to finally eliminate slavery."
Lithuania,"statement by the president of the republic of lithuania dalia grybauskaite at the general debate of the united nations general assembly 27 september 2018, new york ladies and gentlemen, this november the world will remember 100 years since the end of the first world war. it caused the fall of empires and opened a window for small nations in europe, including lithuania, to achieve their dream to live independent and free, enjoying their culture and traditions. to prevent such war from ever happening again, multilateral institutions were created to safeguard political independence and territorial integrity. yet when the world faced its next big crisis, these institutions failed to act and remained powerless bystanders as humanity plunged into another world war. today we wish to think that our multilateral institutions, including these united nations, are strong enough to take a stand against aggression and disregard of international rules. yet sometimes reality tells a different story. we see the world that is more fractured and institutions that are crumbling instead of sheltering us from the use of force and economic storms. in almost every major crisis of the last decade - from syria to ukraine, from myanmar to yemen - the un security council was unable to play a meaningful role because of inability of states to rise above their national interests and obstructive use of veto. organizations created to abolish weapons of mass destruction are toothless against dictators who develop nuclear arms and use chemical weapons on civilians in our cities. as the tide begins to turn for the global economy, the world trade organization is facing paralysis. rising global trade tensions could wipe away our achievements in sustainable development and poverty reduction. at the same time, we must recognize that our institutions are not perfect. t ey can be bureaucratic, wasteful and unaccountable. but it was us, member states, who created them, so it is up to us to improve and adapt them to new realities. before we seek to destroy multilateral institutions, commitments and agreements, we must know what we want to build instead. otherwise, we will end up living on the pile of ruins. we cannot reject globalization, because fighting it will only make us poorer. in the last 25 years, free trade gave more than 1 billion people an opportunity to escape extreme poverty. however, globalization also has a dark side, which must be confronted by acting against exclusion, inequality and falling labor standards. we cannot let the voices of nationalism and division win over dialog and cooperation. on all major challenges - terrorism, climate change and achieving women empowerment - there is simply no alternative to working together. so far, we have been too quiet, too passive, too ignorant. we must stop taking an easy way out blaming institutions for our domestic failures. we must recognize that we, the member states, have the power and resources to enable united nations to stand up for freedom, equality and humanity. because we are the un, so let s take responsibility for our future, empowering the un to act. thank you.","dalia grybauskaité, president of lithuania, noted that this year the world marks the centenary of the end of the first world war, a war that caused the fall of empires and gave small nations in europe the chance to achieve independence. following the end of the war, multilateral institutions were created to safeguard political independence and territorial integrity. however, the failure of those institutions plunged the world into the second world war. people today think multilateral institutions, including the united nations, are strong enough to take a stand against aggression and the disregard of international rules, she said. however, reality sometimes tells a different story. the world is increasingly fractured, and institutions fail to shelter those they represent from economic storms. the security council has been unable to play a meaningful role in resolving almost every major conflict of the past decade, she pointed out, attributing the failure to the inability of states to rise above their national interests and the obstructive use of veto powers. organizations created to abolish weapons of mass destruction are toothless against dictators who develop nuclear arms and use chemical weapons on civilians. the tides are changing for the global economy, she said, adding that the world trade organization is facing paralysis. rising trade tensions may wipe away progress made towards achieving sustainable development and poverty reduction. multilateral institutions are not perfect;

Luxembourg,,"xavier bettel, prime minister of luxembourg, said a retreat in multilateralism can be seen on many fronts. however, in democracies, multilateralism and respect for the rule of law act as guarantees for nations to play a role at the international level. the same is true on the economic landscape, where measures and counter-measures can jeopardize growth for all, he said, encouraging a return to negotiations and constructive engagement under wto auspices to avoid a situation where all actors suffered losses. similarly, challenges such as migration require solutions at the global level, he continued, expressing hope such a formula will be found during the intergovernmental conference to adopt the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. highlighting that the european union is now creating mechanisms for member states to address the issue of welcoming refugees, he said luxembourg has been engaged in efforts to welcome asylum-seekers, adding that clear distinctions have been made between political refugees and economic migrants. on climate change, he supported the secretary-general’s urgent calls to follow through on the paris agreement for the sake of future generations. voicing support for related efforts, he underlined the significance of the 2030 agenda, which acts as a guide to mobilize the international community. however, financing sustainable development efforts has been problematic. despite the creation of specific mechanisms at the international and national level aimed at mobilizing the private sector, more must be done. to address that issue, luxembourg created a “green grant” and is working on tools tailored towards meeting other sustainable development objectives. yet, development contributions are falling, he said, emphasizing the need to diversify sources of aid and noting luxembourg’s contributions of 1 per cent of its gdp. expressing support for the secretary-general’s development and security sector reform efforts, he raised some of the challenges concerning the latter. noting that africa hosted the most peacekeeping operations, he said the sahel region is a corridor of instability and coordinated efforts must work towards overcoming problems there. highlighting luxembourg’s support and contributions for various united nations missions, he raised concerns about crises elsewhere, including the impasse in the israeli-palestinian peace process and the explosive situation in libya. the syrian war, with reports of chemical weapons use and humanitarian crises, was another grave concern, as was the worsening situation in yemen, he said, noting that regional actors are playing key roles in both cases. on disarmament developments, he expressed hope that talks between the democratic people’s republic of korea and the united states will lead to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula. regretting to note a tendency to move towards unilateral action in certain situations and a crumbling of respect for human rights, he pointed to cases in myanmar involving the rohingya community and called on the human rights council to address those concerns. human rights covered a broad range, including sexual and reproductive rights, he said, citing his country’s support for related projects worldwide. reiterating the benefits of multilateralism in rising to the challenges of globalization, he said a return to a narrow notion of national has never been an option for luxembourg and today it is no longer an option for any member state."
Madagascar,,"rivo rakotovao, president ad interim of madagascar, underscored the great changes in the world: multi-polarity and economic globalization with dizzying levels of computerization as well as abundant diversity. “much progress has been made,” he said, but added that there are a lack of confidence and insecurity, exacerbated by inequality and planetary challenges such as climate change, poverty and disease. everyone was a witness to the humanitarian crises in the world, as the world is changing and evolving. the united nations must adapt to ensure coherence in responses and approaches. achieving the sustainable development goals requires combating inequality and promoting social inequality. in addition, it is essential to protect the environment, which must be a priority if the international community wants to eliminate extreme poverty and ensure the viability of the planet. he noted the role of women and girls, and the appalling conditions they are facing all over the world, including as victims of gender‑based violence. “women and girls are central to the future of humanity,” he said, adding that to improve the fate of humanity, everyone must care about the fate of women. continuing, he called for action to improve health care around the world too, particularly in africa. he pointed to problems in madagascar especially in obtaining specific investment commitments and support from partners. he noted that a universal health care system has been implemented and the country is now free of polio. the country’s 2030 agenda ensures inclusive sustainable development, but adequate financial resources are vital to galvanize the support it needs, he said. underscoring that a world of peace and prosperity must have consensual actions that are decided by everyone, he noted that the malagasy people have been interested in partnerships to protect the country’s democratic achievements, which are essential to its stability. the country is at a crossroads. he quoted kofi annan, who said: “no nation is born democratic,” and added that madagascar has the determination to build democracy. he noted accomplishments of the last four years, including macroeconomic balance, as well as increased confidence between national and international stakeholders. he pointed to more positive steps, such as the use of clean energy – and the building of hydro and solar plants, which will reduce electricity costs by 2020 despite oil price increases. exports are doing well and in the social sector, health care has improved. he noted other sectors’ improvements: tourism, infrastructure, airports, and structural reform to counter corruption — all of which would advance stability and growth. lastly, he reiterated the call to promote a better future to which all nations aspire, and paid tribute to former secretary‑general kofi annan, defender of multilateralism, who sought to build a stronger organization on behalf of humanity."
Malawi,"republic of malawi address by his excellency professor arthur peter mutharika, president of the republic of malawi at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly new york, 25th september, 2018 1 a quest for global peace: including africa this assembly is a representation of humanity in its fullness. therefore, madame president, congratulations! your ascendance to this seat reminds us that there are no minorities in this organization. and we are proud to see the united nations led by a woman of your repute and intellectual prowess. congratulations! ten days ago, madame president, africa lost a malawian who was our first ambassador to this assembly of the united nations. david rubadiri was a conscience of the african continent, and a pan-african poet who was adopted by east africa as their son. one month ago, madame president, the world lost an african who was the second general secretary from africa to the united nations. kofi annan was an african inspiring spirit of the world. kofi anan was a voice of peace, a voice of the voiceless, the conscience and moral arbiter of the world. he decisively carried forward the flag of peace amidst turmoil when some of us were busy declaring war on peace. today, i stand to urge this assembly to raise high that flag of peace that my brother kofi anan stood for. i urge this assembly to rise and march forward in that spirit of defending peace. 2 peace is a universal human desire. we all desire peace. it must be diligently sought by us all. peace is precious. peace is delicate. it must be jealously guarded by us all. we cannot sit here as a proud assembly while out there— human communities are being driven out of their homes, forced to abandon their countries and condemned to unknown destinies of homeless survival. every human needs a home. we cannot be a proud humanity when out there - innocent children, voiceless men and vulnerable women are suffering and being killed. every life is precious. history will measure our global leadership and the legacy of this organization on the scales of how we defend the defenseless, feed the hungry, and empower the weak. history will judge our generation on how we defend human life and protect this endangered planet. therefore, it is our shared responsibility to seek peace in all its forms; to defend peace; and to reach out to reason with those who declare war on peace. madame president, the relevance of this organization rests on our ability to satisfy the needs of the people across the world. this includes africa as i will argue in my conclusion. 3 let us never doubt! the pursuit of shared responsibility implies collective inclusion. every nation is important. and we all have something to offer. that is why i began my address by reminding this assembly that there are no minorities here. there are no small nations here. there are only nations in the united nations. of course, let us admit that there will always be economic inequality of nations. and yes, we all have something to offer to humanity. but those with more resources and power must step out to offer more. let us remember! power is not status. power is responsibility. leadership is not prestige. leadership is responsibility. we must define global leadership in terms of global responsibility. madame president, excellencies we are prepared to fulfill our responsibility and obligations in the global community. malawi remains committed to the ideals of the united nations. malawi ascribes to values of democratic governance, peace and security. we remain committed to participating in the efforts for maintaining international peace and security. malawi remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights. we remain committed to participating in international cooperation to resolve challenges that face human societies. 4 malawi acknowledges the sacrifices being made by the “blue helmets”. the composition of the “blue helmets” demonstrates our commitment of the united nations to the principle of inclusion of nations of all regions. we are proud to be an active member in the un peace-keeping operations across the world. for us, defending peace is a precious sacrifice. malawi has served in peace-keeping missions in darfur, lesotho, and côte d’ivoire. as i speak, we are part of the un peace-keeping operations in the democratic republic of congo. in our pursuit to promote peace, justice and effective institutions, let me announce that the 2019 high level forum on sdg 16 will convene in malawi. i welcome the opportunity and honor to host this forum. i believe this event will be a significant catalyst in our resolve to achieve sdg 16. madame president, excellencies malawi supports the united nations determination to galvanize international cooperation in promoting socio-economic development. we are committed to the agenda 2030 for sustainable development goals (sdgs). we support the un priorities of eradicating poverty and hunger in all its forms and dimensions. the un priorities are malawi’s priorities. and 5 we will never relent until we have accomplished the whole hierarchy of our priorities. we are proud of our efforts and achievements in maternal health; girl’s education; youth empowerment; and gender equality. but the plight of refugees and migrants is a concern to the people of malawi. as malawians, we believe refugees are part of our one human family. we believe in our collective responsibility to ensure refugees’ protection, safety and access to refuge. as a result, malawi has been hosting refugees for some decades now. let me also report that malawi received a high-level unhcr delegation this year. we are actively part of the initiative to develop a comprehensive refugee response framework (crrf), which member states agreed upon. we have developed the concept for the framework, which is to be rolled out in malawi within our national development strategy and our cooperation agreement with the united nations. on another note, malawi is both a victim and a fighter of climate change. the consequences of climate change are real, devastating and often tragic in large scale proportions. for this reason, i would like to urge all governments, business leaders, investors and civil society to fight for the bending the curve of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and meeting the goals of the paris agreement. let us move to accelerate the green transition and create more jobs, provide sustainable transport, and clean energy systems. malawi is 6 doing its part by implementing various disaster risk reduction and resilience building initiatives. but we cannot do it alone. we need adequate, predictable and sustainable sources of climate financing such as the green climate fund in order to support our actions. let me also report that my government is endeavoring to eliminate hunger and malnutrition by 2030. given the hostile consequences of climate change, food insecurity and malnutrition are serious threats in a country that still relies on subsistence rain-fed agriculture. we believe that inclusive and resilient economic growth is key to overcoming hunger and reducing poverty. in this regard, we have in the past four years relentlessly pursued macro-economic measures that are now improving malawi’s economy. we have stabilized the economy within four years in spite of the natural disasters of floods, drought and hunger that hit malawi for two consecutive years. within four troubled years, we have reduced inflation from 24 per cent to single digit. we have reduced interest rates from 25 per cent to 16 per cent. we have taken our import cover from the lowest point to the highest point in our economic history. our import cover has risen from below 2 months to 6 months. we have made local currency stable and predictable. above all, i found gdp growth rate at 2.4 per cent when i started leading malawi four years ago. now we expect growth 4 per cent in our 7 2018/2019 financial year. and we expect this growth to rise to 6 percent in 2019. we are improving these macro-economic because a bad economy is injustice to its citizens. at the same time, we continue focusing on the justice of specific sectors of our society. we are fighting against violence against women and girls. i believe no human society can meaningfully develop while marginalizing its women. development must always be inclusive. with support from the united nations and other development partners, particularly the european union (eu), malawi will from 2019 implement the spotlight initiative in a bid to eliminate violence against women and girls. again, no society can progress without its youth. malawi is therefore implementing a number of youth programs. this includes a skills development program that involves establishing community technical colleges. we are empowering the youth with skills for them to create jobs and businesses for themselves and others. we believe no society can develop without a skilled labor force. our urgent need is to train the trainers in this youth program. let me also add that malawi believes that citizens of every nation must have legal identities. malawi has fulfilled this principle. today, over 95 percent of my people aged 16 and above have national identity cards. 8 and we are in the process of integrating the national id to be used in education, finance, agriculture, security, social welfare and other public services. madame president, excellencies malawi will always play the team member of the international community. we support the un initiatives in fighting global systemic threats and challenges, including terrorism, and climate change. we support the un development system (unds) reforms. as such, malawi welcomes the adoption of:a) resolution a/72/279 on the repositioning of the un development system; and b) resolution a/72/305 on review of the implementation of general assembly resolution 68/1 to strengthen the economic and social council. we strongly support the common african position calling for 2 permanent seats with veto and 5 non–permanent seats for africa. why should some nations be afraid of losing power by offering decision making space to africa when you don’t lose power by accommodating 9 other continents? is africa that much of a threat? this segregation of africans must come to an end. why should we allow this organization to be accused of hypocrisy - that we preach democracy everywhere when we are not democratic enough to accommodate almost one third of our own membership in this assembly? madame president, let me conclude by commending the ironical wisdom in the theme we chose this year. let us prove that we can live up to the demands of this theme. and i speak for africa! we cannot talk about shared responsibility while we marginalize africans and deny them full participation in our decisions. we cannot talk about global leadership of the united nations when african leadership is not on the decision-making tables. in any political system, we cannot claim relevance to the people that we deny. a time has come to make the united nations relevant to all people. a time has come to show global leadership that is inclusive of all nations. a time has come to pledge shared responsibilities together with africa and the rest of the world. and a time has come for this assembly to listen to the voice of africa. let us listen…! i thank you for your attention. 10","arthur peter mutharika, president of malawi, urged the general assembly to raise the flag of peace in honor of former secretary-general kofi annan, asserting that peace must be guarded by all. the assembly cannot stand proud while people around the world are forced to abandon their countries and while innocent children, women and men are being killed. every human needs a home, every life is precious, he asserted, adding that there is a shared responsibility to seek and defend peace. he said the relevance of the united nations rests on its ability to satisfy the needs of people across the world, including africans. every nation is important and every nation has something to offer. however, those with more resources and power must step up and offer more. global leadership must be defined in terms of global responsibility and malawi is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations, he said. he acknowledged the sacrifices being made by united nations peacekeepers and expressed pride in malawi’s active membership in peacekeeping operations, including ongoing efforts in the democratic republic of the congo. he said malawi supports united nations efforts to galvanize international cooperation in promoting socioeconomic development and remains committed to the 2030 agenda. the priorities of the united nations are also malawi’s priorities. the plight of refugees and migrants is a concern to the people of malawi, he said, expressing his belief in the collective responsibility to ensure the protection of refugees. malawi is actively part of a united nations initiative to develop a comprehensive refugee response framework to be rolled out within its national development strategy. turning to climate change, he said its consequences are real, devastating and often tragic and urged all relevant actors to fight for the bending of the curve of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. he said malawi is endeavoring to eliminate hunger and malnutrition by 2030 and that inclusive economic growth is essential to reducing poverty. malawi’s economy has stabilized with inflation having been reduced from 24 per cent to the single digits and with its gdp expected to grow by 6 per cent in 2019. he said malawi supports united nations reform efforts, including the call for two permanent, veto-holding seats for african states in the security council. the united nations cannot preach democracy while it itself is unrepresentative, he said, calling for the organization to be relevant to all people."
Malaysia,"statement by yab prime minister of malaysia tun dr mahathir bin mohamad at the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly (unga) 28 september 2018, new york **************************************************** madam president, 1. i would like to join others in congratulating you on your election as the president of the seventy-third (73rd) session of the united nations general assembly (unga). 2. i am confident with your wisdom and vast experience; this session will achieve the objectives of the theme for this session. i assure you of malaysia‟s fullest support and cooperation towards achieving these noble goals. 3. allow me to also pay tribute to your predecessor, his excellency miroslav lajcak, for his dedication and stewardship in successfully completing the work of the 72nd session of the general assembly. 4. i commend the secretary-general and the united nations staff for their tireless efforts in steering and managing un activities globally. 5. in particular, i pay tribute to the late kofi annan, the seventh secretary-general of the un from 1997 – 2006, who sadly passed away in august this year. malaysia had a positively strong and active engagement with the un during his tenure. 1 madam president, 6. the theme of this 73rd session of general assembly, “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” remains true to the aspiration of our founding fathers. the theme is most relevant and timely. it is especially pertinent in the context of the new malaysia. the new government of malaysia, recently empowered with a strong mandate from its people, is committed to ensure that every malaysian has an equitable share in the prosperity and wealth of the nation. 7. a new malaysia emerged after the 14th general election in may this year. malaysians decided to change their government, which had been in power for 61 years, i.e., since independence. we did this because the immediate past government indulged in the politics of hatred, of racial and religious bigotry, as well as widespread corruption. the process of change was achieved democratically, without violence or loss of lives. 8. malaysians want a new malaysia that upholds the principles of fairness, good governance, integrity and the rule of law. they want a malaysia that is a friend to all and enemy of none. a malaysia that remains neutral and non-aligned. a malaysia that detests and abhors wars and violence. they also want a malaysia that will speak its mind on what is right and wrong, without fear or favor. a new malaysia that believes in co-operation based on mutual respect, for mutual gain. the new malaysia that offers a partnership based on our philosophy of „prosper-thy-neighbor‟. we believe in the goodness of cooperation, that a prosperous and stable neighbor would contribute to our own prosperity and stability. 9. the new malaysia will firmly espouse the principles promoted by the un in our international engagements. these include the principles of truth, human rights, the rule of law, justice, fairness, responsibility 2 and accountability, as well as sustainability. it is within this context that the new government of malaysia has pledged to ratify all remaining core un instruments related to the protection of human rights. it will not be easy for us because malaysia is multi-ethnic, multireligious, multicultural and multilingual. we will accord space and time for all to deliberate and to decide freely based on democracy. madam president, 10. when i last spoke here in 2003, i lamented how the world had lost its way. i bemoaned the fact that small countries continued to be at the mercy of the powerful. i argued the need for the developing world to push for reform, to enhance capacity building and diversify the economy. we need to maintain control of our destiny. 11. but today, 15 years later the world has not changed much. if at all the world is far worse than 15 years ago. today the world is in a state of turmoil economically, socially and politically. 12. there is a trade war going on between the two most powerful economies. and the rest of the world feel the pain. 13. socially new values undermine the stability of nations and their people. freedom has led to the negation of the concept of marriage and families, of moral codes, of respect etc. 14. but the worse turmoil is in the political arena. we are seeing acts of terror everywhere. people are tying bombs to their bodies and blowing themselves up in crowded places. trucks are driven into holiday crowds. wars are fought and people beheaded with short knives. acts of brutality are broadcast to the world live. masses of people risk their lives to migrate only to be denied asylum, sleeping in the open and freezing to death. thousands starve and tens of thousands die in epidemics of cholera. 3 15. no one, no country is safe. security checks inconvenience travelers. no liquids on planes. the slightest suspicion leads to detention and unpleasant questioning. 16. to fight the “terrorists” all kinds of security measures, all kinds of gadgets and equipment are deployed. big brother is watching. but the acts of terror continues. 17. malaysia fought the bandits and terrorists at independence and defeated them. we did use the military. but alongside and more importantly we campaigned to win the hearts of minds of these people. 18. this present war against the terrorist will not end until the root causes are found and removed and hearts and minds are won. 19. what are the root causes? in 1948, palestinian land was seized to form the state of israel. the palestinians were massacred and forced to leave their land. their houses and farms were seized. 20. they tried to fight a conventional war with help from sympathetic neighbors. the friends of israel ensured this attempt failed. more palestinian land was seized. and israeli settlements were built on more and more palestinian land and the palestinians are denied access to these settlements built on their land. 21. the palestinians initially tried to fight with catapults and stones. they were shot with live bullets and arrested. thousands are incarcerated. 22. frustrated and angry, unable to fight a conventional war, the palestinians resort to what we call terrorism. 23. the world does not care even when israel breaks international laws, seizing ships carrying medicine, food and building materials in international waters. the palestinians fired ineffective rockets which hurt no one. massive retaliations were mounted by israel, rocketing 4 and bombing hospitals, schools and other buildings, killing innocent civilians including school children and hospital patients. and more. 24. the world rewards israel, deliberately provoking palestine by recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel. 25. it is the anger and frustration of the palestinians and their sympathizers that cause them to resort to what we call terrorism. but it is important to acknowledge that any act which terrify people also constitute terrorism. and states dropping bombs or launching rockets which maim and kill innocent people also terrify people. these are also acts of terrorism. 26. malaysia hates terrorism. we will fight them. but we believe that the only way to fight terrorism is to remove the cause. let the palestinians return to reclaim their land. let there be a state of palestine. let there be justice and the rule of law. warring against them will not stop terrorism. nor will out-terrorizing them succeed. 27. we need to remind ourselves that the united nations organization, like the league of nations before, was conceived for the noble purpose of ending wars between nations. 28. wars are about killing people. modern wars are about mass killings and total destruction countrywide. civilized nations claim they abhor killing for any reason. when a man kills, he commits the crime of murder. and the punishment for murder may be death. 29. but wars, we all know encourage and legitimize killing. indeed the killings are regarded as noble, and the killers are hailed as heroes. they get medals stuck to their chest and statues erected in their honor, have their names mentioned in history books. 30. there is something wrong with our way of thinking, with our value system. kill one man, it is murder, kill a million and you become a hero. and so we still believe that conflict between nations can be resolved with war. 5 31. and because we still do, we must prepare for war. the old adage says “to have peace, prepare for war”. and we are forever preparing for war, inventing more and more destructive weapons. we now have nuclear bombs, capable of destroying whole cities. but now we know that the radiation emanating from the explosion will affect even the country using the bomb. a nuclear war would destroy the world. 32. this fear has caused the countries of europe and north america to maintain peace for over 70 years. but that is not for other countries. wars in these other countries can help live test the new weapons being invented. 33. and so they sell them to warring countries. we see their arms in wars fought between smaller countries. these are not world wars but they are no less destructive. hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, whole countries devastated and nations bankrupted because of these fantastic new weapons. 34. but these wars give handsome dividends to the arms manufacturers and traders. the arms business is now the biggest business in the world. they profit shamelessly from the deaths and destructions they cause. indeed, so-called peace-loving countries often promote this shameful business. 35. today‟s weapons cost millions. fighter jets cost about 100 million dollars. and maintaining them cost tens of millions. but the poor countries are persuaded to buy them even if they cannot afford. they are told their neighbors or their enemies have them. it is imperative that they too have them. 36. so, while their people starve and suffer from all kinds of deprivations, a huge percentage of their budget is allocated to the purchase of 6 arms. that their buyers may never have to use them bothers the purveyors not at all. madam president, 37. in myanmar, muslims in rakhine state are being murdered, their homes torched and a million refugees had been forced to flee, to drown in the high seas, to live in makeshift huts, without water or food, without the most primitive sanitation. yet the authorities of myanmar including a nobel peace laureate deny that this is happening. i believe in non-interference in the internal affairs of nations. but does the world watch massacres being carried out and do nothing? nations are independent. but does this mean they have a right to massacre their own people, because they are independent? madam president, trade 38. on the other hand, in terms of trade, nations are no longer independent. free trade means no protection by small countries of their infant industries. they must abandon tariff restrictions and open their countries to invasion by products of the rich and the powerful. yet the simple products of the poor are subjected to clever barriers so that they cannot penetrate the market of the rich. malaysian palm oil is labeled as dangerous to health and the estates are destroying the habitat of animals. food products of the rich declare that they are palm oil free. now palm diesel are condemned because they are decimating virgin jungles. these caring people forget that their boycott is depriving hundreds of thousands of people from jobs and a decent life. 39. we in malaysia care for the environment. some 48% of our country remains virgin jungle. can our detractors claim the same for their own countries? 7 madam president, 40. malaysia is committed to sustainable development. we have taken steps, for example in improving production methods to ensure that our palm oil production is sustainable. by december 2019, the malaysian sustainable palm oil (mspo) standard will become mandatory. this will ensure that every drop of palm oil produced in malaysia will be certified sustainable by 2020. madam president, 41. all around the world, we observe a dangerous trend to inward-looking nationalism, of governments pandering to populism, retreating from international collaborations and shutting their borders to free movements of people, goods and services even as they talk of a borderless world, of free trade. while globalization has indeed brought us some benefits, the impacts have proven to be threatening to the independence of small nations. we cannot even talk or move around without having our voices and movement recorded and often used against us. data on everyone is captured and traded by powerful nations and their corporations. 42. malaysia lauds the un in its endeavors to end poverty, protect our planet and try to ensure everyone enjoys peace and prosperity. but i would like to refer to the need for reform in the organization. five countries on the basis of their victories 70 over years ago cannot claim to have a right to hold the world to ransom forever. they cannot take the moral high ground, preaching democracy and regime change in the countries of the world when they deny democracy in this organization. 43. i had suggested that the veto should not be by just one permanent member but by at least two powers backed by three non-permanent members of the security council. the general assembly should then back the decision with a simple majority. i will not say more. 8 44. i must admit that the world without the un would be disastrous. we need the un, we need to sustain it with sufficient funds. no one should threaten it with financial deprivation. madam president 45. after 15 years and at 93, i return to this podium with the heavy task of bringing the voice and hope of the new malaysia to the world stage. the people of malaysia, proud of their recent democratic achievement, have high hopes that around the world – we will see peace, progress and prosperity. in this we look toward the un to hear our pleas. i thank you, madam president. 9","mahathir mohamad, prime minister of malaysia, said a new malaysia emerged in may when its citizens voted to change their government, which had been in power since independence. that new malaysia will firmly espouse the principles underpinning the united nations, he said, adding that it is in that context that it will ratify all remaining united nations human rights instruments. doing so will not be easy, given the country’s ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic diversity, but time and space will be given to all to deliberate and decide freely. he said the world is in a worse state economically, socially and politically since he last spoke before the assembly in 2003, with the international community feeling the pain of a trade war between its two most powerful economies and terrorist activity everywhere. pointing to the situation in the middle east, he said the only way to fight terrorism is to remove its root causes. “let the palestinians return to reclaim their land. let there be a state of palestine,” he said. fear of nuclear war has maintained peace in europe and north america for more than 70 years, but conflict elsewhere has paid handsome dividends to arms traders and manufacturers, he continued. “the arms business is now the biggest business in the world,” profiting shamelessly from death and destruction. turning to the situation in rakhine state in myanmar, he said he believed in the non‑interference in the internal affairs of nations, but questioned if independence gave a country the right to massacre its own people. he went on to say that free trade means no protection for small countries and their infant industries, with the simple products of the poor subjected to clever barriers that prevent their sale to rich markets. the boycott of malaysian palm oil is depriving hundreds of thousands of people from jobs and a decent life, he pointed out, emphasizing that 48 per cent of malaysia remains virgin jungle and that from 2020 every drop of malaysian palm oil will be certified sustainable under a new national sustainable palm oil standard. turning to the security council, he underlined that “five countries on the basis of their victories over 70 years ago cannot claim to have a right to hold the world to ransom forever.” nor can they preach democracy and regime change when they deny democracy in the united nations. he renewed his suggestion that a council veto require a minimum of two dissenting votes from permanent members and three from three non‑permanent members. the assembly would then uphold the veto with a simple majority. asserting that a world without the united nations would be a disaster, he said the organization must get sufficient funding. “no one should threaten it with financial deprivation,” he stated."
Maldives,,"ali naseer mohamed (maldives) said the united nations must play a greater leadership role in collective efforts to build resilient communities. building resilience is the cornerstone of his country’s development strategy, he said, drawing attention to its recent peaceful elections — “a moment that made every maldivian proud” — and the ongoing transfer of power. the accelerated pace of democratization in the maldives is proceeding in tandem with social and economic growth, resulting in one of its region’s highest human development indicators. from one of the world’s poorest countries at independence in 1965 to an upper‑middle‑income country today, the maldives is a success story by any measure. emphasizing the importance of partnerships, he said national development efforts by small island developing states such as the maldives require capacity‑building, technology transfer and access to finance. the united nations can do more to foster such support, he said, calling on the general assembly to provide the secretariat with a more balanced allocation of resources to help countries in special situations. he described the united nations as “the engine room of multilateralism”, with small nations, especially small island developing states, depending on multilateral norms for their existence. countries big and small must return to the right side of international law. he called for an end to the unlawful occupation of palestinian lands, a peaceful end to the war in syria, and for the recommendations of the united nations independent international fact‑finding mission on myanmar to be implemented without delay. he also underscored the need for broader systemic reform in the organization, including to the security council, stating: “the united nations needs to be an institution where every member state should feel welcomed.”"
Mali,,"ibrahim boubacar keita, president of mali, paid tribute to the men and women of the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali (minusma) for the commitment and sacrifice in a security context which is complex and difficult. underlining the collective responsibility to do more and to do better in order to render the organization more relevant and efficient for all, he welcomed the reforms undertaken by the secretary‑general in the sphere of development, peace and security. in addition to these initiatives, the composition and working methods of key bodies of the united nations, notably the security council and the general assembly, also need to be reformed to better protect future generations from the scourge of war. he recalled that, in spite of all the challenges it faces, mali recently held elections within constitutional timelines. this inclusive process enabled citizens to express freely their choices and proved the political, democratic and republican maturity of the malian people. he said he was going to work relentlessly to implement the agreement on peace and reconciliation in mali emanating from the algiers process. he also reiterated his steadfast commitment to dialog and concertation in the management of public affairs and underscored the lack of confrontation and clashes between the malian army and the armed groups since the signing of the accord in may and june 2015. the malian administration has returned to kidal and other regions of the country, he noted, adding that this allowed for the opening of classrooms and the provision of basic social services in regions affected by the conflict. however, political will alone is not sufficient to achieve all the commitments set out in the agreement. stressing the need for technical and financial support, he appealed for the resources pledged by mali’s partners to be mobilized in order to uphold the commitments set forth in the roadmap. “the malian people very much appreciate the solidarity provided by the international community through the presence and support of minusma, the barkhane french forces, g‑5 sahel [group of five for the sahel], african union, ecowas and neighboring countries,” he said. the sahel still faces terrorism, transnational crimes and various forms of trafficking, and the g‑5 sahel was set up in 2014 in nouakchott to combat these threats, he recalled. yet, he continued, “the joint g‑5 sahel force is struggling to be operational because it lacks an appropriate mandate and, above all, appropriate funding”. expressing the view that combating terrorism in sahel is a significant contribution to international security, he reiterated his call for the security council to authorize the deployment of this force under chapter 7. he further called on multilateral partners to honor their commitment to the g‑5 sahel force. turning to other regional issues, he welcomed the normalization of diplomatic relations between ethiopia and eritrea and the conclusion of a peace agreement in south sudan and expressed his appreciation for the recent legislative elections in mauritania. he expressed concern about the situation in libya that negatively impacts the security and stability of the sahel region. in light of this situation, he called on the international community to bring the libyan parties to foster dialog and seek sustainable solutions to the crisis. he also reaffirmed his country’s support for the palestinian people in “its legitimate struggle to achieve self-determination”, and called on israelis and palestinians to resume negotiation with a view to setting up a two‑state solution in peace and within internationally recognized safe borders."
Malta,"republic of malta permanent mission of the republic of malta statement by to the united nations the honorable dr. joseph muscat prime minister of the republic of malta 73'""^ session of the united nations general assembly united nations new york 27^'^ september 2018 249 east 35th street new york, n.v. 10016 phone: (212) 725-2345 fax: (212) 779-7097 email: malta-un.newyork@gov.mt () mr president, secretary-general, excellencies, this summer we lost a great man: kofi annan. he stood for how we cannot achieve the united nations' goals without being united in our approach. which is why i am here addressing you today: because i believe that global problems require global solutions. advocating a global approach does not mean loving your country less than others. it means that working together makes it less likely that a 'might is right' doctrine will prevail. and better solutions can be found together, rather than alone. to find solutions we must remain committed to communicate and understand one another. because, whatever challenges we need to address, and however different each nation's views and perspectives are, we have a better chance at solving them as a united force, rather than divided, or on our own. malta being a member of both the european union and the commonwealth knows only too well how no single nation, however big or small, cannot tackle global phenomena alone. the trend of nations drifting towards reactions confined to their own borders is of concern. some are worryingly looking at solving global issues with local solutions which, as many of you recognize, can at best give the illusion of working for a limited period of time, and at worst lead to almost immediate implosion. of course, we must respect the sovereignty of all nations, and we have no right to stand before you to judge. but those who are closing themselves off to debate are falsely believing they will escape certain issues. we are seeing divisions not just amongst global leaders and nations, but within our own societies, neighborhoods, and even families. local solutions breed global problems which can manifest themselves with devastating results. from the use of plastic products which are polluting our seas to the point they are killing our sea life. to mass migration and the effect of displacement on both migrants and host societies, where there are vulnerable people on both sides. i mention these examples because both hit us particularly hard in malta and in the mediterranean. the latter is visible to all. we are in the center of the mediterranean, in the middle of the route between north africa, libya and mainland europe. the center of a journey, thousands of persons have undertaken over past years. we have been grappling with all the complexities that this poses for years - much longer than it has been recognized as a priority by the international community, and dominating media headlines in europe and beyond. although crossings through the central mediterranean have decreased in the past year, the concerns of our populations have risen. and many feel the international community has failed in providing solutions to these concerns. this has given rise to movements that preach a single, simplistic solution to a complex phenomenon. what can surely be stopped if we have a unified approach, are the criminal gangs profiting from smuggling human beings. with a global strategy to deliver incisive blows to migrant smugglers, we can disrupt their online recruitment efforts, their payment methods, as well as their continued supply of sea vessels: most importantly, we can, together, stop these people profiting from a practice that often results in the death of innocent people. malta is a small state which registers one of the highest economic growth in europe and in the world, but also ranks among the highest worldwide in terms of the number of asylum applications per capita. despite this, malta's humanitarian response continues to fully adhere to its international commitments. this is also true for malta's policy, which has been consistent and clear. and we expect others, not only states but also non-state actors involved, to also abide by international rules. in recent weeks - because of the actions of a few who did not abide by the relevant conventions - malta had to bring together like-minded nations with humanitarian consciences to offer a place of safety to stranded migrants. malta had no legal obligation to do so, but in the spirit of unified solutions it did. and it proved that when solidarityworks, complex issues can often have simple solutions. although i am under no illusion and know this was just a temporary respite to a much bigger problem, actions like these can provide the foundations for a longer-term solution if all european union member states come together. a solution that could look like a bretton woods-styled institutional arrangement to address and manage migration, with international support. the global compact on migration, which aims to establish a new global migration governance architecture on the principle of shared international responsibilities and solidarity, is a welcome move in the right direction. but it is a milestone, not the end of the road. we must now walk the talk by engaging in operational action. mr president, narratives that use inflated or false facts, and thrive on the fear of a nation being open have led to painful outcomes in history. not just the obvious, but also international relationship dynamics, which overflows into other issues with devastating results. the current increase in nationalism and tighter borders threatens to do just that, with democratic decisions potentially being hampered, feeding extremism of all kinds. but let us take faith in knowing that in the 73 years of the un's existence, the going has always been tough. in fact, those who stood and spoke where i am today have faced much worse crises from wars, famines, injustice and killer diseases. but through unified approaches solutions were sought and nations survived. and each time we came together, we emerged stronger as an institution. we currently live in a world with less wars and more dialog and cooperation than ever before. but our work is not done. and it probably never will be. although less people live in extreme poverty, it has not been eradicated. we have found solutions to many lifethreatening diseases, yet cures are still needed for others. injustice remains, and climate change could be the biggest threat to life in history. as we solve one issue, another will replace it. the important thing is we continue striving and working towards the greater good. but we can only do this together. a way foha/ard that malta advocates is the harnessing of new technologies, which pose endless possibilities. we are currently in exciting technological times: with the lightening pace of current technological advance, each incredible piece of new innovation could hold a new solution to a problem we may have been persisting with for decades, from advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, to 3d printing and the internet of things. yes, there are challenges in this fast and obvious transition to the digital economy. these challenges have to do with the very nature of concepts that we have believed would stay with us forever. one of them is the nature of work, how we envisage it, how we compensate it, how we maximize its efficiency and how the state creates new safety nets. it is a conversation that has just started globally, but one that will shape public debate during our lifetime. we can take the antagonistic view that technological progress is bad for us, that it will lead to new types of poverty, that it will outstrip people of their right, or even take decisions out of their hands. while this might sound appealing as a short term strategy for some politicians, and even sensible to well meaning people who are afraid progress will cost them their job, it would be as myopic as those advocating for horsecarts not to be replaced by motor vehicles. be it for immigration or technology solutions do not come from closing doors. the digital economy needs to be seen as an opportunity, without nevertheless thinking that we can best harness its opportunities without evolving the current social contracts in place. those who will be able to pair the digital economy with a new state, the digital state, will be best poised to have a futureproof society where change does not galvanize extremes, but provides for other decades of sensible, mainstream policymaking and prosperity. then there are the other big questions that the dawn of this digital age will need to see answered. can we solve stalemate diplomatic negotiations by applying algorithms that can avoid war? can we disarm terrorists using the latest technology? is it possible to know immediately which remote parts of our planet need international humanitarian assistance assistance? could we create new organs for people so no one dies on a donor list? can we live the day when humanity can be told that there is a cure to all cancers? only time will tell. but it is the accessibility to advanced technologies that will lead to solutions. hopefully for the whole world. i passionately believe technology revolutionizes and improves systems. which is why, in malta, we have launched ourselves as the blockchain island by being the first jurisdiction to regularize a new technology that previously existed in a legal vacuum. blockchain makes cryptocurrencies, the inevitable future of money, more transparent since it helps filter good business from bad business. but these distributed ledger technologies can do much more. it can provide new solutions to healthcare systems where patients have real ownership of their medical records. emissions trading systems can be taken to the next level. we can help verify that humanitarian assistance is reaching its intended destination. we can make sure that nobody is deprived of their legitimate property because of compromised data. corporations will be able to become more accountable to their shareholders. states will need to move from hoarding information on citizens to regulating an environment where citizens trust the handling of their data. these are just few ways how we can counter regressive and reactionary politics. this forum shows that we stand to gain through dialog and cooperation which will always triumph over division, cynicism, and self-absorption. because, in unity we can have hope.","joseph muscat, prime minister of malta, said that to find solutions the international community must be committed to communicating and understanding one another. the trend of nations drifting towards reactions confined to their own borders is of concern. some are looking at solving global issues with local solutions, which can give the illusion of working for a limited time or can lead to almost immediate implosion. while the sovereignty of all nations must be respected, those who are closing themselves off to debate falsely believe they will escape certain issues, he cautioned. there are divisions not just among global leaders and nations, but within countries’ own societies, neighborhoods and even families, he said. local solutions breed global problems that can manifest themselves with devastating results, from the use of plastic products that are polluting the seas to mass migration and the effect of displacement on both migrants and host nations. malta has been hit particularly hard by those issues and has been grappling for years with all the complexities that such challenges pose. however, with a unified approach, criminal gangs profiting from smuggling human beings can be stopped, he emphasized. a global strategy can deliver incisive blows to migrant smugglers; their online recruitment efforts and their payment methods can be disrupted. most importantly, they can be stopped from profiting from a practice that often results in the death of innocent people. malta’s humanitarian response continues to fully adhere to its international commitments. he went on to say that, in recent weeks, because of the actions of a few who did not abide by the relevant conventions, malta had to bring together like‑minded nations with humanitarian consciences to offer a place of safety to stranded migrants. although this was just a temporary respite from a much bigger problem, actions like these can provide the foundations for a longer‑term solution if all european union member states come together. the global compact on safe, regular and orderly migration is a welcome move in the right direction, but it is a milestone, not the end of the road. although fewer people live in extreme poverty, it has not been eradicated, he noted. solutions have been found for many life‑threatening diseases, yet cures are still needed for others. injustice remains, and climate change could be the biggest threat to life in history. by harnessing new technologies, which pose endless possibilities, the world can move forward. however, while these are exciting technological times, there are also challenges in this fast transition to the digital economy. such challenges have to do with the nature of concepts that were previously thought to be unchanging, such as the nature of work. whether for technology or immigration, solutions do not come through closed doors. the digital economy needs to be seen as an opportunity, he said."

but especially for the mostvulnerable. at present —nations are pullmg in new directions, stretching the threads which hold us all together, and pushing the world to the edge. it is imperative that the member states of the united nations continue to unite behind an ibteiamteksaal snules^based oxder \\diich does not ovedook die voices die most vuhierable peoples. as a former umted nations stral^c trusteeship, the marshall islaxkls can speakwith aaithoiity fiom our own histoay -

which all must aspire to - and i^hold. the un human rights gouncil has tremendous potential to lend transparency, dialogic and progress. while we must take more time to carefully connect giob^ norms and national implementation —because one size never fits all - the united nations must never hesitate to stand to actors who would seek to evade everyone else mi^t see as common decency. and this is not an abstract statement - ffom our own histoiy, and our contemporary challeitges, 4he maismuaslaads imows^the rhie co^equences wmoh anse when abe antemadona^ comaninhy might look the other way because of poiitical eiqjediency. far more polmcal will is needed to ensure no one as tiuiy left hdnnd. wh^verftie shoztconrings ofthe un human ri^ts councii, it is on the shoulders of member states to address -

but an economic reality, as energy markets ahready p)int the way towards better choices. but i am not asking of others what we will not do at home, and this week i have announced the marshall islands is tmnsitiomng to a net zero emissions target by 2050. we are already taking action to not only meet this goal, but also in increase our near-term ambition, as well as to accelerate adaptation efforts. in imsiii^our anfetfion, i know we wiii not be sdone. t^e pacificislandforumleaders in last month's boe declaration -havedeclared clima'te change as viie -gneartest seomity feroat to our region. this political mus^ ext^iui to mgemand pnoridzed ^^stance to atollnations ibte fee marshall ishmds — vfeose very survival is at risk -

we are joined not only by other small island developing states, but many other countries who face serious challenges posed by climate impacts. as president of the climate vulnerable forum, i call on every leader in the world to join me this november 22°^ in an online viirtual summit to ensuare that no one - and no country - is left bemsid. for the marshall isl^jds, we emerged from the colonial period. world war two and the unpagts of nuclear testing conducted more than 6 decades ago. during the adoption of our c^mstitution m 1979 and becoming a un member state in 1991, we ware focused entirely on building a nation to leave behind for our children. only 27 years later, now facing the consequences of climate change - we are nowasking ourselves - what legacy will we leave as a nation forour grandchildren to inherit? madame presidmt, hie un oceans summit last year has set the sla^e to ensuxe tsaat oceans - tww) tiurds of the world's surface - must no longerbe an isolated silo, but will be an integral part of sustainable development and global commitment themarshall islands is more than 99 percent ocean. it is our culture, our primary economic pathw^, and our identity. the world must move far beyond words, and into actions, because we all' must be gravely alarmed at what has too offen become a downward spiral. earlier this year, the eight pacific leaders of the parties to the nauaru agreement met in the marshall islands, the first such leaders meeting since 2010. in the intervening years, we have rewrote the playbook ofglobal tuna markets - working to ensure this will not only be an economic lifeline for our ifotore gen^ions, but remain a vduable source of global food security and the worid's largest sustainablepurse seine.tunafi^eiy mitms iregard, i welcome the outreach and engagement ofg7 leaders to focus onoceans and fisheries, under foe leadersmp of canada. intematioiral developiment imnoe souroes need toimprove delivery of taigeted direct support. marine plastic pollution is crippling glomi waters, and illegal fishing in the pacific is more than a violation of law and treaty -

and especi?glyour youngest generations— must see that they have a rightful role at all levels ofdecision-making, includmg the highest levels ofpofiiical leadership and economic develoiwnent. as women - we are, afler all - half of the world's population. and we are not yet fully reflected in the ranks of global leaders. madiame president, for too many years, multilateral discussions to end nuclear weapons have gone in ckeles. i strongly welcome progress whenever it is ifeun^l - and i remain cautiously optimistic of efforts towar^fe a safe and secure korean peninsula - with complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. but until that is achieved, the marshall islands strongly affirms its conunitment to the full implementation of the un securi^ €otmcil%-semcti©bs, iikjlitai^^ m the aiaaddme sector. threats ofatnu^pheric testing in die pacific ocean are of obvious concern to me and my fellow pacific islaiid leaders - and for every marshahese ciitazen, ifehe impacts naadear testing are not just amstorical legacy, but a contemporary reality. these were the only instances where the un ever explicitly authorized the testing of nuclear weapons, and the consequences are horrific. the 67 nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1946 and 1958,haveproduced impacts through generations. these took place during our status as a unhed natkms strategic trust tenitory, mcluding testii^ authorized by un trusteeship resolutums 1082 and 1493. tms is a burden wmeb no other nation cot people ^ould ever bear. this is not only a lesson whichthe worldmust learn, but a situation where the united nations has already offered its assistance. my government has recently established the national nuclear commission to work carefully with affected local commiiinifies, and also re^caial and istesmafionsfl agencies, ^to better elaborate our complex issues, and to develop a strategy for nuclear justice. it is vital that all possible efforts are accdctatcd to mj) us address4!he human and the envnomnentofom: affected|>eof^e. madame president, the security council - and the united nations as a whole - must adapt and change - we are no longer the world of seven decades ago. it is important to realize un security councir reform, and to launch text-based negotiatkhis towards security council reform duringthis sessionof the general assembly. madame president, decolonization and human rights are both important issues in the pacific islands region. i strongly affirm the posidcm of the pacific island vamm leadea*s in recagniang to construdive engagement by forum countries with ludonesia with respect to -eleciioias and human rights in west papua, and the commitmebil to continue dmogue in an open and constnictive manner. madame president, the republic of the marshall islands supports the recognition of taiwan's meaningful participation within the un system, includingpfogi?ams and agencies, such asicacx the who and unfccc. the people of taiwan deserve eqpaltreaterent, and the un shouldlesofvethe seriousissue oftaiwan*s 23 million people being excludted from the un' system -

Mauritania,,"ismael ould cheikh ahmed, minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation of mauritania, noted a range of challenges including hunger, disease, wars and natural disasters. as host of the thirty-first african union summit to overcome corruption in africa, he said mauritania has adopted procedures to fight that challenge, establishing oversight agencies, implementing transparency, updating tax collection and enacting fiscal reforms. the country has also built roads, airports and seaports and made drinking water and electrical power more widely available. aiming to accelerate economic growth, he said it should exceed 4 per cent this year. to mitigate the effects of climate change, mauritania has adopted a national policy to use renewable energy and combat sand invasion, and it has ratified all international agreements on the issue, he said, noting that mauritania is involved in the great green wall for the sahara and sahel initiative. citing the importance of justice and the equitable distribution of wealth, the country has enacted measures to uphold the judiciary and protect freedom of the press, “the best avenue to enhance the practice of democracy”, he said. mauritania has abolished prison sentences for press cases and made public media outlets available to all political actors, allowing the country to maintain its ranking as number one among all arab countries for press freedom, according to reporters without borders. open dialog has been fostered between parties of the majority and opposition, leading to constitutional amendments enhancing democracy and the allocation of public funds. for the first time in history, mauritania held elections to create councils for local governance, held under an independent election commission, he said. women occupied important positions both in voting and seats won, with a quota allocated to women in all political positions, a sign of significant progress. the country has also set up vocational training for youth. addressing human rights, he said mauritania is working to improve prisons and protect prisoners from torture, and to finally eliminate any remnants of slavery, establishing ad hoc courts to combat that scourge — a move praised by a united nations special rapporteur. mauritania has long supported the south african people and honored the late nelson mandela with a main thoroughfare in the capital of nouakchott named after him. given its special geographical position in the arab and african spheres, he said mauritania plays a pivotal role in the group of five for the sahel and fighting terrorism. the country is closely following the issue of western sahara and hoping for a solution that benefits all parties. turning to the question of palestine, mauritania calls for a viable solution leading to a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital. he supported the high level african union committee on libya and confirmed the need for a political solution to the crisis in syria. calling for an end to division in yemen and supporting united nations efforts to solve that crisis, he also condemned terrorism in somalia and highlighted the need for peace in its territories. strongly condemning the killing of rohingya muslims in myanmar, he said the international community must come to their aid, and reaffirmed mauritania’s implementation of all its international commitments."
Mauritius,"73rd session of the united nations general assembly new york ******************** intervention by hon pravind kumar jugnauth prime minister of the republic of mauritius **************** friday 28 september 2018 madam president, distinguished delegates, let me join other leaders to pay a special tribute to late kofi annan, former secretarygeneral of the united nations. the legacy left by this great son of africa will remain forever carved in the history of the united nations. madam president, i warmly congratulate you on your election as the president of the 73rd session of the general assembly and wish to reassure you of our full support in your work. i also thank mr miroslav lajcak for his dedicated and able leadership; relentless commitment to multilateralism and continued engagement with member states during his presidency. madam president, 2018 is a special year for mauritius. it marks the fiftieth anniversary of our independence. we also celebrate, with immense pride and honor, fifty years of membership to this august body. the theme for this session, making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies , is both apt and timely. madam president, we are living in troubled times, marked by uncertainties and complex threats to peace, stability and sustainability of our planet. increased international tensions, intractable conflicts, expanding pockets of poverty throughout the world, growing inequalities, the deterioration of the oceans, climate change, violent extremism and terrorism, nationalism, cyber threats, escalading militarization, and forced migration are only some of the perils that endanger global peace and security. these challenges cannot be overcome without greater cooperation, global leadership and shared responsibilities. we wholeheartedly welcome the reform process to make the united nations fit for purpose, closer and in synchronization with the people that it serves and better page 2 of 8 equipped to service the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development so that no one, irrespective of race and gender, is left behind. madam president, my government remains fully committed to the 2030 agenda. in this regard, mauritius will present its voluntary national review at the 2019 high level political forum next july. madam president, the samoa pathway remains a valid roadmap for us to measure how much progress has been achieved in addressing the challenges and difficulties faced by sids, including climate change. we welcome the holding of the mid-term review of the samoa pathway next september and call on all stakeholders to participate at the highest level in order to accompany sids in strengthening their resilience. the stark effects of climate change are being felt all around the world. as we have seen in california, the carolinas, the philippines, china, europe and elsewhere, the frequency of extreme weather events demonstrates that the impacts of climate change can affect every country on every continent. hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires are becoming deadlier, and weather patterns more severe. these disasters are sounding the alarm. without a renewed global commitment to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects we will fail to meet the targets of the paris agreement, and endanger our planet as well as our own survival. madam president, we cannot dissociate climate from our oceans. our planet s future also depends on our ability to further protect the ocean and increase its ability to act as a buffer against climate change. we need global leadership and enhanced multilateral cooperation to safeguard the ocean and its role as the natural weather regulator of our planet. madam president, as a large ocean state, respectful of the rule of law and international law, mauritius has taken the lead in the western indian ocean region to combat piracy and other transnational organized crimes, and keep its territory and surrounding areas safe. page 3 of 8 as chair of the indian ocean commission, mauritius co-hosted with the indian ocean commission a ministerial conference on maritime security in april 2018, to coordinate actions to fight transnational organized crimes, such as drug trafficking, piracy and human trafficking. in doing so, we have consolidated our engagement with the un system, in particular, the united nations office on drugs and crime (unodc) and the united nations department of political affairs (undpa) with which we have recently signed an mou to assist the indian ocean region to fight these security threats and challenges. madam president, we are equally concerned with the situation in the middle east where the scourge of violence and war continues to claim innocent lives. peace in that region would remain elusive as long as the international community does not live up to its legal and moral responsibilities to uphold international law. mauritius therefore reiterates its call for renewed and genuine international efforts for negotiations towards an early realization of the two-state solution, with an independent and viable palestine, existing side by side and at peace with the state of israel. while we wait for this to happen, it is extremely important that the sufferings of the people, especially women and children, are alleviated through renewed and increased international support. madam president, despite all current efforts, terrorism still remains a painful reality claiming numerous lives daily and threatening world peace and development. it is urgent to build consensus on global counter terrorism efforts and reinforce multilateral cooperation in fighting this scourge. indeed, we need to pay attention to why individuals are attracted to violent extremist groups. we are convinced that the creation of open, equitable, inclusive and pluralist societies, based on the full respect of human rights and with education and economic opportunities for all, represents the most effective way to end violent extremism. madam president, in the same vein, we need to reinforce global non-proliferation regimes. the continued existence of nuclear arsenals and the threat of a nuclear disaster represents a major impediment to the maintenance of peace and security. page 4 of 8 we need to also remain vigilant to the cyberthreats which endanger our national security. as highlighted in the new disarmament agenda by the un secretary-general in may 2018, we need to create secure space, land, sea, spatial, and cyber zones alike. we need to do whatever is necessary to make our planet a safe place for all. madam president, unregulated drug consumption and trafficking if unchecked has the potential of destroying the future of our youth. we are but too well aware how drugs undermine sustainable human development and the stability of countries and whole regions. my government remains determined to fight drug trafficking. in that regard, the commission of inquiry on drugs set up to enquire on all aspects of drug trafficking in mauritius has recently submitted its findings. i have set up a ministerial committee to look into the recommendations of the commission which includes, inter alia, the strengthening of existing institutional framework as well the review of relevant legislations. to address the evolving challenges of drugs, my country committed itself to the global call to action on the world drug problem. more than ever we need closer cooperation to address this scourge. madam president, we must be cautious not to undermine the multilateral system as this has served the comity of nations well. the united nations was created to bring states together. it also established conditions under which justice and respect for law can be maintained and strengthened. madam president, conscious of the responsibility of belonging to this assembly, my country, at its admission, made a pledge in 1968 to uphold the great ideals which are enshrined in the charter of the united nations. we gave the assurance to bring our contribution, however modest it may be, to the shaping of the destiny of a better world. as a responsible member of this comity of nations, mauritius has remained true to this pledge. page 5 of 8 today i reaffirm my country s continued commitment to the ideals and values of this institution, the respect for international law and faith in international partnership to build a safer and more prosperous world. it is with this commitment that mauritius subscribes to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and we look forward to its endorsement in marrakech in december. madam president, in the same spirit of upholding the charter of the united nations and their commitment to the international rule of law, in june 2017 member states of the group of african states tabled a resolution to seek an advisory opinion of the international court of justice on the legal consequences of the separation of the chagos archipelago from mauritius in 1965. at the heart of this request for an advisory opinion is the issue of decolonization, a matter of international public order under the charter, a central element of the work of the united nations and general assembly. the decolonization of mauritius remains to date incomplete in view of the unlawful excision of the chagos archipelago from mauritius prior to its accession to independence. madam president, the hearings at the court have been completed, and the judges will now deliberate on a matter that has raised important issues on decolonization and human rights, particularly the right to self-determination of the people of mauritius and the plight suffered by mauritians of chagossian origin who were forcibly removed from the chagos archipelago. the advisory opinion will also further clarify and strengthen the rule of law at the international level, at a time when such strengthening is greatly needed. i take this opportunity to express my government’s appreciation to all the member states and the african union which have actively participated in the written and oral proceedings of the international court of justice relating to this matter. madam president, the united nations is and will always be at the center of all action for sustainable development, peace and security. while we applaud the secretary-general-led three¬ page 6 of 8 pronged reform of the united nations, considerable resources will be required to match this ambition. we appeal to all stake holders to generously support this reform by providing adequate resources on a predictable basis. we also appeal for a special consideration of africa s needs and priorities in the restructuring of the peace and security architecture. madam president, we commend the efforts of the secretary general to enhance the framework of cooperation between the united nations and the african union- so vital for sustained peace and development in the continent. africa s growth is showing promising signs of rebounding. already several countries are undergoing positive transitions. elections in africa during the last several years demonstrate that african countries have strengthened their democracies while ensuring a peaceful transition of power. we welcome the signature of a historical peace agreement between ethiopia and eritrea ending two decades of tension which followed years of open conflict causing the loss of thousands of lives. this improved political climate, reconciliation efforts, and inclusive participation rights herald a new age of governance that deser es to be supported by the international community. madam president, one aspect of the united nation’s reform where we find progress wanting is the collective aspiration for a strengthened and more legitimate security council reflecting today’s reality. we call, once again, for the reform of the unsc and repeat our plea for the start of a text-based negotiation. we all agree that an equitable representation of africa in the security council will not only redress a gross historical injustice but render the council more democratic and representational. we also support india’s legitimate aspiration for a permanent seat in an enlarged security council and a non-permanent seat for sids. page 7 of 8 madam president, three days ago, we celebrated the memory and legacy of one of africa s most illustrious leaders, nelson mandela. we, as world leaders, would benefit from being inspired by the words and actions of mandela, especially when he says and i quote what counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. it is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead unquote. together we can make that difference. thank you. page 8 of 8","pravind kumar jugnauth, prime minister of mauritius, declared: “we are living in troubled times, marked by uncertainties and complex threats to peace, stability and sustainability of our planet.” citing increased tensions, intractable conflicts, expanding pockets of poverty, growing inequalities, the deterioration of the ocean, climate change, violent extremism and terrorism, cyberthreats, escalating militarization and forced migration, he welcomed efforts to reform the united nations and make it fit for purpose to meet those challenges on behalf of the people it serves. noting that mauritius will present its voluntary national review on the implementation of the 2030 agenda targets during the 2019 high‑level political forum held under the auspices of the economic and social council, he hailed the small island developing states accelerated modalities of action — known as the samoa pathway — as a valid road map to measure how much progress has been made in addressing the special challenges facing those nations. “the stark effects of climate change are being felt all over the world” from the united states’ states of california and the carolinas to the philippines, europe, china and elsewhere. the frequency of extreme weather events demonstrates that the impacts of climate change can affect every country on every continent, he stressed. warning that renewed commitments towards ambitious action are needed to meet the targets of the paris agreement, he said the planet’s future also depends on the ability to further protect the ocean and increase its ability to act as a buffer against climate change. outlining mauritius’ efforts to combat piracy and transnational organized crime in the indian ocean and surrounding areas, he spotlighted his government’s chairmanship of the indian ocean commission and its close engagement with the united nations office on drugs and crime (unodc) in those efforts. he went on to spotlight other critical global issues, including war and conflict in the middle east, the threat posed by terrorism and the need to reinforce global non‑proliferation regimes. “the continued existence of nuclear arsenals and the threat of a nuclear disaster represent a major impediment to the maintenance of peace and security,” he said, adding: “we must be cautious not to undermine the multilateral system, as this has served the community of nations well.” the united nations was created to bring states together and it established conditions under which justice and respect for law can be maintained and strengthened. reaffirming his commitment to those ideas and values, he expressed mauritius’ support for the global compact on migration to be endorsed in december as well as the united nations continued decolonization efforts. in that vein, he said the decolonization of mauritius remains to date incomplete in view of the unlawful exclusion of the chagos archipelago from the country prior to its accession to independence. welcoming diplomatic developments in the horn of africa as well as signs that the continent’s overall growth is rebounding, he also reiterated calls to begin a text‑based negotiation to reform the security council including a permanent seat for india’s and africa’s equitable representation."
Mexico,,"enrique peña nieto, president of mexico, said his country, through an institutional architecture created to move forward on the 2030 agenda, is promoting a form of sustainable development that benefits all. the implementation of the paris agreement on climate change is a priority, he stated, and the international community has a moral obligation to not only implement it, but also comply with even more ambitious goals. mexico has also taken action towards solutions to the challenges of migration, he said, welcoming the progress made on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. based on a new paradigm, mexico has worked in the past two years to establish the compact’s guiding principles: the respect of human rights of all migrants, shared responsibility and the full respect of the sovereignty of states. the adoption of this instrument in marrakesh will provide member states with a fundamental document for international management of migration. mexico has also renewed its contribution to peacekeeping operations in africa, the middle east and latin america and the caribbean, he said. as well, it distinguished itself by working towards the full elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. he called on all member states to sign and ratify the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons without delay. in addition, “the trafficking of illicit weapons, due to its gravity, is a scourge with which we must deal immediately”, he stressed. the outcome of the 2016 special session of the general assembly on the world drug problem will also be a watershed for the international drug control regime. in that regard, there was a need to move from prohibition to effective regulation. acknowledging that mexico still faces major human rights‑related problems, he noted that his country implemented specific policies and accepted international scrutiny in that regard. the international community must continue to promote the respect of democratic principles as part of its work on human rights. the breakage of democratic order in some parts of the americas is a grave concern, and mexico will work to ensure that peace, democracy and the respect of human rights are re-established in every corner of the continent, while fully respecting the principle of non‑intervention. he also reiterated the call to put an end to the trade and financial embargo on cuba, stressing that solutions to problems are found in dialog and negotiation. the lifting of this embargo will be positive for the entire region, he added. exclusionary nationalisms, protectionist practices, and the erosion of multilateralism promote various forms of exclusion, he noted. faced with these concerning trends, he reaffirmed the importance of cooperation, adding that “multilateralism is the best way to defend the sovereignty of states while contributing to the well‑being of the community of nations”. towards that end, dialog, cooperation and an international rules‑based system are the best options to find fair, shared and lasting solutions to global problems. chiding those who choose exclusion and discord, he emphasized that the challenges facing the international community force member states to remain faithful to the principles established in the united nations charter."

(212)697-8295 e-mail: fsmun@fsmgov.org http://www.fsmgov.org/ address by president peter christian before the united nations general assembly at its 73ld session new york, 27 september 2018 president of the general assembly, secretary-general, your majesties, heads of states and governments, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. it is a pleasure to address this general assembly under the able leadership of president maria fernanda espinosa garces. madame president, this organization needs good leadership and i am sure that you will ably take us in the right direction. i offer my congratulations to you and your government for your election. madame president, when the armed conflicts that dominated the world in the first four decades of the last century ended, the world slipped into another war; the cold war. a period of suspicion and deceit; an era deeply rooted in clandestine engagement, reminding us of a great englishman s word that the truth is so precious that it must be protected by lies. the fight continues today, waged between the bigger and the richer with the might of wealth with the smaller economies aligned and marginalized, becoming again the spoils of now an economic war. now fostering new econo ic colonies. as in all wars many people become innocent victims, and are often filed away simply as collateral damage, as spoils of war, becoming possessions of victors and allies. madame president, we open another general assembly with our world facing record and serious challenges. and yet, we ask ourselves this question: is pluto a planet or not? is that a relevant question to our current earth conditions? our aim today must be to improve on the united nation as forum on which we work to prevent this from continuing, to seek curative measures, to slow and to stop this economic war, and as an end, hopefully to accelerate the effort to close the gap of economic imbalance. we also must avoid deliberate procrastination motivated by geopolitical greed for dominance and economic 1 imperialism. s ch a state only brings pain and misery to those whose only guilt is being in the path. we must recommend what the future should hold for us. we of the great ocean about whom someone had dubbed the decade of the pacific, must adopt a more progressive attitude toward taking charge of our affairs and make ourselves directly relevant to matters that touch and stain our lives. madame president, the existential threat of climate change is becoming more real with every hurricane, wildfire, heat wave, and centimeter of sea-level rise. these are the realities that many of us are seeing and experiencing. islands within the federated states of micronesia (fsm) and our neighbors, kiribati, the marshall islands and tuvalu in the pacific will be among the first to, literally, disappear. in 2009 micronesia proposed a fast action strategy using the montreal protocol to explicitly cut climate emissions to avoid warming of 0.5 degrees celsius by the end of the century. while it may sound like a small amount, it s 50% more than the warming we are experiencing today, which is already producing super storms like typhoon mangkhut in the philippines and hurricane florence in the us. in order to achieve this goal we urge all countries who have not yet done so to ratify the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol - and to accelerate the implementation of this planet-saving strategy. on our current trajectory, many more islands will be lost, many homes destroyed, many people displaced. but we can still avoid the worst climate impacts if we recognize the need for speed, and take fast action. the paris agreement may have shortcomings, but we believe it is the best platform to achieve this goal. and we believe that no matter how difficult and sensitive the issues associated with climate change, we need everyone onboard. we are disappointed that some countries are considering withdrawing from the agreement and we call on them to reconsider. madame president, micronesia is a large ocean state blessed with abundant marine resources. a key concern for micronesia, and all small island developing states, is rightly focused on a healthy, productive and resilient ocean. the resources of the ocean are the bedrock of the micronesian nations. a sizable percentage of our economy comes from our ocean based activities - whether it is fisheries, tourism, or maritime transport. micronesia is committed to the pacific islands forum leaders’ declaration to safeguard the oce n and its resources. in this, i join my fellow pacific leaders as we commit to eliminate marine litter and the urgency of implementing the pacific marine litter action plan. for micronesia, our fisheries is critical to the socio-economic well-being of our people. madame president, while we welcome the recent decision by the commission to place the topic sea-level rise in relation to international law on its long-term program of work, we strongly recommend that the subject be placed on the commission’s active program of work because of the direct implications of sea-level rise on maritime baseline and maritime boundaries. 2 madame president, on global peace, to wish for peace is global. it has no bou daries. micronesia is encouraged by the peace reached by eritrea and ethiopia, and we wish the people of those countries the very best. we also wish that other countries who are engaged in conflicts that similar resolutions be achieved. in our region of the world, we have a stake in the ongoing peace negotiations between the democratic people s republic of korea and the republic of korea. we recognize and encourage the continuing efforts to bring peace and stability to the korean peninsula. a lasting peace on the peninsula translates to a more secure and stable pacific region. elsewhere in the world, we cannot ignore the pain and suffering of so many people caught in pockets of armed conflicts. as world leaders, we have fallen short of our responsibilities. it is deeply troubling to see those who wield tremendous powers, fail to take bold and decisive actions to end these serious atrocities. and we wonder if for some unknown reason such conflicts might not be good for them politically or even economically. and we think what a shame. madame president, the united nations needs to be relevant and deal with emerging threats. we find it deeply troubling that the threat posed by climate change to our existence has not received the security council’s serious consideration. the pacific sids have made a proposal for consideration by the council. while the proposal in itself will not immediately save our islands, it is a step in the right direction. micronesia believes that a security council conceived in the 20th century needs to be more efficient, more representative, more responsive, and must show greater leadership in its response to today’s new challenges. madame president, micronesia welcomes the secretary-general’s objective of the repositioning of the united nations development system to deliver on the 2030 agenda. the united nations development system has impact and influence when it is focused. it is of utmost importance that its operational activities for development, take into account the need to build, promote, and strengthen the capacity of small island developing states. for micronesia the role of the united nations development system, in particular undp, to support and enhance the capacity of island countries to implement the 2030 agenda must not be over-looked. but this requires the scaling up of undp presence, particularly, in our north pacific where its presence can ake a real difference and a crucial factor in our development efforts. madame president, the united nations represents the best hope for humanity. and we the members must ensure that it is. i thank you, madame president. 3","peter m. christian, president of the federated states of micronesia, said that the last two speakers had said it all, especially new zealand, which spoke about the fate of pacific island countries with regards to climate change. he noted that when the cold war hit, the era was deeply rooted in clandestine engagement, reminding everyone of winston churchill’s words that “the truth is so precious that it must be protected by lies.” this resonated today, with the fight between the bigger, richer countries and the smaller, marginalized economies becoming again the spoils of a new economic war fostering new economic colonies. in all wars, innocent lives are filed away as collateral damage. he continued, saying that the meeting was opened with the world facing serious challenges, and “yet we dare to ask ourselves, is pluto a planet? how is that relevant to what we face today? perhaps pluto can wait.” he called for improving the united nations as a forum that seeks curative measures, to stop this economic war, to close the gap, and to avoid deliberate procrastination on these issues. a more progressive attitude must be adopted, he said, noting that the existential threat of climate change is more real with every hurricane, wildfire, heat wave and centimeter of sea rise. islands in the federated states of micronesia, and neighboring kiribati, marshall islands and tuvalu, will be the first to literally disappear. noting that in 2009 the federated states of micronesia proposed a fast‑action strategy using the montreal protocol to reduce climate emissions to avoid a 0.5°c temperature rise by the end of the century, he said that amount is more than half of the present level of temperature warming that has already produced super storms like typhoon mangkhut in the philippines and hurricane florence in the united states. to achieve this goal, he urged countries that have yet to do so to ratify the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol. if the current trajectory continues, many more islands will be lost and people will be displaced, he said, but the world can avoid the climate impact with fast action. he noted the power of the paris agreement and said everyone must be on board. “i am disappointed that some countries are considering withdrawing from the agreement and i call on them to reconsider,” he said. the federated states of micronesia has abundant marine resources and among its key concerns is a healthy, productive, resilient ocean which is the bedrock of the country’s livelihood, he said, reaffirming a commitment to the pacific islands forum leaders declaration to safeguard the ocean. while welcoming the recent decision by the international law commission to place the topic “sea‑level rise in relation to international law” on its long‑term work program, he strongly recommended it be placed on its active program because of the direct implications of sea‑level rise for maritime baselines and boundaries. moving on to the issue of global peace, he said he is encouraged by the peace of eritrea and ethiopia. the pacific region has a stake in peace on the korean peninsula, which would make the region more secure and stable. the pain of all people in armed conflict cannot be ignored. “as world leaders, we have fallen short of our responsibilities,” he said. the united nations needs to be relevant, he said. “we find it deeply troubling that the threat posed by climate change to our existence has not received the security council’s serious attention,” he said, adding that pacific island states have made a proposal to the council that is a step in the right direction. the council needs to be more representative and responsive to today’s challenges. the role of the united nations development system to enhance the capacity of small island developing states must not be overlooked, he said, calling on the united nations development program (undp) to scale up its presence in the north pacific."
Monaco,,"gilles tonelli, minister for foreign affairs of monaco, recalled that nations, great and small, have committed to the economic and social advancement of all people. the united nations and its member states have consistently adapted to the new challenges spawned by international terrorism and crime. when the security council is deadlocked, civilians, particularly women and children, suffer the most. the council must not be prevented from acting in cases of mass atrocities. he welcomed the involvement of young people and women in conflict resolution. monaco is fully committed to reinforcing respect for international law and international humanitarian law, he continued. welcoming the various new initiatives launched by the secretary-general, including the united nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, he noted that monaco upholds various international treaties that promote and protect human rights. turning to migration, he said that more than 68 million people were displaced in 2017. it is unacceptable that millions lack access to clean drinking water and sanitation. the myriad crises are intertwined and related. on climate change, he said its systematic repercussions have spared no region. “if we fail to act, we will have to prepare to live on a shattered planet,” he warned. the term urgency is nearly obsolete these days. it is imperative the international community adopts rules and implements the paris accord for the sake of our and future generations. monaco aims to achieve carbon neutrality among other targets, he said, adding that such goals will only be achieved with the support of its people. there is no development without peace, he reiterated, saying that the adage has guided the work of the international community for decades. “progress has been uneven and slow,” he added. monaco has prioritized partnerships and international cooperation given the solid evidence that one alone cannot achieve sustained progress. cooperation is essential. monaco has built its relationships based on trust. given the proliferation of challenges, the international community must stand together and work in cooperation to find solutions."

united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies new york, 28 september 2018 statement by h.e. mr. khurelsukh ukhnaa, prime-minister of mongolia at the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly (new york, 28 september 2018) theme: making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies madame president of the general assembly, mr. secretary-general, honorable ladies and gentlemen, distinguished delegates, at the outset, i wish to express my heartfelt congratulations to ms. maria fernanda espinosa games for being elected as the president of the 73rd session of the general assembly. i pledge my delegation s full support and cooperation in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities. madame president, today, we are living in the flat, globalized and interrelated world. our life is digitalized to a great extent and the way of life is greatly shaped by technological progresses. in spite of this development, we are encountering a plethora of global sore points including conflicts, poverty, hunger, and inequality. hence, i am glad to represent my government at this general debate, which will deliberate issues of making the united nations more relevant to all people and making the world more peaceful, equitable and sustainable. in the past 73 years, the united nations outreached every member state through its diligent activities for peace, justice and global understanding. thus, under the sustainable development agenda, it is timely for the united nations and in line with its founding principles, to endeavor reaching everyone in the member states. mongolia appreciates leadership of the secretary-general antonio guterres reinforcing the joint efforts of member states on leaving no one behind through his reform initiatives. 1 we are supporting his reform initiatives in the peace and security architecture which is aimed at ensuring stronger prevention and mediation activities and making peacekeeping operations more cost-effective, as well as in repositioning of the un development system which aspires to reform the un into a more effective, we 11-coordinated, transparent and accountable organization. madame president, according to the stockholm international peace research institute report, the world military expenditure is estimated to have reached $1.7 trillion in 2017. this is not only an increase from the previous year, but also the highest level since the end of the cold war. the armaments race is not declining and situations in some regions are instable due to aggravating conflicts. use of technological advancements in armed conflicts is making the circumstances more dangerous than ever. mongolia has always been standing for its principled position that any conflicts should be resolved peacefully and through dialog. based on our peaceful mind stemmed from the national mentality and religious belief, we always supported peace and security initiatives raised at the united nations general assemblies and other fora and strived to be a responsible member of the organization. just to cite some of the mongolia s initiatives proving its contributions to the peace and security at global and regional echelons are the general assembly resolutions on disarmament week observed on 24-30 october every year since 1978 and declaration on the right of peoples to peace in 1984 and the declaration of its territory as nuclear weapon free in 1992, which is progressively being guaranteed. there is a mongolian saying that it’s better give a needle in time of need rather than gifting a camel when wealthy , or as it is said in english a friend in need is a friend indeed . mongolians always try to assist other nations and people when they are in need or seeking peace and stability. there was an occasion when we brought hundreds of orphans from the dprk to mongolia in the post-korean war time and raised them. during the last decades, we have been stretching our hands within our capacity to a number of countries, which faced natural disasters and terrorist acts, rendering development assistance to some regional countries, and sharing our modest experience of democratic transition. this year we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the united nations peacekeeping which has contributed immensely to the world peace and security. mongolia first joined the 2 united nations peacekeeping in 2002 with the deployment of unarmed military observers and started deploying the troops in 2006. nowadays, we are proud by our troops who are praised by the international community for their robust, calm and appropriate approach to peacekeeping. as one of the top 30 troop contributing countries, as well as one the high-rankers in terms of the deployment to per capita, mongolia envisages at increasing its participation in the un peacekeeping operations and fully supports the secretary-general s action for peacekeeping initiative. madame president, addressing security issues in northeast asia is indeed one of our foreign policy priorities as it has direct impacts on mongolia s security and development. mongolia closely follows and welcomes the recent positive developments on the korean peninsula, including the inter-korean and other bilateral summits that are giving an important impetus towards confidence-building and ensuring peace and security in the northeast asia. however, we are not merely observing the process, but are trying to make our own contributions. since 1980’s, we have been consistently pursuing the policy of launching a dialog mechanism in northeast asia. a fruit of these efforts yielded in ulaanbaatar dialog on northeast asia international conference conducted since 2014 on annual basis. the dialog is now transforming into an open and inclusive mechanism gathering both government officials and the academia from all countries in the sub-region. discussion topics cover a broad range of issues including security, energy, infrastructure, green development, opportunities of humanitarian cooperation and others. on the other hand, asia is one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world. we actively support the regional cooperation for enhancing disaster resilience, reducing disaster risk and increasing effectiveness of disaster prevention activities. within this framework, we put forward an initiative to establish the northeast asia disaster risk reduction platform in mongolia. the proposal has been discussed at the ulaanbaatar dialog on northeast asia conferences and the second asian ministeral conference on disaster risk reduction successfully organized in ulaanbaatar in last july and received a warm support from regional countries for implementation. mongolians believe that neighbors share the same disposition and interests. as mongolia is determined to develop strategic partnerships with its two big neighbors, it closely follows their initiatives at the regional level and strives to engage in every possible way. lately, we proposed initiatives on travel facilitation for travelers from countries along the 3 belt and road and the peace, prosperity, progress, promise (pppp) award for junior diplomats and scholars from the belt and road countries. madame president, there is no doubt that numerous armed conflicts, rivalries, insurgencies and terrorist attacks, that trouble us today, are caused by the clash of civilizations and religions. mongolia is one of the few nations who has had no religious and ethnic wars in its history. the great mongolian empire established 812 ago was reigned by the written law and it was a genuine home of religious freedom where christians, muslims, conficians and buddhists treated equally and lived together without any idealogicial struggles. in brief, the legacy of religous tolerance and respect in the mongolian empire, which had covered an immense territory, is very instructive for the today s world. more recently, in the 20th century, in the epoque of the cold war, we were conducting salient activities for combining voices of international buddhists for the world peace through the asian buddhists conference for peace (abcp), established in 1969 and were achieving the tangible results in the fight against the ideological divide. nowadays, we deem there is a pressing demand for effective dialog mechanisms, such as the abcp, which has consultative status at the un ecosoc. thus, we are determined to revitalize its activities at regional and international arenas. in this regard, as a regional hub connecting northeast and central asian countries, we are stating our initiative to host the conference on religious freedom in march 2019 in mongolia from this honorable podium of the united nations. we are confident that our initiative will make constructive contributions in the new developments of culture of peace, religious tolerance and religious freedom worldwide. madame president, mongolia is one of the early adopters of the national sustainable development goals (sdgs) through endorsing its sustainable development vision 2030 in february 2016. as per this vision, mongolia aspires, by 2030, to consolidate its democratic governance, preserve ecological balance, eradicate poverty in all its forms and be amongst upper middleincome countries. my government has been taking important steps to ensure coherence between the sdgs and the national development policy documents, that have been previously implemented, and translate them into short- and medium term plans and programs. 4 in order to provide financing for development, the investment program has been adopted in line with the government action plan. moreover, the sdgs indicators developed on the basis of multi-stakeholders consultations will be adopted shortly. mongolia witnessed the economic resurge with the accelerated foreign trade turnover, increased investment and budget surplus during the last two years. however, mongolian economic growth, which is highly dependent on mining and vulnerable to the commodity prices, tends to be instable and risky for ensuring the allocation of financial resources for the implementation of the sustainable development goals, particularly in years of commodity price decline. moreover, another challenge faced by my government is to ensure that every citizen is to be benefited from the economic growth. for instance, following the economic growth, unemployment decreased modestly but not poverty. thus, we are inserting measures aimed at shrinking income disparities and reducing poverty into all relevant government programs and sectoral plans, compiling a complete database of low-income households and supporting public-private partnership. in order to resolve the problems comprehensively, the national program on reducing poverty and unemployment will be launched shortly. madame president, this year we are celebrating 70th anniversary of the universal declaration on human rights (udhr), a milestone document in the history of human rights. pursuant to the ideology of the declaration, mongolia has made remarkable achievements in the field of promotion and protection of human rights. in recent years, particular importance has been attached to the issues such as enhancing gender equality, protecting rights of children, elderly and persons with disabilities, fighting against human trafficking and drug, improving freedom of speech and expression. in 2016-2018, as mongolia is serving as member of the human rights council for the first time and it has been an honor for us to contribute to the global endeavors to protect and promote human rights. everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the udhr can be fully realized. following the 2016 new york declaration on refugees and migrants, member states constructively negotiated the issue of migration for the last two years. we expect that the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration to be adopted in december in marrakesh on the historic day of the 70th anniversary of the udhr will be a valuable document for the protection of rights of all migrants. 5 in the last two decades, the world is witnessing the highest level of population displacement and this phenomenon did not bypass my country, which has a small population and is located in highlands of the northeast asia. madame president, we are experiencing a high volume of internal and external migration due to a number of reasons including unemployment and poverty. owing to a large movement of citizens from countryside to cities since 1990 s, as of 2017,45 percent of our total population lives in the capital city of ulaanbaatarwith net annual growth of 22.3 percent. it results in a more social ramification including poverty, unemployment, poor access to health care services and air pollution in the capital city compared to any other places. citizens of mongolia are highly educated and the fact that the second biggest package of the state budget in 2018 was allocated to the education sector, demonstrates the government s firm commitment to prioritize human resource development. however, school availability and quality of education do not always match up with the demographic growth, urbanization pace and modern education standards. while the pupil-classroom ratio in schools and kindergartens has decreased together with the population density in rural areas, the case is opposite in the urban centers. a memory makes anxious where at one of my public meetings held last year in ulaanbaatar, a citizen told me how his 10-year-old kid had to walk home at 9 pm through dark streets in winter time at a temperature of minus 20-25 degrees celsius after attending the third shift at his school which does not provide school bus service. the government of mongolia is planning and implementing policies and programs that aim, by 2030, to address effectively the challenges faced by the capital city, including shortage of kindergartens, about 30 schools in suburbs functioning in three shifts, overload of family hospitals, hazardous impacts of air pollution on people s health, as well as the issue of unemployed people in ulaanbaatar which accounts one third of the national unemployment rate. furthermore, about 5 percent of our total working age population is working abroad and this number tends to grow. thus, we need to take comprehensive measures to resolve the issues of their health care, social insurance, dual citizenship and improve the related legal environment. 6 madame president, in our time, climate change is another daunting challenge for humanity that goes hand in hand with peace, security and development issues. the paris agreement has been ratified by 179 countries. however, the implementation does not meet the expectation and the fulfillment of shared responsibilities by member states remains insufficient. therefore, we welcome and support the secretary- general's timely initiative to convene the climate summit in september 2019 for reviewing the paris agreement commitments. global warming and climate change impacts all nations which are felt more intensely on the economic and social development of the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states. in this regard i would like to highlight that by the initiative and leadership of mongolia, the international think tank for landlocked developing countries has been established in ulaanbaatar and fully operationalized last may. the international think tank, the first ever intergovernmental organization representing the 32 landlocked developing countries, will conduct policy research works and implement feasible projects to addess common challenges and protect interests and positions of those countries with the purpose of augmenting their benefit from international trade. i am confident that you will continue your cooperation and support to the activities of this think tank as previously. in mongolia, where extreme weather conditions prevail and economy mostly relies on mining and agriculture, the scope, frequency, and negative impact of disasters, such as earthquake, desertification, soil erosion and forestfires have increased in recent years. taking this opportunity, i wish to inform you that on the occasion of the un climate week, my delegation is launching a documentary titled blue gold . we are sharing this documentary with you not only for showing the devastating impact of the climate change in mongolia, but also alarming about similar consequences and appealing for timely safeguarding steps. in conclusion, from this honorable podium of the united nations, i would like to call on unity of the all nations under mutual trust, consciousness of our responsibilites for the sake of not only current but also future generations, as well as to strive for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. thank you for your attention. 7","khurelsukh ukhnaa, prime minister of mongolia, noted that today we are living in a flat, globalized, and interrelated world where our life is digitized, and life is greatly shaped by technological progress. despite these developments, we encounter conflicts, poverty, hunger and inequality. in that vein, mongolia supports reform initiatives in the peace architecture, aimed at ensuring stronger prevention and mediation. referring to the stockholm international peace research institute report, world military expenditure is estimated to have reached $1.7 trillion in 2017, the highest level since the cold war. the armaments race is not declining, and the use of technological advancements in armed conflicts is making the circumstances more dangerous than ever, he noted, citing mongolia’s initiatives proving its contributions to peace and security, including bringing hundreds of orphans from the democratic people’s republic of korea to mongolia after the korean war. addressing security issues in north‑east asia, he said it is a foreign policy priority as it directly impacts mongolia’s security. he welcomed the recent positive developments on the korean peninsula and said that his country has, since the 1980s, consistently pursued the policy of launching a dialog mechanism in north‑east asia. the dialog is now transforming into an open and inclusive mechanism gathering both government officials and academia from all countries in the subregion. asia is one of the most disaster‑prone regions in the world. within this framework, the country put forward an initiative to establish the northeast asia disaster risk reduction platform in mongolia. moving on to the seventieth anniversary of the universal declaration on human rights, he noted that mongolia has made remarkable achievements in the field of promotion and protection of human rights, and that his country is currently on the human rights council. he noted everyone is entitled to a social and international order in accord with the rights and freedoms set forth in the new york declaration for refugees and migrants. stressing the issue within his own country, he noted mongolia is experiencing a high volume of internal and external migration due to unemployment and poverty. this includes a large movement of citizens from the countryside to cities begun in the 1990s — and as of 2017, 45 per cent of the total population lives in the capital city of ulaanbaatar. this results in social ramifications such as poverty, unemployment, poor access to health‑care services and air pollution. he said that citizens of mongolia are highly educated, but the pupil‑classroom ratio in schools and in kindergarten has decreased together with the population density in rural areas; however, the case is opposite in the urban centers. thus, mongolia is planning and implementing policies and programs that address the challenges faced by the capital city by 2030. this includes addressing a shortage of kindergartens, as well as 30 schools in suburbs functioning in three shifts. he noted other issues such as air pollution, as well as the number of unemployed people in ulaanbaatar, which accounts for one third of the national unemployment rate. on climate change, he noted the daunting challenge for humanity that goes hand in hand with peace, security and development issues. his country welcomes and supports the secretary‑general’s timely initiative to convene a climate summit in september 2019. he stressed that climate change most impacts the least developed countries, landlocked developing nations and small island developing states. in that regard, he highlighted the initiative and leadership of mongolia, as the international think tank for landlocked developing countries has been established in ulaanbaatar and operationalized in may. the think tank represents 32 landlocked developing countries and will conduct policy research and implement projects to address common challenges. noting the issue of water that is being addressed this week, during the united nations climate week, mongolia’s delegation launched a documentary titled blue gold, which shows the devastating impact of climate change on the country."
Montenegro,"prime minister of montenegro duško marković address at the general debate of the 73rd session of the general assembly of the united nations new york, 28th september 2018 madam president, secretary-general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to address you on behalf of montenegro, one of the youngest members of the united nations, which has clearly and unequivocally confirmed commitment to joint action within the un system in the past 12 years since the renewal of its statehood. allow me, in the beginning, to congratulate mrs. maria fernanda espinoza garsez from ecuador on her election as the president of the 73rd session of the general assembly, and wish her success in carrying out this responsible duty. i also want to thank the president of the previous 72nd session of the general assembly, mr. miroslav lajčák, for his outstanding leadership and contribution to strengthening the role of the general assembly and stepping up the dialog with the member states. dear miroslav, i congratulate you on another job well done, with gratitude for the lasting friendship you cherish with montenegro. ladies and gentlemen, i welcome the choice of the topic of the general debate of the 73rd session. i firmly believe that in these challenging times concerted action and common responsibility for peaceful, just and sustainable societies are the only correct way that will lead us to the goal; that the united nations be relevant to all people on the planet. given the complex situations and challenges that the world is facing, the grave divisions on numerous grounds, the catastrophic consequences of the spread of terrorism and violent extremism, as well as climate change, there is no dilemma that only by joint action can we contribute to resolving conflicts and preventing further suffering of innocent people. historic multilateral agreements that we have agreed in the previous period show what we can do with joint action. these agreements, primarily – the 2030 development agenda, but also the climate agreement, make a vision of our common future and confirm that multilateralism is not an option, but the only effective means. for the full implementation of the adopted agreements, the reform of the un and the strengthening of the central role of the world organization in multilateralism is necessary more than ever. therefore, this 73rd session is of paramount importance for the return of confidence in the united nations i.e. that, regardless of sometimes justified criticism, they are capable of achieving the noble objectives for which they were founded. we cannot say that these lofty goals have been achieved in today's world. let's not hide this fact, let's look it in the eyes and take on our share of responsibility for today's, but also tomorrow's world. montenegro strongly supports the process of reform of the united nations. i am confident that the issue of fragmentation of the world organization can be solved with a stronger binding of all three pillars of action and greater transparency, efficiency and accountability. i believe that the implementation of the complex reform agenda and the strong leadership of secretary-general guterres will result in a more efficient organization, which will contribute to reducing the suffering throughout the world and ensuring common peace, security and prosperity. ladies and gentlemen, allow me to remind you in a nutshell of the views of montenegro on some of the key topics on the agenda and this session of the general assembly: first of all, montenegro is strongly committed to the policy and implementation of the sustainable development goals, which are complementary to the reforms that we are implementing in the process of european integration. furthermore, although it has a small share in global emission and population statistics, montenegro is committed to the implementation of the paris agreement through responsible and sustainable management of its development potentials. montenegro welcomes the initiative of the secretary-general to hold the climate change summit in 2019. in terms of finding solutions to conflicts around the world, we are aware that the international community often fails to prevent crime and suffering of a large number of people. in addition to the longstanding conflict in syria, the findings of the commission on inquiry human rights violations in myanmar additionally warns of the importance of prevention and timely addressing the causes of instability. our moral and political responsibility is to ensure the eradication of impunity for crimes committed. in this regard, the role of the security council, the international criminal court and the criminal tribunals is crucial. montenegro expresses regret over the stalemate in resolving the longstanding israeli-palestinian conflict and the lack of progress in resolving the worsening humanitarian situation in the gaza strip. on this occasion, we call on all parties to uphold the international law and refrain from unilateral actions that distort confidence and make it difficult to reach a mutually acceptable peace agreement. we strongly support the resuming of negotiations and the application of mediation in order to reach a peaceful solution. conflicts in syria, yemen, libya and other countries, as well as the longstanding palestinian-israeli conflict, require an immediate end to violence, respect for international law by all parties to the conflict, and urgent finding of peace solutions through diplomatic means. in order to eradicate terrorism and violent extremism, we must step up efforts to strengthen the implementation of the preventive pillar of the un global counter-terrorism strategy. the focus of our activities must be on the integration of vulnerable and marginalized groups, and the care for young people as the main actors of a better future. we strongly support global efforts towards disarmament and nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons. i am certain that by consistent application of the relevant treaties on nuclear disarmament and arms control, we can get to a world without nuclear weapons. therefore, we support the activities of the united states of america, the republic of korea and the democratic people's republic of korea intended to ensure the denuclearization of the korean peninsula. madam president, i will touch upon two very important aspects of today's world, which are intertwined: human rights and humanitarian challenges. any violation of human rights poses a threat to democracy, the rule of law, and a step towards a possible conflict. at the moment when we commemorate 70 years since the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights, 25 years since the adoption of the vienna declaration and program of action, but also 20 years since the declaration on human rights defenders, we are witnessing more and more examples of grave human rights violations around the world. it is unacceptable that we remain silent about this fact. in addressing these situations, we acknowledge the important role of the human rights council, and the need for its more efficient and effective functioning in order to build on the results achieved so far. a strong and determined commitment to a progressive approach to human rights is necessary, as well as improving the application of the highest standards in the protection of human rights at all levels. in the field of protection and promotion of human rights at the national level, significant progress has been made in the protection of women and girls, children, lgbti population, and the integration of marginalized groups. we aim to strengthen and expand the national human rights dialog, which should contribute to a better application of international standards. montenegro's commitment to the issue of gender equality and the fight against violence against women is reaffirmed by our chairmanship of the executive board of the un women. we strongly advocate for the greater role of women as leaders and important decision-makers, stakeholders in conflict prevention, resolution and reconciliation. ladies and gentlemen, although humanitarian challenges are on the rise, i emphasize the importance of defining key multilateral agreements under the auspices of the united nations, i.e. the two global compacts on migration and refugees. adoption of the global compact on migration will contribute to better management of international migration in all dimensions, to the benefit of all states and communities, including migrants. the government is working in all fields to better regulate migration processes. montenegro undertakes all that is necessary for the possible admission of migrants and refugees, in accordance with international standards in this area, while taking into account its national capacities. bearing in mind its experience in the admission of a large number of refugees during the balkan conflicts in the 1990s, montenegro has contributed to defining the global compact on refugees. we believe that the global compact on refugees will contribute to the joint action of the international community in terms of the mass movement of refugees and providing support to the countries of admission. ladies and gentlemen, in the past 12 years since independence restoration, montenegro has made rapid progress in the state-building process based on the lofty democratic values. our results are not just a product of political pragmatism, but a vision of today's montenegro geared towards the stability and prosperity of its citizens. montenegro has been a new member of nato since last year. aware of the necessity of a safe and secure environment, we are committed to the issues of global security, preservation and enhancement of common values, both within nato and in un peacekeeping missions. membership in nato has given us a strong incentive to further strengthen the rule of law based on the highest democratic values. but at the same time we are vigorously implementing the economic reforms that resulted in a high economic growth rate of over 4% in the course of the last year and in the first half of this year. these measures are based on sustainable development that will secure a higher level of living standard in the longer term. at the moment, montenegro is a frontrunner in the western balkans in the process of joining the european union. we have, among other things, earned this position with our multinational and multireligious harmony, which is our historical feature and value. we are committed to strengthening institutions and their sustainability with a determined fight against organized crime and corruption. distinguished excellencies, allow me to draw your attention at the very end to the current situation in the region i come from. the western balkans is now a better place to live than 20 or 30 years ago, owing to the efforts of the international community and the governments of the countries of the region. we in montenegro believe that there is no better future for our countries and citizens than that in the european union. but we are confident that it also comes as a natural choice for europe. european values are the only and best answer to growing nationalism and populism in our view. however, in order to achieve this goal, actions must be taken more decisively with a clear vision of a whole, stable and stronger europe in every corner of it. montenegro has been and will remain committed to promoting regional stability and cooperation and developing good neighborly relations. in that sense, we welcome the signing of the historic agreement between macedonia and greece, which contributes to the european and euroatlantic perspective of the region. we hope for the successful implementation of the agreement reached, which will be conducive to creating a favorable environment for the further overall development of the region. we also welcome the negotiations between belgrade and pristina. we believe that in the coming period it will result in the achievement of a lasting agreement and a full normalization of relations, which is in the interest of both the region and europe. madam president, montenegro will continue to be a responsible partner to the united nations. through membership in the bodies and agencies of the un, it will be contributing to the un's tackling of global challenges. in addition to the membership and montenegro’s chairing of the executive board of the un women, the candidacies have been presented for the upcoming period for membership in the economic and social council 2020-2022, the human rights council 2022-2024 and the un security council 2026-2027 . we believe that we will gain the support and confidence of united nations member states in the aforementioned bodies, which will be an opportunity to contribute to a stronger and more effective un action. the key interests of our countries are shared - more peace, security and prosperity for our citizens. in this respect, the united nations must continue to play a strong role. thank you for your attention.","duško marković, prime minister of montenegro, unequivocally confirmed his government’s commitment to joint action within the united nations system and welcomed the choice of this year’s general assembly debate — “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. joint action is essential in responding to the catastrophic consequences of terrorism, violent extremism and climate change. to address the many challenges facing the world, united nations reform is necessary, he said, adding that the general debate is of paramount importance to ensure confidence in the united nations. montenegro is firmly committed to the implementation of the sustainable development goals; a process he said complements the country’s european integration efforts. although it is responsible for a small share of global emissions, montenegro is committed to implementing the paris agreement. the international community often falls short in preventing crime and suffering. the situations in syria and myanmar point to the relevance of preventive and timely action in avoiding conflict. states have a moral responsibility to eradicate impunity for crimes committed. montenegro regrets the ongoing stalemate in the resolution of the israeli‑palestinian conflict and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza. violence resulting from conflicts in the middle east must end immediately, he asserted, also calling for the strengthening of the united nations prevention pillar. human rights violations pose a threat to democracy, the rule of law and are a step towards conflict, he said. seventy years since the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights, the world is witnessing an increase in grave rights violations. he acknowledged the role of the human rights council in preventing violations, also urging that body to run more effectively and efficiently. significant progress has been made at the national level in the promotion and protection of the rights of women and girls, children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. montenegro’s commitment to gender equality is reaffirmed by its chairmanship of the executive board of united nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women (un-women). pointing to rising humanitarian challenges, he said adoption of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration will contribute to better management of migration flows and will benefit states and migrants. montenegro is working to improve migration‑related regulations and admits migrants and refugees into the country in line with international standards. in the 12 years since the restoration of its independence, montenegro has made rapid progress in the state-building process based on democratic values. he said that as a north atlantic treaty organization (nato) member, montenegro is committed to issues of global security. montenegro is also a front‑runner for european union membership and commits itself to combating crime and corruption. he said the western balkans is now a better place to live than it was some 20 years ago, adding that the best future for the region is in membership to the european union. montenegro continues to promote regional stability and welcomes the historic name‑change agreement between greece and macedonia. montenegro will continue to be a responsible partner to the united nations and to contribute to tackling global challenges. montenegro has presented its candidacy for the upcoming economic and social council, human rights council and security council periods."
Morocco,,"m. saad-eddine el othmani, prime minister of morocco, emphasized that new and innovative approaches are needed to advance multilateralism. international organizations must be made more efficient and capable to adapt to a changing world. spotlighting examples of united nations achievements, he pointed at the first peacekeeping mission and the organization’s important role in the maintenance of international peace and security. emphasizing morocco’s strong commitment to rights, he said the adopting of the universal declaration of human rights opened an avenue for more such instruments. however, he said, the world needs now more than ever before a collective approach to face challenges such as climate change and the question of migration. emphasizing the importance of the paris agreement, he also noted that morocco is playing its role in other areas. his country is fully engaged in efforts to combat terrorism and will host in december an international conference aimed at adopting a global compact on migration. turning to other concerns, he invited the united nations to relaunch a political process regarding the creation of a palestinian state, with east jerusalem as its capital. he also denounced any interference into the internal affairs of arab states, adding that such actions run counter to international rights. on the question of western sahara, he said the conflict is a source of instability. as such, he invited algeria to assume its political and historical responsibilities on the question. “it is clear algeria created this crisis,” he said, adding that morocco supports the secretary-general and his special envoy as well as their initiatives to resolve the conflict."
Mozambique,"republic of mozambique office of the president “making the united nations relevant to all persons: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” statement by his excellency filipe jacinto nyusi, president of the republic of mozambique, at general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. new york, 25th september 2018 madam president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly; mr secretary general of the united nations; your excellencies heads of state and government; excellencies; ladies and gentlemen! it is with a great honor that we address the 73rd session of the united nations on the general debate. we warmly congratulate her excellency maria espinosa garcês, for her election to chair this session of the general assembly which meets under the theme “making the united nations relevant to all persons: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. we would like to assure you, madam president, of mozambique’s full support as you discharge your mandate. we commend the outgoing president, mr miroslav lajčák, for the remarkable success of his tenure during which he was consistently committed in mobilizing the international community for the implementation of agenda 2030 on sustainable development. we want to express our appreciation to the secretary general of the united nations, mr antónio guterres for the dedicated work he has been doing in leading the organization for the cause of international peace and security and sustainable development. allow me also to express our deep condolences for the passing of mr kofi annan, former secretary general of the united nations. annan has honored africa and the world with his dedicated devotion for global just causes. the general assembly, equally, takes place in the year when the icon for the struggle for freedom, peace, equality and fraternity, nelson mandela would turn a hundred 1 years old. nelson mandela and kofi annan are two eminent personalities that should inspire our collective strive for a better world, for peace, prosperity, security and welfare of the peoples. madam president; excellencies! mozambique recognizes the role of the united nations in promoting dialog and upholding the principle of peaceful settlement of conflicts that continue to affect peoples and nations and are the source of human rights violations and hinder inclusive and sustainable development. the united nations is the mother forum for multilateral dialog that brings together commitments of states in the context of implementation of globally assumed agendas and other instruments on the achievement of shared goals. the uneven and fractured world needs multilateralism to overcome its gaps lacunas. the progress made so far, is an unequivocal evidence that the sharing of responsibilities is a global imperative, and an essential vector to building a harmonious, just and peaceful world. i am referring, for instances, to the implementation of the paris agreement on climate change, the efforts aimed at eliminating nuclear weapons, to regulate and humanize migration to avoid humanitarian catastrophes. in the list of multiple examples, i also cite those issues related human rights and good governance, peaceful resolution of conflicts and development financing, among others. in this regard, mozambique supports the secretary general in his efforts to reform the united nations system and make it adequate to its purposes. the country 2 commends his inclusive approach of involving the united nations member states in each stage of the process. in addition to the reforms underway, it is also urgent to fast-rack the security council reforms, an important element that will contribute for the reaffirmation of the relevant role of the united nations in finding sustainable solutions to challenges of peace and security the humanity is faced with. the difficulties to reach consensus among the united nations member states to initiate negotiations on this matter, also limit the capacity of the security council to act, as one the pillars, without which the success in the implementation of the agenda 2030 will be a mirage. these reforms will ensure that the united nations are truly relevant to all peoples, which we all cherish. madam president; ladies and gentlemen! regarding peace and security, mozambique continues to follow with deep concern the prevalence and resurgence of inter and intra state flash points of political instability, particularly in africa and the middle east. we have followed the tension in the korean peninsula, as well as fundamentalism and acts of violent extremism. our country hopes that peace initiatives underway at global level and the actions to contain recruitment and funding of terrorist groups will result into opportunities to promote further the people’s harmonious development the right to self-determination of the people of western sahara and palestine remains a concern of the international community. lack of progress in the referendum on self-determination of the people of western sahara continues to be a source of concern to peace loving people. we believe that the solution to the palestinian problem is based on the existence of two states, side by side, in the light of the principles of international law, namely 3 those related to good neighborliness, peaceful co-existence, dialog and tolerance. mozambique, once again, joins most states present in this hall, in appealing to the normalization of political, diplomatic, economic and financial relations between cuba and the united states of america. excellencies! mozambique has also dedicated efforts to removing the obstacles to peace and promoting inclusiveness and an enabling environment for equitable and sustainable development. commitment to the national constructive dialog has enabled meaningful progress towards the settlement of differences and building an effective, lasting and sustainable peace which provides the necessary environment for the strengthening of national unity, reconciliation and resumption of the country’s economic growth. soon after becoming the mozambican head of state, in january 2015, i decided to personally commit to finding peace for my country. i did so because both my country and the humanity, were still the target of tragic conflicts which proved that all wars always punish peoples. fortunately, for more than two years guns have been silenced in my country, thanks to the direct engagement in dialog with the now late leader of renamo. now there is consensus that everything has been done in my country, peace was the best achievement i recorded as a president. as a result of the dialog, the mozambican nation witnessed in june this year the approval by the national assembly, of the republic of mozambique constitution and the review of the electoral law, and innovative elements were introduced in the 4 decentralization of the country, with a view to reducing post electoral conflicts and deepening of democracy. these steady steps in the political dialog are an indelible milestone in the multiparty system in the country, as we intend to hold the general elections any armed political party like in the previous cycles. therefore, a process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of remnant opposition armed elements. as a proof that mozambique upholds democracy, local elections will be held in 53 municipalities, on the 10th october 2018, with the participation of various political parties and civil society organization. already towards the end of next year general elections will be held within the new consensually agreed framework with the party that engaged in the armed conflict. this framework has been approved by the national assembly. due to the complexity of the matter, in technical and financial terms, the government seizes this solemn opportunity to thank the international community for the support and care. one cannot build with ease what has been destroyed. hence, we appeal that more assistance is rendered so that peace, reconciliation and development can be worked out and the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of remnant armed elements due to be initiated shortly materializes in the country. the mozambican people are determined to live in peace. the government of mozambique is currently committed to fighting organized crime which destabilizes and threatens our efforts of national development, we are determined to neutralize the groups of criminals that are attempting to undermine the order and tranquility in some districts of the north of cabo delgado province. in our measures against these criminals we count on the support of all because this is a repugnant crime of global nature which involves both nationals and nonnationals, who are still faceless and without arguments and tending to spill over to other neighboring countries. 5 we cannot think of democracy, i said, of human rights, when the fundamental human right, the right to life is endangered. madam president! mozambique takes with a deep sense of responsibility, its commitments in relation to the sustainable development goals. it is in this context that our 2015 – 2019 national governing agenda is aligned with the agenda 2030. we are convinced that the implementation of these goals will result in the creation of a fairer, more equitable and solidarity society. these are the premises for the broadening of social justice in our country. our government has made efforts so that the implementation of its national agenda creates opportunities for its citizens and, particularly women and the youth, within the framework of the demographic dividend in our society. “making the united nations relevant to all persons”, presupposes not leaving anyone behind, and it is a theme so important that it should not be neglected. therefore, special attention must be payed to policies and strategies meant to protection and full enjoyment of persons’ rights, promotion of gender equality and equity, as well as the capacity building of women, the youth and other vulnerable people who are the majority of our peoples. as alluded to, social justice, means continuous promotion of gender equality, a field where we have made significant strides at political, economic and corporate level. we have also undertaken efforts to increase access to basic services of health, education, water and sanitation for all populations. 6 another key element to establish the relevance of the united nations to persons is to ensure food and nutrition security, by prioritizing agriculture in our national development strategy. since the inception of the new administration in the country, in 2015, on the basis of domestic resources mobilization and the dedicated efforts of our people, we have been able to substantially increase agricultural, livestock and fisheries production and productivity. in this way, we intend to achieve the goal of sustainable development of ending hunger well before 2030, which requires an increase of public and private investments. regarding the fight against corruption, another evil that undermines the achievement of our global, regional and national goals, our government has promoted and conducted actions with a view to attaining high standards in practices of good governance, in all its dimensions, political, economic and corporate. to this end, we have adopted laws, policies and strategies for a fierce fight against corruption. we continue building institutional and human capacity to ensure the enforcement of anti-corruption laws, as well as to raise awareness of social actors and institutions on the negative impact of this scourge, always abiding by the established principle of separation of powers. in the context of climate change, mozambique, as one of the countries most exposed to this phenomenon, continues to take measures of adaptation and resilience within the framework of the paris agreement, to which we are party since june this year. we have adopted the policy of biodiversity conservation, under which 25% of our national territory is dedicated to conservation. at the same time, we are promoting the development of communities in conservation areas or adjacent areas engaging the communities in the protection and preservation of this valuable natural resource. 7 we have fostered the use of renewable energies in rural areas, sustainable management of natural resources and conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as the sharing of benefits. from this podium we want to call for the international cooperation in terms of financial and technological means to build capacities to complement our own efforts. mr president; ladies and gentlemen! we would like to conclude our remarks by reiterating the government of the republic of mozambique’s unconditional commitment to continue performing its part in the critical role of the united nations to find solutions to problems affecting humankind. the united nations will always be a platform that brings us together around the collective commitment towards the noble ideals on which this universal organization has been founded: “saving future generations from the scourge of war” and “promoting social progress and better living standards in greater freedom”. let us remain faithful to these supreme interests enshrined in the united nations charter and let us work together to build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. thank you very much for your attention! 8","filipe jacinto nyusi, president of mozambique, acknowledged the role of the united nations in promoting dialog and solving conflict, as a forum for multilateral dialog in globally assumed agendas. saying “an unequal and fractured world requires multilateralism to address its gaps”, he cited the implementation of the paris agreement and efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons and to regulate migration. with the promotion of human rights, good governance and financing for development as key points, he called for support of the secretary-general’s reform of the united nations system so the organization can be adequate to its purpose. commending the secretary-general’s inclusive approach, he said member states must resolve differences for more effective cooperation. expressing deep concern for flashpoints and conflicts in africa and the middle east, he said mozambique also follows tensions on the korean peninsula. fighting recruitment and financing of terrorist groups will aid development. his country supports self-determination for western sahara and the two-state solution to resolve the palestinian issue. appealing for the normalization of relations between cuba and the united states, he said that he is personally committed to the search for peace. in his own country, he started dialog that led to consensus and approval of an amendment to the constitution introducing an innovative approach to resolving conflicts, a milestone in the history of his nation, meaning the next elections will be held without armed parties. those elections will prove mozambique’s commitment to democracy, but the country still needs more assistance in disarmament and demobilization. while committed to peace, he resolves to continue the fight against organized crime which threatens development, aiming to neutralize criminals in the northern regions, as we cannot think about human rights when the very right to life is jeopardized. aligning his country’s national agenda with the 2030 agenda, he said this will lead to a just, equitable society and broaden social justice in his nation, particularly for women and youth “and not leaving anyone behind”. social justice requires gender equality, and his country has made significant strides in that domain, also prioritizing access to food, water, nutritional security and sanitation. increasing productivity and livestock will also help achieve the sustainable development goals. while stating that corruption remains a scourge, his government has worked for good governance, strengthening institutions and respecting the separation of powers. as one of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change, he said mozambique continues to take measures in accordance with the paris agreement, devoting 25 per cent of its territory to the conservation of biodiversity, developing renewable energies in rural areas and working to ensure the protection of ecosystems and sharing of benefits. appealing for international cooperation in sharing technological means, and reiterating the unconditional commitment of his country to the critical role of the united nations in solving humanity’s problems, he called for continuing to be “faithful” to those ideals."

of the republic of the union of myanmar, at the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly madame president, i wish to extend sincere congratulations to you on your election as the president of the 73rdsession of the general assembly. we firmly believe that under your able stewardship this session will be fruitful. madame president, we live in challenging times. this year s theme, making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies is, therefore, most appropriate. it serves to remind us of the need to strengthen the role of this important organization to overcome the complex challenges we face today. in this process, we must not forget the core principles of the un charter, including the principle of sovereign equality. it is also important to remember that, the promotion of economic, social, cultural and humanitarian interests, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, are to be attained through international cooperation. nor should we forget the international character of the united nations. it is only through constructive and peaceful approaches that we will be able to create a better united nations one that is relevant to all nations. only then can our hopes for global leadership of shared responsibilities become a reality. here, i wish to stress that myanmar's view on the role of the united nations remains unchanged. there are no suitable multilateral platform other than the united nations for countries of the world to work together to find solutions to overcome global challenges. madame president, let me apprise this august assembly of our efforts to transform myanmar from an authoritarian system to a democratic one; our effort to bring about sustainable development and to build a society where stability, peace, and harmony prevail. a country without peace and stability cannot achieve economic development. this is our conviction. accordingly, our democratically-elected government has given priority to national reconciliation and peace since we assumed office. madame president, we are convinced that ethnic strife and armed conflicts in myanmar can only be ended through political means. lasting peace will become a reality only when the democratic federal union to which our people aspired is established. 2 we are, therefore, conducting negotiations at the union peace conference - the 21stcentury panglong to reach agreement on the fundamental principles for a democratic federal union. the three sessions of the conference held so far have adopted fifty-one fundamental principles which will become part of the union peace accord. to ensure that the process is inclusive, we continue negotiations not only with the eight ethnic armed groups that have signed the nationwide ceasefire agreement (nca) but also with those that have yet to come on board. during the past year, two more ethnic armed groups, namely the new mon state party and the lahu democratic union, joined the peace process by signing the nca. we will continue our endeavors to bring all ethnic armed organizations under the nca umbrella and to the conference table. madame president, essential to our endeavors to bring peace and prosperity to the nation is the need to ensure balanced development in the economic, social and environmental spheres. to this end, the government has laid down the myanmar sustainable development plan - msdp 2018-2030 which is in accord with the united nations 2030 sustainable development agenda. the msdp recognizes three pillars peace and stability, prosperity and partnership, and people and the planet. among its important goals are peace, national reconciliation, security, and good governance. sustainability in all its forms is considered cross-cutting and will be mainstreamed into all aspects of the sdp implementation. the success of msdp requires not only national endeavors but also the involvement and commitment of development partners and international organizations. madame president, human rights and inclusiveness are fundamental to the successful transformation of myanmar into a democratic society. the government has spared no effort in nurturing democratic norms and practices among all its citizens. these efforts include the promotion of the rule of law, good governance and protection of human rights, and the fostering of vibrant civil society. all these are essential for the emergence of a democratic federal union in which the security and prosperity of all citizens are assured. it is a supremely challenging task, particularly for a fledgling democracy. however, myanmar is strong in its resolution to build the democratic society to which our people aspire. madame president, resolving the issue in rakhine is an important component of our democratic process. our government has consistently exerted all efforts to bring peace and development to rakhine. within weeks of the assumption of the responsibilities of the state, the government set up the central committee for implementation of peace, stability, and development of rakhine state in may 2016 under the chairmanship of the state counselor, daw aung san suu kyi. this was followed by the establishment of the advisory commission 3 on rakhine in september 2016, headed by the late dr. kofi annan, former secretary- general of the united nations, to provide recommendations for bringing peace, stability, and development to rakhine state. i wish at this point to pay tribute to dr. kofi annan who with his immense wisdom had provided us with recommendations in his desire for us to reach our goal of peace, prosperity, and security in rakhine state. barely a month after the advisory commission was established, an extremist terrorist group, called aqamul mujahidin (later renamed the arakan rohingya salvation army - arsa) launched attacks on three border police posts in northern rakhine state. the attacks were premeditated, well-organized and designed to invoke fear among the inhabitants, to incite violence and to attract international attention. the government, despite the attacks, continued with its efforts to seek sustainable solutions for rakhine state. the advisory commission presented its final report to the government of myanmar in august 2017. it contains 88 recommendations towards achieving lasting peace and stability in rakhine. we have set up an implementation committee, and i am happy to report that we are now implementing 81 out of 88 recommendations made by the commission. within hours of the release of the advisory commission s final report, arsa terrorists carried out simultaneous attacks on 30 police outposts and one army battalion headquarters. here, it must be stressed that the arsa attacks of 2017 were not only against the security forces but also against various communities inhabiting rakhine state. the attacks opened a chapter of fear and instability that led to a large outflow of refugees to bangladesh. international attention has been focussed on the outflow overlooked the broader picture of the various reasons, immediate as well as longstanding, that brought about the displacement. nevertheless, the government has persisted in its sincere efforts to address as a whole, the need for stability, reconciliation, and development to all communities in rakhine. madame president, we sympathize deeply with these displaced persons especially women and children and have taken steps to effect the early repatriation of all displaced persons from rakhine, who are verified as residents of the state. to this end, we have signed with bangladesh three bilateral agreements, the arrangement on return of displaced persons from rakhine state, terms of reference for the implementation, and its physical arrangement. we have made necessary preparations in line with these bilateral agreements and have been ready to receive verified returnees from bangladesh since 23 january of this year. we call on bangladesh to fulfill its commitments in accordance with the bilateral agreements, to allow, without delay the return of verified persons under voluntary, safe and 4 dignified conditions. a number of people had returned of their own volition and under their own arrangement. they have been systematically registered, processed and are now with their own relatives and families in their own homes. however, not even a single displaced person has been repatriated by bangladesh as part of the implementation of the bilateral agreement. madame president, the only way to resolve the issue swiftly and peacefully is through the implementation of the bilateral agreements, working together in the spirit of good neighborliness, refraining from activities that might be inimical to the national interests of either myanmar or bangladesh. we recognize the crucial role of the united nations in addressing the issue of rakhine and the present humanitarian crisis in particular. accordingly, the government of myanmar signed a mou with the undp and the unhcr for assisting the speedy and efficient resettlement and rehabilitation of returnees. under the mou, the implementation process begins with an assessment that will be conducted by the undp and unhcr in the potential project areas. the un team has started this process, and we are looking forward to their feedback. madame president, the imyanmar government has expressed its serious concerns over the report published on 27 august 2018 by the human rights council's fact finding mission on myanmar. from the very beginning, myanmar objected to the formation of the fact-finding mission, due to our government s serious and genuine concerns about the advisability of its establishment, composition, and mandate. at a time when we are working hard to build harmony on the ground, we are concerned that the release of this report based on narratives and not on hard evidence will only serve to inflame tensions further and potentially hinder our efforts to create the much needed social cohesion in rakhine state. here, i would like to stress what accountability should mean to all of us. accountability should mean taking responsibility for one s actions. accountability must apply equally to all. individuals, organizations, national governments as well as multilateral organizations, must be held responsible for the consequences of their words and actions. madame president, as you will also be aware, the government of myanmar has resolutely rejected the iccs ruling of 6 september 2018 in connection with rakhine state. our position here is clear: myanmar is not a party to the rome statute, and the court has no jurisdiction over myanmar whatsoever. the icc decision was made on dubious legal grounds and applied to a situation here domestic remedies have not yet been exhausted. i speak to all representatives here today when i say that we, the members of the international community, should be deeply concerned by the recent decision of the 5 international criminal court and the various precedents that the court may be setting by this recent ruling as well as by the way in which it was made. such action can only erode the moral and legal authority of the court. we are heartened that we are not alone in having grave misgiving about the icc. madame president, please also let me make it clear, whilst the government is unable to accept this legally dubious intervention by the international criminal court, we are fully committed to ensuring accountability where there is evidence of human rights violations committed in rakhine state. we have recently established an independent commission of enquiry. the commission will investigate all violations of human rights and atrocities committed in rakhine state as part of our efforts to address the issues of accountability, reconciliation, peace, stability, and development in our country. the independent commission of enquiry is chaired by madame rosario manalo, former deputy foreign minister of the philippines, and comprises ambassador kenzo oshima, former japanese pr to the un and under-secretarygeneral of the un, and two myanmar nationals, one of whom is the former chairman of the constitutional tribunal and the other a former senior officials of unicef. we hope that, alongside the rakhine advisory commission's recommendations, the work of the independent commission of enquiry will become an important guiding light for the resolution of long out reached problems in the rakhine state. madame president, the challenges facing myanmar are complex and multifaceted. however, the people of myanmar are resilient. we stand united to face all obstacles and to meet all challenges as we strive to bring peace, development and national harmony to our country that has suffered from decades of conflict, underdevelopment, and disharmony. thank you.","u kyaw tint swe, union minister for the office of the state counselor of myanmar, noted his country’s efforts to transform it from an authoritarian system to a democratic one and its effort to bring about sustainable development and build a society where stability, peace and harmony prevail. the ethnic strife and armed conflicts in myanmar can only be ended through political means. during the past year, two more ethnic armed groups, namely the new mon party and the lahu democratic union, joined the peace process by signing the nationwide ceasefire agreement. “human rights and inclusiveness are fundamental to the successful transformation of myanmar into a democratic society,” he said. resolving the issue in rakhine is an important component of myanmar’s democratic process, he said. barely a month after the advisory commission on rakhine was established, an extremist terrorist group called aqamul mujahidin launched attacks on three border police posts in northern rakhine state. “the attacks were premeditated, well organized and designed to invoke fear among the inhabitants,” he said. the commission’s final report contained 88 recommendations towards achieving lasting peace and stability in rakhine. within hours of its release, terrorists carried out attacks on police and the army, opening a new chapter of fear that led to a large outflow of refugees. “we sympathize deeply with these displaced persons especially women and children and have taken steps to effect the early repatriation of all displaced persons from rakhine, who are verified as residents of the state,” he continued. myanmar has made the necessary preparations in line with bilateral agreements and has been ready to receive verified returnees from bangladesh since 23 january. he called on bangladesh to fulfill its commitments in accordance with bilateral agreements, to allow, without delay, the return of verified persons under voluntary, safe and dignified conditions. several people who have already returned have been registered, processed and are now with their families, he said. he expressed serious concern over the report published on 27 august by the human rights council’s fact‑finding mission on myanmar. from the very beginning, myanmar objected to the formation of the mission due to its government’s serious and genuine concerns over its composition and mandate. “accountability must apply equally to all,” he said, also recalling myanmar’s rejection of the international criminal court’s ruling of 6 september in connection with the rakhine state. his nation is not a party to the rome statute, and the court has no jurisdiction over myanmar whatsoever. such action can only erode the moral and legal authority of the court. while the government is unable to accept this legally dubious intervention, it fully commits to ensuring accountability where there is evidence of human rights violations committed in rakhine state."
Namibia,"republic of namibia tlib^fyj () statement by his excellency dr. mage g. geingob, president of the republic of namibia at the general debate of the 73""^ session of the united nations general assembly september 26, 2018 new york your excellency, ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the 73^^ session ofthe un general assembly; your excellencies, heads of state and government; your excellency, mr. antonio guterres, secretary general ofthe united nations; madame president, i wish to congratulate you on your election as president of the 73^^ session of this august assembly. on july 21, 2018, the people of namibia and our friends around the world, laid to rest our first foreign minister, dr. theo-ben gurirab. he represented our liberation movement, swapo, here at the united nations for over 15 years. under his presidency at the 54^ session ofthe united nations general assembly we adopted the millennium development goals, the precursor to the sustainable development goals. the family ofdr. gurirab,the government and people ofthe republic of namibia, have been deeply touched by the outpouring of condolences and sympathies following his death. we are deeply appreciative ofthe memorial service held in his honor here at the un headquarters. two weeks ago, i traveled to accra for the burial of kofi annan,the 7^ secretary general of this venerable organization - - an african son whose flame has been extinguished, but whose light will shine on through the ages. a few days ago,in this very hall, we gathered to pay tribute to this revered personality and architect of peace. he was a man ofgreat stature, who dedicated his entire adult life towards the pursuit of global peace and security. may the souls of these distinguished sons of africa and the un, rest in eternal peace. madame president, following the end ofthe cold war and the old bi-polar dispensation, the world has slowly drifted ever more worryingly towards unilateral action. this development goes against one offundamental tenets of democracy upon which our organization is built. democracy might have its flaws but it is by far the best system that enables key values ofthe united nations, necessary for sustained inclusive development. it is for this reason that we must embrace multilateralism with greater urgency, to counter unilateral action. it is also for this reason that we fully concur with the secretary general's sentiments as contained in his statement to this assembly that, and i quote,""as today's problems grow ever more global, multilateralism is more important than ever"". the republic of namibia is founded upon the principles of democracy, the rule of law and justice. the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in our constitution include virtually all the rights and freedoms recognized in international human rights instruments. however, these instruments in themselves are not sufficient to bring about sustainable development. namibia recognizes that there are existing and emerging threats, and challenges that continue to fhistrate individual and collective efforts to achieve greater socio economic progress. to this end,namibia has embraced sustainable development and is fully committed to agenda 2030 agenda, its principles, goals, targets and indicators. as a matter offact, namibia has integrated all 17 goals and their targets in its national development plans. as a dry and arid country, often affected by seasonal droughts and floods, we have stepped up our efforts to implement the sdgs in critical areas, such as energy, water and terrestrial ecosystems. in this respect, namibia wishes to benefit from the assistance rendered through the ""technology bank established in istanbul,on 4 june 2018, to enable the timeous identification of spatial locations of drought and flood areas. in july this year, namibia presented its voluntary national review on the implementation of the sdgs. this was namibia's first opportunity to present on progress made in implementing the 2030 agenda on the world stage and as complemented by the au agenda 2063,in pursuance ofthe ""africa we want"". while namibia has witnessed sustained economic growth over much ofthe last ten years, unemployment remains persistently high. nevertheless, namibia has observed one ofthe fastest reductions ofpoverty levels in our region over the last 10 years - from 28.8% to 17.4%. i am also happy to inform that life expectancy in namibia has risen from 58 to 65 years. however, inequality in namibia remains a challenge, as reflected in the skewed ownership of land, where white namibians owns 70 percent of all agricultural land. in our pursuit of creating favorable conditions to fight poverty and maintain peace and stability, namibia will hold its 2""^ national land conference during the first week of october 2018. in preparation for the conference, the government conducted consultations in all our 14 regions, to ensure an inclusive process. we believe in consultation. if diplomacy fails, people go to war. that is why we are pursuing an inclusive consultative process, with the full knowledge that ""inclusivity spells harmony and exclusivity spells conflict."" we have made a concerted effort to include as many stakeholders as possible and to ensure that everything will be done within the ambit of our laws. as a result, we call on our development partners to support the outcome ofthis conference, so as to continue assisting us in the process ofsocio-economic transformation. madame president, i have stated before that namibia's classification, as an upper-middle income nation does not take into account the skewed distribution of income. it prevents us from accessing official development assistance and affordable, concessional fmance. the situation has the potential to jeopardize efforts in namibia and other developing countries to fully achieve agenda 2030. communicable diseases threaten to jeopardize the attainment of agenda 2030. for that reason,namibia endorses the call to end tuberculosis endemic and reaffirms her commitment to unite with the world in achieving this goal. with a population of approximately 2.5 million people,namibia ranks the 9^ highest affected and tb one of the top three causes of hospitalization. the government of namibia has demonstrated its commitment to address tb by including related targets into the 5^ national development plan and also by ensuring that 70% of available funding for tb comes from domestic resources. i should caution that inadequate human and financial resources, high levels ofpoverty, and lack ofpublic health services in rural areas remain a concern. as the chairman of southern african development community (sadc), our region reaffirms its commitment to the declaration, through the ""harmonized surveillance framework for hiv and aids,tuberculosis and malaria"" and resolves to join the international community in the fight against tuberculosis. madame president, i congratulate the secretary general for the launch of the united nation's global youth strategy. africa has the fastest growing youth population. in my capacity as chairperson of sadc,i wish to inform you that the region has adopted a strategy to achieve industrialization by 2063. in ^is regard,the 38^ sadc summit, which took place in august 2018, in windhoek, namibia, adopted the theme,""promoting injfrastructure development and, youth empowerment for sustainable development"". we are convinced that the youth ofthe sadc and indeed ofthe world, are the future custodians ofour social, political, economic and governance infrastructure. as such, the youth needs to be capacitated with requisite skills and training, and economically empowered through entrepreneurship to drive development towards inclusive growth and shared prosperity. the youth ofthe sadc region, like their counterparts in the world, yearn for better prospects. they yearn for a future ofopportunity and job certainty, where the fourth industrial revolution will present opportunity and not threat. a future characterized by rapid advancement oftechnologies, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence and mechanization should present more opportunities for our youth and humanity at large. the onus is on us to understand how these technologies can create opportunities for our youth to become drivers of economic growth and industrial development. madame president, let me emphasize that excluding women from certain spheres of life is to put to waste skills and expertise that can contribute to sustainable development. in this context, we applaud the secretary general for exercising leadership and thus reaching gender parity amongst senior management and resident coordinators. namibia is fully committed to implementing gender equality, which is evident in the important role women play in politics. women are equally represented in our executive and legislature. the participation of women at the highest levels of governance has been consolidated when the ruling swapo party took a principled decision at the 1997 congress to increase the proportion of female delegates to the party's congress up to 50 percent. this was the genesis of the now constitutionally mandated swapo party,zebra style 50/50 policy,a key indicator ofthe importance we attach to gender equality. the late secretary general kofi annan was right when he said,""gender equality is more than a goal in itself. it is a precondition for meeting the challenge ofreducing poverty, promoting sustainable development and building good governance"". the world should do more to make gender equality a reality. while we commend the secretary general for his successful reform initiatives, may i remind this august assembly ofthe historic pledge we all made during the world summit held in 2005; a pledge ""to strengthen the united nations with a view to enhancing its authority and efficiency"" and,to ""address effectively ... the full range ofchallenges ofour time."" it is time to ensure we live up to that pledge. in this regard, it is pertinent to demonstrate the political will ofthe un membership with regards to redressing africa's exclusion from the security council. the world has moved on, the old and unjust order cannot persist. africa and its 1.2 billion inhabitants can no longer be excluded from assuming its place on this primary decision making body. madame president, for africa and, the rest of the developing world, peace is the main foundation and guarantor for sustainable economic growth and development. as leaders, together with the citizenry ofthe great african continent, we need to understand that it is our collective responsibility to maintain peace in order to enable africa to unlock its full potential. every step that advances a peaceful africa should be welcomed. in that vein, we commend his excellency abiy ahmed, the prime minister of ethiopia and his eritrean coxmterpart. his excellency president isaias afwerki for signing an agreement to end the war between their two countries and the subsequent resumption of diplomatic and trade ties. i am confident that this spirit of unity, peace and security, as embodied in the au agenda 2063, would be transplanted tbroughout the horn of africa and all parts afflicted by conflict in africa. namibia is a child ofinternational solidarity, midwifed by the un. we relied on the solidarity of the nations ofthe world to call on south amca to give us our right to self-determination. equally, we call on the implementation of the un resolutions and decisions, which will lead to a positive, peaceful and permanent solution that meets the aspirations and will ofthe people of western sahara. in the same vein, we reaffirm our support for the people of the occupied territory ofpalestine, in their pursuit of self-determination,justice, freedom and independence, through political, diplomatic, peaceful and non-violent means. during the darkest days of our fight for independence, the government and people of cuba came to our aid, shedding their blood for our liberation, resulting in the consequential battle of cuito cuanavale, which led to negotiations, elections and eventually, freedom. it is in this spirit of profound kinship we share with the cuban people that we renew our call for the lifting ofthe decades old, outdated, ineffective and counterproductive economic and financial embargo of cuba. the time is now, for all of us, to demonstrate the leadership required to bring prosperity and peace to all the world's people. it is time to lead in the spirit ofpeace, in the spirit ofequality and in the spirit ofsustainability. it is time to make the united nations relevant to all the world's people. let us seize this unique moment in history. i thank you.","hage g. geingob, president of namibia, said that, since the end of the cold war, “the world has slowly drifted ever more worryingly towards unilateral action”. this development goes against one of the fundamental tenets of democracy upon which the united nations is built. democracy might have its flaws, he noted, but it is by far the best system, enabling the key values of the united nations necessary for sustained inclusive development. it is for this reason that multilateralism must be embraced with greater urgency. namibia is founded upon the principles of democracy, the rule of law and justice, he continued. the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in its constitution include virtually all the rights and freedoms recognized in international human rights instruments. however, these instruments in themselves are not sufficient to bring

complementing the african union agenda 2063, in pursuance of the “africa we want”. however, communicable diseases threaten to jeopardize the attainment of the 2030 agenda, he underscored. for this reason, he endorsed the call to end the tuberculosis endemic and reaffirmed his country’s commitment to unite with the world in achieving this goal. his government has demonstrated its commitment to address tuberculosis by including related targets in its fifth national development plan, as well as by ensuring that 70 per cent of available funding for tuberculosis comes from domestic resources. however, inadequate human and financial resources, high levels of poverty, and lack of public health services in rural areas remain a concern. he emphasized that excluding women from certain spheres

Nauru,,"baron divavesi waqa, president of nauru, said that to be responsive to the needs of every country, the international community must address a systemic bias within the united nations. the population of nauru is a little over 10,000 people, he emphasized, recalling several obstacles he experienced when trying to access support from the united nations. the unique challenges of small island developing states are widely recognized. volatility in commodity markets has outsized impacts on fiscal planning. this coupled with climate change has left nauru and others like it with extremely underdeveloped economies. it is fair to say that the logic of the entire global economic system is driven by the relentless pursuit of “larger and larger scale”, he said. in the name of efficiency, private enterprises expand operations in places with large pools of cheap labor or vast reserves of resources. “they seek out the greatest profit centers and abandon those that underperform,” he continued. “i dare say this logic has permeated the united nations system.” he added: “why wade through all the loan paperwork to replace a small diesel generator when the same number of documents can mobilize funding to transform a much larger energy system?” the smallest countries simply cannot offer the profit potential that private investors are seeking, he said. small can be nimble, however. modest resources can yield transformative impacts. take renewable energy. a few small islands have made enormous progress in the past few years and are looking to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy systems within a decade. nauru is ready to seize the opportunity presented by cheap solar energy and free itself from the expensive burden of fossil fuels. “capacity and resource constraints are the only things holding us back,” he said. nauru has estimated the cost of moving itself to 100 per cent renewable energy at $63 million, he said, emphasizing that financial and capacity-building resources need to be made more accessible. new funding approaches, such as direct access modalities and direct budgetary support, seem to be yielding much better results in small countries. in addition, adequate financing must be available for basic infrastructure, not just for the development fads of the moment. a special representative, supported by a well-resourced staff, is needed to help us start managing climate risks more effectively, he said. there is a critical gap in the united nations system that must be filled immediately, he continued. building a more inclusive united nations also requires addressing the most urgent global challenges, which include the security implications of climate change. making the united nations relevant means including the people of taiwan, who must be treated equally with the people of other nations."
Nepal,"statement by the ri ht honor ble k.p. sharm oli, prime minister and the leader of nepali delegation to the 73rd sessio of united nations general assembly new york, 27 september 2018 madam president, i extend warm felicitations to you on your election to the presidency of this assembly. the outgoing president deserves our appreciation for successfully steering the assembly s work. we commend the secretary general, mr. antonio gutteres, for the dedication, commitment and leadership with which he has been serving the organization. , as we commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of nelson mandela, i would like to pay my profound respect to him and for the cause he fought for. an iconic figure, he was a great human soul and remains a source of inspiration for peace, justice, harmony, forgiveness and reconciliation. this year we have lost an outstanding diplomat and visionary secretary general kofi annan. i also pay sincere tributes for the tremendous contributions he made to promote peace, development and human rights in the world. madam president, i bring greetings and best wishes from the land of buddha and sagarmatha also known as mount everest for the success of this session. since i addressed from this podium in 2006, nepal has undergone historic political transformation. through dialog and deliberations, through mutual respect and accommodation, we steered a uniquely successful home-grown, nationally led and owned peace process. it was about peaceful transformation of an armed conflict. it was about restructuring of the state and promoting unity in diversity; it was about making nepali people truly sovereign and as source of state power; and ' it was about institutionalizing and consolidating all those achievements . in a democratic constitution through a popularly elected constituent assembly. despite the diffic lties in the wake of devastating earthquakes, the political leaders rose to the occasion with a common resolve to promulgate the constitution in september 2015, thereby fulfilling the seven-decade long people s aspiration to write their own constitution. the constitution of nepal not only consolidates democratic polity under a federal republican order, but also embodies extensive rights and freedoms of the people. separation of power, checks and balances, the rule of law, independence of judiciary, periodic elections, inclusive and proportional representation are the defining features of the constitution. our vision is of a comprehensi e democracy that empowers individuals not only politically but also socially, economically and culturally. implementing the constitution was another paramount task before us. we accomplished this historic task last year through free, fair and impartial elections of federal, provincial and local levels with record turnout and the participation of the people from all sections of our society. most importantly, the elections brought 41 percent of women into elected bodies. we remain committed to bridging the gap of the remaining 9 percent. the elections not only ensured democratic rights of nepali people in the widest possible manner, it has also produced a strong government in many years. the government that i head has over th ee-fourth support of the parliament. governments in the provinces also enjoy strong majority support. we have achieved much needed political stability through these landmark elections. with these historic achievements, we have laid the foundation towards creating an egalitarian and just society where all citizens are treated equally and receive equal protection and opportunities. social justice remains at the center of our polity. the united nations and the international community supported our peace process for which we are grateful. nepal s case is a unique exam le of peaceful and democratic transformation. it is a telling testimony that dialog triumphs the differences; and ballot triumphs the bullets. we believe that what nepal has achieved in conflict transformation can be an inspiring success story for many people longing for peace in different parts of the world. we are willing to share our experiences and provide our insights. with hard lessons lea ed in the arduous journey of democratic transition, we have now emerged as a confident nation, capable of sustaining political gains and undertaking a course for economic transformation. cognizant of the need for accelerating the process of development, my government has set a vision for 'prosperous nepal and happy nepali'. we will realize this vision with the right mix of prudent utilization of natural resources and the optimal mobilization and management of human resources that we are endowed with. we count on continued goodwill, support and cooperation from the international community in our development endeavors. our foreign policy guides us to maintain amity with all and enmity with none. it has shaped our independent outlook on global issues which we consider on merit basis. . 7 we believe that regional and global efforts complement our national development efforts. in line with our foreign policy priority to regional cooperation we have recently hosted the 4th summit meeting of bimstec. we would like to see a revitalized saarc as an important regional organization. excellencies, the world today is at an important juncture; with a unique juxtaposition of perils and promises. challenges ranging from poverty, terrorism, climate change, food insecurity, forced displacement and natural disasters to arms race continue to confront the global community. intra sate conflicts have taken heavy toll on millions of lives. for the first time in decades, world hunger is rising after a prolonged decline. 8 in many regions, peace remains obscure. inequality within nations, as well as among them, is increasing. countries have failed to adopt sustainable production and consumption patterns. in this context, the theme of the general debate making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies resonates well the need of our time. madam president, nepal supports the seven priority areas that you eloquently outlined in your inaugural address to this assembly earlier this week. i hope the current session will seriously deliberate on these priority areas with seriousness and urgency they deserve. here lies our political will and determination. with this commitment we must ensure that the voice of the people struggling for their rights, liberty, freedom and j stice in various parts of the world, including syria, yemen, palestine, and many other places must be heard and addressed. madam president the p rsuit of making the un relevant to all people is well captured in the philosophy of heaving no one behind . in its third year, global efforts in the implementation of the 2030 agenda appear too few and far insufficient. needless to say, the least developed countries are the battleground on which the 2030 agenda will be won or lost. 10 development in ldcs appears dismal despite a record performance of global economy. inte ational support measures are failing to make a dent. implementation of the internationally agreed commitments made in their favor is far below our expectation. reaching furthest behind first is not a luxury. it is not a charity either. it is an international obligation, a duty and social responsibility. the impact will be fully realized only when external support measures respect national ownership and leadership, are aligned with national priorities, come through national system, while they help build productive capacity, job creation and develop human resources. 11 only through smooth access to market, removal of trade barriers, injecting finance and investment, building capacity and transfer of technology and overcoming the infrastructural bottlenecks can enable ldcs and lldcs take path to sustainable development and integrate themselves in the global value chains. ladies nd gentlemen, when it comes to climate change; the clock of caution is ticking loud. the impact of climate change burdens the poorest and the most vulnerable countries, like my own country nepal, despite their negligible emission. we cannot remain a bystander when snow-clad mountains, known as water towers of the world, are receding and glaciers are retreating, erratic weather patte s causing floods and inundation in the plains. it is an unpleasant irony that we have been victim of the catastrophes that we did not contribute for its causality. 12 the impacts of climate change on mountain and small island countries have been felt as existential threat. the loss of lives, properties and bio-diversity, and increasing phenomenon of calamities are becoming untenable. a matching and robust response is required. we cannot evade from the responsibility nor will there be any excuse for inaction. we must act decisively in ensuring climate justice that respects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. to make this happen, international cooperation and collaboration for adaption and mitigation is sine qua non. the paris agreement must be implemented in its entirety and good faith. 13 madam president, the health and wellbeing of our children and youths is an investment for future. delivering quality education, imparting skills, and spurring innovation can make a virtuous composite to enable youths to be relevant and be able to contribute to society and nation building. we must support for the full development of their potentials, their creativity and energy to flourish. inculcating entrepreneurial spirit and creating decent job opportunities for the youths can fuel economic development and help positively transform our societies. at the same time, we must also inculcate them with the civil and moral values so that they become a force for harmony and tolerance in society. 14 madam preside t, ¦ the frontiers of technologies are ever expanding, and they have been major driving force for societal transformation. but the digital dividend is unevenly distributed, while the digital divide is widening. technology has been a owerful agent of change and transformation. at the same time, technological revolution is disruptive. the developing countries, especially ldcs, are struggling to cope with the new modes of production and consumption. we must create an environment to ensure easy access to affordable technology and free the barriers for their transfer. this will provide a level playing field to all countries to benefit and propel economic growth through new technologies. 15 e cellencies, this year, the un has taken boldest of the reform initiatives in decades. the cross-pillar restructuring of the organization gives us an important opportunity to strengthen its development pillar and prove its efficiency in delivery. we believe that the repositioned un development system will better deliver on 2030 agenda. to ensure a sound system, learning the new methods by a new generation of country teams is important. but more than that, unlearning the old habits - that implored us to undertake this reform - is equally important. what matters also in the reform is the transformation of the culture. the new culture must have accountability, transparency and national ownership at its core. 16 nepal welcomes the reforms undertaken in peace and security architecture as well as management of the organization. im should reflect the mosaic of its membership, and achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness. the security council reform is long overdue. any reform must reflect the current realities and ensure justice to historically under-represented and developing countries. ladies nd gentlemen, nepal reaffirms its principled stand for a general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. in this context, we welcome the recent efforts made by the united states and two koreas towards denuclearization and peace and stability of the korean peninsula. 17 nepal welcomes the secretary general's agenda for disarmament with a hope of renewed impetus to disarmament. nepal commends the beginning of deliberations under the kathmandu process for developing innovative confidence building measures in the asia pacific region. no region is immune from the menace of terrorism. nepal strongly condemns all acts of terrorism, committed by whomsoever and for whatever purposes. nepal calls for an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention against terrorism. madam president, never has been the issue of human mobility so prominent in the agenda of the united nations. nepal looks forward to the december conference for the formal adoption of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. 18 ensuring human rights and wellbeing of all migrant workers remain our priority. nepal believes that the compact will serve this purpose and make migration work for all. nepal has hosted thousands of refugees for decades on a humanitarian ground. the international community must uphold the refugees right to return to their homeland safely and with full dignity. madam president, the complexities and intractability of global conflicts render the current thrust on conflict prevention even more important. mediation, an under-utilized tool, can be applicable in all phases of the conflict continuum. nepal recently marked the six decades of partnership for peace with the un. nepal has responded to every call, even at the shortest notice and without national caveats. 19 nepal welcomes the secretary general's initiative of action for peacekeeping7 and has endorsed the declaration on peacekeeping operations. troops and police contributing countries must be given fair opportunities to serve at the leadership positions both in the headquarters and the field missions. a sustained partnership for capacity building of peacekeepers and providing for their safety and security can enhance performance of peace operations. nepal condemns attacks on peacekeepers. ending the indignity of sexual exploitation and abuse is a must. nonetheless, peace missions alone cannot substitute the home-grown preventive as well as conflict resolution measures. our own experience tells that peacekeeping cannot do what the politically negotiated settlements can. 20 excellencies, nepal s commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights is total and unfli ching. we hold that development, democracy and respect for human rights as - interdependent ' and mutually reinforcing. as- a member of the human rights council, we will continue to play our constructive role to deliver on councils mandates. the ongoing transitional justice process in nepal respects the comprehensive peace accord as well as the ground reality for sustaining peace and delivering justice. we will not allow impunity in serious violations of human rights and humanitarian laws. 21 mad m president, we are living in an uncertain world. cold-war rivalries are re-surfacing. trade tensions are building up. multilateralism is being questioned. the secretary general s opening statement largely captures the realities of contemporary world and the sentiment of the member states; be it in the field of peace and security or in sustainable development, climate change, migration and technology. we underscore the centrality of the united nations as the most legitimate multilateral forum to deliberate on the challenges that we all confront globally. it is the obligation of all member states to preserve the sanctity of multilateralism and uphold respect for international law. the problems that we confront today at global scale can only be overcome by global collaboration and partnership in absolute trust and confidence. 22 we are yet to make international system truly inclusive that promotes fairness, equality and justice for all states, bigger or smaller. before i conclude, madam president, let me reiterate nepal s profound commitment to the principles and purposes enshrined in the un charter. we remain as firm as we have been in past 63 years since we joined this organization the onus to give direction to the world lies on us. our collective wisdom and leadership should aim at the realization of aspiration of all for peace and prosperity. let us make a collective resolve that the 21st century history will not be written as a history of confrontation and conflict; of poverty, exclusion and under¬ development; of injustice and exploitation. 23 it s ould rather be a history of cooperation and harmony* of prosperity, inclusion and development; and of justice and fairness. thank you. ' 24","k. p. sharma oli, prime minister of nepal, said his country had undergone a historic political transformation since 2006, a home‑grown peace process transforming armed conflict, restructuring the state and making nepali people truly sovereign. despite difficulties in the wake of devastating earthquakes, political leaders implemented a new constitution, with elections bringing women’s representation in elected bodies up to 41 per cent. “we remain committed to bridging the gap of the remaining 9 per cent,” he added. nepal’s conflict transformation can serve as an inspiration for those longing for peace all over the world. while nepal’s foreign policy aims for “amity with all and enmity with none”, the world is at an important juncture facing many challenges including poverty, terrorism, climate change, food insecurity, forced displacement and intra‑state conflicts, he said. in that context, people struggling for rights, liberty, freedom and justice, including in syria, yemen and palestine, must be heard. calling global implementation of the 2030 agenda insufficient, he specified least developed countries as its battleground. describing implementation of internationally agreed commitments as “far below our expectation”, he said sustainable development for least developed countries and landlocked least developed countries requires smooth access to markets, removal of trade barriers, financing and investment, transfer of technology and overcoming infrastructural bottlenecks. noting that climate change burdens poorer, vulnerable countries like nepal, where snow‑clad mountains, known as water towers of the world, are receding and the impact on mountain and small island countries presents an existential threat, he said a matching and robust response is required, including implementation of the entirety of the paris agreement. while the frontiers of technology are ever expanding, he also saw a widening digital divide. least developed countries need easy access to affordable technology to create a level playing field. nepal reaffirms its support for general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, welcoming recent efforts towards denuclearization of the korean peninsula and commending the beginning of the kathmandu process in the asia‑pacific region. hoping for the formal adoption of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, he noted nepal has hosted thousands of refugees for decades and said the international community must uphold the right of refugees to safely return home with full dignity. nepal has responded to every united nations peacekeeping call “even at the shortest notice and without national caveats”. welcoming the secretary‑general’s action for peacekeeping initiative, he condemned attacks on peacekeepers and the indignity of sexual exploitation and abuse. however, nepal’s experience shows that peacekeeping cannot do what politically negotiated settlements can. declaring a total, unflinching commitment to human rights, he also underscored the centrality of the united nations as a multilateral forum, as global problems can only be overcome by global solutions."
Netherlands,"[] m ^*1*.ij\<** general assembly seventy- third session speech by h.e. mr. mark rutte, prime minister of the netherlands, new york, 26 september 2018 madam president, your excellencies, colleagues and fellow delegates. ladles and gentlemen, [introduction] in 1999, in his message for the new millennium, the late kofi annan spoke words whose truth still resonates almost two decades later. 'more than ever before in human history', he said, 'we share a common destiny. we can master it only if we face it together. and that, my friends. is why we have the united nations.' (...) mr annan's legacy is one of international cooperation. of fighting illiteracy, poverty. inequality and climate change as root causes of conflict and human rights violations. above all, his is a legacy of hope, and a firm belief that progress is the unifying theme in human history. the millennium development goals proved him right. and it's up to us, the leaders of the united nations of the world, to carry this legacy forward and make the sustainable development goals and the paris climate agreement a reality. the kingdom of the netherlands remains firmly committed to international cooperation. in fact, we have enshrined this commitment in article 90 of our constitution, which states: the government shall promote the development of the international legal order.' this provision reflects our moral compass. but it also reflects our history as an open, seafaring, trading nation. and the fact that our kingdom consists of four countries in europe and the caribbean: aruba, curagao, the netherlands and st maarten. so we have understood for many centuries the necessity and benefits of a transnational outlook. [multilateralism is not optional] and that is my core message today. we need a transnational outlook to master the challenges we face. there is no conflict between multilateralism and the national interest. on the contrary. after all, what country does not benefit from a stable and secure international environment? from free and fair world trade? from peace instead of armed conflict? from prosperity instead of poverty? from equality instead of inequity? and what country can achieve these goals alone? these are rhetorical questions, of course. we should acknowledge that and act accordingly, which means we must embrace multilateralism. to the people of the kingdom of the netherlands this has only become more evident in the aftermath of the downing of flight mh17. it remains an open wound for my country, and for all grieving nations who had nationals on board. we are grateful for the support of the international community, as expressed in security council resolution 2166. and we hope that together we will see justice done. in may this year, the joint investigation team presented conclusive evidence about the origin of the missile launcher that was used to down the aircraft. this has only bolstered our resolve that, in the interest of the victims and their loved ones, the full truth must be uncovered, justice served and responsibility accepted. in accordance with security council resolution 2166, we call on all states to fully cooperate with ongoing efforts to this end. there can be no doubt that the rules-based multilateral order that arose after the second world war has brought great things for many people. that goes especially for the un and this general assembly. and yet, for many other countries and peoples, this global order has not brought the same benefits. in many parts of the world, peace, stability and prosperity cannot be taken for granted. the multilateral system is not perfect, and it is under pressure. the playing field is changing as we speak. some countries, for a range of reasons, have begun to embrace a different approach. more and more often, sadly, compromise is being rejected in favor of polarization and perceived self-interest. we are witnessing a worrisome trend: some countries are shifting from a constructive to a combative approach in the multilateral environment. what's more, rising repression, human rights violations and shrinking freedom worldwide are a grave concern. accountability is often lacking. and when the multilateral system becomes paralyzed, it is innocent people who suffer. syria is a case in point. in his last annual report secretary-general guterres wrote: 'working together multilaterally is not optional; it is the only answer.' and i fully agree. i believe in constructive multilateralism. i believe in the power of principles and not the principles of power, to guide us towards a better future for more people. and our best - perhaps even our only - way forward is not to give in to defeatism and cynicism, but to keep working to improve the system, step by step. [un reforms: making the system work] in that connection, let me emphasize once again that the kingdom of the netherlands firmly supports the secretarygeneral's reform agenda. and that we applaud its first results. the recent agreement on un reforms sends a strong message of broad support for change. but, as always, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. now we have to put words into action. and by 'we' i mean the un itself and the member states. the un system must be made fit-for-purpose to deliver on the 2030 sustainable development agenda, which is the ultimate prevention agenda. take the staggering number of three thousand separate un offices around the world. that's three thousand arguments for those who say that multilateralism just creates fragmentation and bureaucracy. and they are not entirely wrong. un reform should bring down this number by at least a thousand, through co-locatlon, use of common premises and services, and stronger collaboration. that's a thousand arguments for improving multilateralism. and this is just one example of the broader effort that is required to help the secretary-general's reform drive succeed. another important initiative is the secretary-general's action for peacekeeping agenda. peacekeeping is at the heart of the un, and we need to keep this instrument up to date. reforms within the secretariat and in missions in the field, like the introduction of rotation schemes, will help make peacekeeping missions more effective. member states, for their part, will have to match their words with deeds and money. supporting change is not a free lunch. that's why, for example, the kingdom of the netherlands was the first member state to announce funding for a reformed resident coordinator system that will raise the efficiency of the un development system. and it's why, earlier this week, i transferred the intellectual property rights of the dutch travel information portal to the united nations. this system, which maps the travel movements of terrorists and organized crime syndicates, will now be accessible to all member states. it's practical steps like these which improve the un. our un. and when we look at the un institutions we must not mince our words. we must tell it like it is. sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment committed by people working for un missions and organizations is unacceptable. in every case and in every place. no exceptions. this kind of misconduct undermines the core principles of the un and - as the secretary-general has rightly pointed out - zero tolerance is the only possible response. so we must put the new policies in place without hesitation, and act on them. we must make sure that victims feel heard and supported, and that whistle-blowers are protected. the un is meant to save and improve lives, not destroy them. here we must draw a clear line. [climate resilience and water management: the integrated approach] of course. improving the multilateral system is not only about institutions and organizing principles. these are only means to an end. above all it's about what we do and why we do it. over the years we've gradually learned that the only way to solve problems is to tackle their root causes. we've learned that systematically reducing poverty demands more than money alone. that ending an armed conflict takes more than blue helmets alone. that gender equality and education are essential for peace and development. and that sustalnablllty, climate resilience and international stability go hand in hand. the sustainable development goals are built on this concept of integrated thinking and action. which brings me to a topic that is very important to me personally and to the kingdom of the netherlands: water management and adapting to climate change. the global water crisis affects us all, in the form of increasing droughts, floods or pollution. as a member of the former high-level panel on water, i hope that the agenda for water action we presented earlier this year will inspire others to scale up their action on water. we need to give the value of water greater weight in the economic, social, environmental and other choices we make. for the kingdom of the netherlands, this is self-evident. amsterdam airport is the only airport in the world that lies below sea level. over four meters below sea level. in fact. so you can imagine that rising sea levels and the increase in extreme weather are of serious concern to us. as they are for the caribbean parts of our kingdom, which are especially vulnerable during the hurricane season. it goes without saying that we welcome the recent announcement of a new global commission on adaptation. we are proud to be hosting the launch event in my home town of the hague on october 16th. and of course we are looking forward to next year's climate summit in new york. it should provide a platform to delve deeper into the links between climate resilience, financing and security. because climate and water are, by their nature, issues that can only be dealt with multilaterally, using an integrated approach. the paris agreement and sdg 13 set clear objectives. but water cuts across all the sdgs. what we need now is international transparency, fair market mechanisms and a level playing field, so that all countries can do their part in adapting to climate change. [conclusion] your excellencies, ladies and gentleman. during last year's election of dutch un youth representatives, the young candidates were asked what global issue they would address first if elected. 10 you might expect an answer like 'world peace', 'eradicating poverty' or 'ending war'. but one of them said, 'i would tackle cynicism first. we can change things. but we have to believe we can. to roll up our sleeves and get started. cynicism will get us nowhere.' (...) i think we should take inspiration from those words. it's easy to be cynical and criticize the multilateral system. it's harder to make improvements and reforms that will take us forward, step by step. but constructive multilateralism is the only way to make progress. that's what we are working for. and not only as a member of the security council until december 31st, but also afterwards, and in other international fora. to that end, the kingdom of the netherlands will stand as a candidate for the human rights council for the 2020 to 2022 term. we will proceed in the spirit of kofi annan, who once said, 'we need to keep hope alive and strive to do better.' thank you. 11","mark rutte, prime minister of the netherlands, recalled the late secretary-general kofi annan’s legacy of hope and the firm belief in progress as a unifying theme in human history as in the millennium development goals. taking his legacy forward, he said: “we have to make the sustainable development goals and the paris agreement a reality.” he reiterated his commitment to international cooperation, pointing out that the netherlands have it enshrined in article 90 of their constitution. stressing that multilateralism is not optional, he underlined the need for a transnational outlook to master current challenges, noting that there is no conflict between multilateralism and national interests. on a different note, he said that the downing of the flight mh17 remains an open wound for the netherlands and all grieving nations concerned, appreciating the support of the international community as expressed in security council resolution 2166 (2014) and pointing to their resolve to uncover the full truth, serve justice and accept responsibilities. he regretted the fact that even though the rules-based multilateral order brought great things for many people, this is not the case for many others. while acknowledging that the system is not perfect, he pointed out that compromise is being rejected in favor of polarization and perceived self-interest. he voiced his concern about rising repression, human rights violations and shrinking freedom worldwide, citing syria as a consequence of a paralyzed multilateral system. applauding the first results of the united nations reform, he stressed that the organization must be made fit-for-purpose to deliver on the 2030 agenda. he suggested that the united nations reduce the number of its 3,000 offices around the world by at least 1,000 through colocation. on the action for peacekeeping agenda of the secretary-general, he urged to keep the instrument up-to-date as peacekeeping is at the heart of the united nations and its reforms will make its missions more effective. “supporting change is not a free lunch”, he said, noting that the netherlands were the first member state to announce funding for a reformed resident coordinator system raising the efficiency of the united nations development system. he said that he transferred the intellectual property rights of the dutch travel information portal to the united nations, thus allowing access to all member states to the system mapping the travel movements of terrorists and organized crime syndicates. on sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment committed by organization staff, he underscored that this is unacceptable and there must be no exceptions, quoting the secretary-general’s zero-tolerance policy. victims must be heard and supported and whistle-blowers must be protected. solving problems is to tackle root causes, he said. “we need to give the value of water greater weight in the economic, social and environmental choices,” he said. he stressed that water management and adapting to climate change are highly important for the netherlands, referring to the agenda for water action they presented earlier in 2018. welcoming the new global commission on adaptation, he noted that it should provide a platform to delve deeper into the links between climate resilience, financing and security, using an integrated approach. the paris agreement and sustainable development goal 13 set clear objectives, but water cuts across all 17 goals, he said. he stressed the need for international transparency, fair market mechanisms and a level playing field for all countries to be able to adapt to climate change. lastly, he reiterated that constructive multilateralism is the only way to make progress, and furthermore, he announced netherlands’ candidacy for the human rights council for the 2020 to 2022 term."
New Zealand,"t ""^ •*' \ • '•: v'»* new zealand permanent mission to the united nations te mangai o aotearoa united nations general assembly, session new zealand statement delivered by right honorable jacinda ardern prime minister of new zealand 27 september 2018 new zealand e nga mana nul o nga whenua o te ao tena koutou katoa nei ra te reo mihl maioha o aotearoa tena tatau i nga kaupapa korero ka arahina e tatau me te ngakau pono me te kotahitanga o te tangata madam president, mr secretary-general, friends in the global community. my opening remarks were in te reo maori, the language of the indigenous people of aotearoa new zealand. as is tradition, i acknowledged those who are here, why we are here, and the importance of our work. it seems a fitting place to start. i'm struck as a leader attending my first united nations general assembly by the power and potential that resides here. but in new zealand, we have always been acutely aware of that. we are a remote nation at the bottom of the south pacific. our nearest neighbors take 3 hours to reach by plane, and anywhere that takes less than 12 hours is considered close. i have no doubt though, that our geographic isolation has contributed to our values. we are a self-deprecating people. we're not ones for status. we'll celebrate the local person who volunteers at their sports club as much as we will the successful entrepreneur. our empathy and strong sense of justice is matched only by our pragmatism. we are, after all, a country made up of two main islands - one simply named north and the other. south. for all of that, our isolation has not made us insular. in fact, our engagement with the world has helped shape who we are. i am a child of the 80's. a period in new zealand's history where we didn't just observe international events, we challenged them. whether it was apartheid in south africa, or nuclear testing in the pacific, i grew up learning about my country and who we were, by the way that we reacted to international events. whether it was taking to the streets or changing our laws, we have seen ourselves as members of a community, and one that we have a duty to use our voice within. i am an incredibly proud new zealander, but much of that pride has come from being a strong and active member of our international community, not in spite of it. and at the heart of that international community, has been this place. emerging from a catastrophic war, we have collectively established through convention, charters and rules a set of international norms and human rights. all of these are an acknowledgement that we are not isolated, governments do have obligations to their people and each other, and that our actions have a global effect. in 1945, new zealand prime minister peter eraser said that the un charter offered perhaps a last opportunity to work in unison to realize the hope in the hearts of all of us, for a peace that would be real, lasting, and worthy of human dignity. but none of these founding principles should be consigned to the history books. in fact, given the challenges we face today, and how truly global they are in their nature and impact, the need for collective action and multilateralism has never been clearer. and yet, for all of that, the debate and dialog we hear globally is not centered on the relevance and importance of our international institutions. instead, we find ourselves having to defend their very existence. that surely leaves us all with the question, how did we get here, and how do we get out? if anything unites us politically in this place right now it is this - globalization has had a massive impact on our nations and the people we serve. while that impact has been positive for many, for others it has not. the transitions our economies have made have often been jarring, and the consequences harsh. and so amongst unprecedented global economic growth, we have still seen a growing sense of isolation, dislocation, and a sense of insecurity and the erosion of hope. as politicians and governments, we all have choices in how we respond to these challenges. we can use the environment to blame nameless, faceless 'other', to feed the sense of insecurity, to retreat into greater levels of isolationism. or we can acknowledge the problems we have and seek to fix them. generational change in new zealand, going it alone is not an option. aside from our history, we are also a trading nation. and proudly so. but even without those founding principles, there are not just questions of nationhood to consider. there are generational demands upon us too. it should hardly come as a surprise that we have seen a global trend of young people showing dissatisfaction with our political systems, and calling on us to do things differently - why wouldn't they when they themselves have had to adapt so rapidly to a changing world. within a few short decades we now have a generation who will grow up more connected than ever before. digital transformation will determine whether the jobs they are training for will even exist in two decades. in education or the job market, they won't just compete with their neighbor, but their neighboring country. this generation is a borderless one - at least in a virtual sense. one that increasingly see themselves as global citizens. and as their reality changes, they expect ours to as well - that we'll see and understand our collective impact, and that we'll change the way we use our power. and if we're looking for an example of where the next generation is calling on us to make that change, we need look no further than climate change. global challenges two weeks ago. pacific island leaders gathered together at the pacific islands forum. it was at this meeting, on the small island nation of nauru, that climate change was declared the single biggest threat to the security of the pacific. please, just think about this for a moment. of all of the challenges we debate and discuss, rising sea levels present the single biggest threat to our region. for those who live in the south pacific, the impacts of climate change are not academic, or even arguable. they are watching the sea levels rise, the extreme weather events increase, and the impact on their water supply and food crops. we can talk all we like about the science and what it means, what temperature rises we need to limit in order to survive, but there is a grinding reality in hearing someone from a pacific island talk about where the sea was when they were a child, and potential loss of their entire village as an adult. our action in the wake of this global challenge remains optional. but the impact of inaction does not. nations like tuvalu, the marshall islands, or kiribati - small countries who've contributed the least to global climate change - are and will suffer the full force of a warming planet. if my pacific neighbors do not have the option of opting out of the effects of climate change, why should we be able to opt out of taking action to stop it? any disintegration of multilateralism - any undermining of climate related targets and agreements - aren't interesting footnotes in geopolitical history. they are catastrophic. in new zealand we are determined to play our part. we will not issue any further offshore oil and gas exploration permits. we have set a goal of 100% renewable energy generation by 2035, established a green infrastructure fund to encourage innovation, and rolled out an initiative to plant one billion trees over the next 10 years. these plans are unashamedly ambitious. the threat climate change poses demands it. but we only represent less than 0.2% of global emissions. that's why, as a global community, not since the inception of the united nations has there been a greater example of the importance of collective action and multilateralism, than climate change. it should be a rallying cry to all of us. and yet there is a hesitance we can ill afford. a calculation of personal cost, of self-interest. but this is not the only challenge where domestic self-interest is the first response, and where an international or collective approach has been diluted at best, or rejected at worst. rebuilding multilateralism but it would be both unfair and naive to argue that retreating to our own borders and interests has meant turning our backs on a perfect system. the international institutions we have committed ourselves to have not been perfect. but they can be fixed. and that is why the challenge i wish to issue today is this - together, we must rebuild and recommit to multilateralism. we must redouble our efforts to work as a global community. we must rediscover our shared belief in the value, rather than the harm, of connectedness. we must demonstrate that collective international action not only works, but that it is in all of our best interests. we must show the next generation that we are listening, and that we have heard them. connectedness but if we're truly going to take on a reform agenda, we need to acknowledge the fallings that led us to this cross road. international trade for instance, has helped bring millions of people out of poverty around the world. but some have felt their standard of living slide. in new zealand, we ourselves have seen the hesitancy around trade agreements amongst our own population. the correct response to this is not to repeat mistakes of the past and be seduced by the false promises of protectionism. rather, we must all work to ensure that the benefits of trade are distributed fairly across our societies. we can't rely on international institutions to do this. in the same way as we cannot blame them ifthey haven't delivered these benefits. it is incumbent on us to build productive, sustainable. inclusive economies, and demonstrate to our peoples that when done right. international economic integration can make us all better off. and if we want to ensure anyone is better off, surely it should be the most vulnerable. in new zealand we have set ourselves an ambitious goal. we want to be the best place in the world to be a child. it's hardly the stuff of hard and fast measures - after all, how do you measure play, a feeling of security, happiness? but we can measure material deprivation, and we can measure poverty, and so we will. and not only that, we are making it lawthat we report on those numbers every single year alongside our budgets. what better way to hold ourselves to account, and what better group to do that for than children. but if we are focused on nurturing that next generation, we have to equally worry about what it is we are handing down to them too - including our environment. in the maori languagethere is a word that captures the importance of that role - kaitiakitanga. it means guardianship. the idea that we have been entrusted with our environment, and we have a duty of care. for us, that has meant taking action to address degradation, like setting standards to make our rivers swimmable, reducing waste and phasing out single-use plastic bags, right through to eradicating predators and protecting our biodiversity. the race to grow our economies and increase wealth makes us all the poorer if it comes at the cost of our environment. in new zealand, we are determined to prove that it doesn't have to be this way. but these are all actions and initiatives that we can take domestically that ease the blame and pressure on our international institutions. that doesn't mean they don't need fixing. reforming the un as the heart of the multilateral system, the united nations must lead the way. we strongly support the secretary-general's reform efforts to make the un more responsive and effective, modernized so that it is capable of dealing with today's challenges. we encourage him to be ambitious. and we stand with him in that ambition. but ultimately it is up to us - the member states - to drive change at the un. this includes reforming the security council. if we want the council to fulfill its purpose of maintaining international peace and security, its practices need to be updated so it is not hamstrung by the use of the veto. new thinking will also be needed if we are to achieve the vision encapsulated in the sustainable development goals. in new zealand, we have sought to embed the principles behind the sdgs in a new living standards framework that is guiding policy making, and the management of our resources. and we remain committed to supporting the roll out of the sdgs alongside international partners through a significant increase in our official development assistance budget. universal values but revitalizing our international rules-based system isn't just about the mechanics of how we work together. it also means renewing our commitment to our values. the un charter recalls that the organization was formed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which through two world wars had brought untold sorrow to humanity. if we forget this history and the principles which drove the creation of the un we will be doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. in an increasingly uncertain world it is more important than ever that we remember the core values on which the un was built. that all people are equal. that everyone is entitled to have their dignity and human rights respected. that we must strive to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. and we must consistently hold ourselves to account on each. amongst renewing this commitment though, we have to acknowledge where accountability must continue - and that is especially the case when it comes to equality. so many gains have been made, each worthy of celebration. in new zealand we have just marked the 125 year since women were granted the right to vote. we were the first in the world to do so. as a girl i never ever grew up believing that my gender would stand in the way of me achieving whatever i wanted to in life. i am, after all, not the first, but the third female prime minister of new zealand. but for all of that, we still have a gender pay gap, an over representation of women in low paid work, and domestic violence. and we are not alone. it seems surprising that in this modern age we have to recommit ourselves to gender equality, but we do. and ifor one will never celebrate the gains we have made for women domestically. while internationally other women and girls experience a lack of the most basic of opportunity and dignity. we are all in this together. conclusion i accept that the list of demands on all of us is long. be it domestic, or international, we are operating in challengingtimes. we face what we call in new zealand 'wicked problems'. ones that are intertwined and interrelated. perhaps then it is time to step back from the chaos and ask what we want. it is in that space that we'll find simplicity. the simplicity of peace, of prosperity, of fairness. if i could distill it down into one concept that we are pursuing in new zealand it is simple and it is this. kindness. in the face of isolationism, protectionism, racism - the simple concept of looking outwardly and beyond ourselves, of kindness and collectivism, might just be as good a starting point as any. so let's start here with the institutions that have served us well in times of need, and will do so again. in the meantime, i can assure all of you. new zealand remains committed to continue to do our part to building and sustaining international peace and security. to promoting and defending an open, inclusive, and rules-based international order based on universal values. to being pragmatic, empathetic, strong and kind. the next generation after all, deserves no less. tena koutou, tena koutou, tena tatou katoa.","jacinda ardern, prime minster of new zealand, said that new zealanders’ empathy and strong sense of justice is matched by their pragmatism. regardless of its geographic isolation, new zealand sees itself as a member of the international community, a community whose heart is in the united nations. she urged that the organization’s founding principles not be consigned to the history books, noting that the need for multilateralism and collective action has never been greater. states are united by the positive and negative effects of globalization, and amid unprecedented economic growth there still exists a growing sense of insecurity. it is not surprising to witness a global trend of young people showing dissatisfaction with political systems, she noted. the world now has a generation that will grow up more connected than ever and unsure if jobs they are training for will exist in 20 years. this is a borderless generation, one that is calling for responses to challenges such as climate change. two weeks ago, at the pacific islands forum, climate change was declared the single biggest threat to security in the pacific. while action on climate change remains optional, the impact of inaction is not. any disintegration of multilateralism on the matter is catastrophic. she also stressed that while international institutions are not perfect, they can be fixed, calling on states to rebuild and recommit to multilateralism. there is a need to rediscover the shared belief in the value of connectedness. international trade, for instance, is helping millions out of poverty while at the same time some see their standard of living sliding. the answer to the problem is not protectionism, she assured, urging states to ensure that the benefits of trade be distributed fairly across societies. it is incumbent on states to build productive, sustainable and inclusive economies. new zealand has set itself the ambitious goal of becoming the best place in the world to be a child, she said, adding that focus on nurturing the next generation must be matched with concern over the environment it is inheriting. the maori community in new zealand encapsulates this concern through the belief that people are entrusted with the environment and thus have a duty to protect it. the race for economic growth and wealth will make all people poorer if it comes at the cost of the environment. meeting these challenges calls for united nations reform, she said, expressing support for the secretary‑general’s efforts aimed at making the organization more responsive and effective. it is up to member states to drive this change. in an increasingly uncertain world, it is more important than ever to remember the core values of the united nations, she emphasized, voicing her surprise at the need to have to recommit to gender equality. she said she will never celebrate the gains made by women in new zealand while internationally other women and girls experience a lack of the most basic of opportunities and dignity; “me too” must become “we too”, she stressed. states face a long list of demands, and in the face of isolation, protectionism and racism they must look outward in the spirit of kindness and collectivism. new zealand remains committed to do its part to build and sustain international peace and security and to defend an open, inclusive and rules‑based international order based on universal values."
Nicaragua,"statement by h.e. mr. denis moncada colindres minister of foreign affairs of the republic of nicaragua at the 73rd session of the general assembly october 1, 2018 unofficial translation his excellency, antonio guterres, secretary general of the united nations her excellency, maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the general assembly. ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the member states. ladies and gentlemen delegates, receive the message of peace from the people of nicaragua and from presidentcomandante daniel ortega and vice-president rosario murillo. 1. three years after the adoption of the 2030 agenda, we continue to witness a world in crisis originated by savage capitalism, by interference and violations of international law and the sovereignty of our peoples, with the use of force, attempts of coups d'etat and destabilizations that threaten the achievement of the sustainable development goals proposed in the 2030 agenda. 2. nicaragua has resisted the attempts of a coup d'etat; our country has once again won peace, fraternal coexistence and the progressive return of normal daily life. 3. the attempted coup d'etat that we have conquered in nicaragua is the result of this interventionism and has left us with serious damage and sequels, such as economic damage, death, destruction, and terrorism. 4. terrorism disguised as peaceful protest, atrociously killing citizens, policemen, setting on fire public and private property, assaults, violations, extortion, torture, and cruel inhumane degrading treatment. 5. in the region, nicaragua has a high recognition as a factor of regional stability, peace and security with important positive indicators in economic, political, social development, poverty reduction, gender equity and citizen security, being a barrier against inte ational organized crime, maras and gangs, terrorism and narcoactivity, all state policies that we continue to develop. 6. we assure and reiterate that in nicaragua we love peace, we strengthen security, and we promote and defend human rights in an integral way. 7. the government and the nicaraguan people defend the principle of independence and sovereignty, as established by the charter of the united nations, therefore, we demand and require the cessation of any interventionist policy that violates international law, with interventionist actions in nicaragua and against the brother peoples of our america and the world. 8. the government and the people of nicaragua have worked in a sustained manner to meet the objectives of agenda 2030. until april of this year our country was experiencing sustained and approximate economic growth of 4.7% per year. our projects and socialeconomic programs to eradicate general poverty at the national level, managed to reduce it from 42.5% in 2009, to 24.9% in 2016. 9. extreme poverty went from 14.6% in 2009, to 6.9% in 2016. 1 10. today we are once again facing the threat of the united states to curb the social, economic and cultural development of our people. we denounce these interventionism threats as they have introduced a bill in their congress that orders the inte ational financial organizations to oppose the granting of loans to nicaragua. 11. for nicaragua, to contribute to inte ational peace is to achieve general and complete nuclear disarmament, that is why we have signed and ratified the first treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, we call on other countries to ratify this historic treaty. 12. the government of the republic of nicaragua has supported the denuclearization of the korean peninsula through dialog and communication between the authorities on both sides. we welcome the rapprochement between the two koreas and the realization of the third inter-korean summit as well as the joint declaration of september in pyongyang that the two korean leaders agreed on and that is seen as a breakthrough to alleviate the tension of the peninsula and the substantial elimination of the danger of war in the whole peninsula. 13. the government of the republic of nicaragua hopes that nuclear weapons will be dismantled in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner and that the countries involved will cooperate and, in this way, ensure firm and lasting peace on the korean peninsula. 14. the government of nicaragua supports the nuclear negotiations between the islamic republic of iran and e3 / eu + 3, which resulted in the completion of the joint action plan (jcpoa) on july 14, 2015. we emphasize that this agreement demonstrates that dialog and diplomacy are the most appropriate means of solving these problems, as an essential part of making multilateralism work. 15. nicaragua condemns the criminal blockade against our sister republic of cuba and all its extraterritorial measures and ramifications. nicaragua rejects any coercive economic measure to try to bend the will and spirit of freedom and sovereignty of peoples and governments. it is unacceptable for our country the use unilateral coercive economic measures as a selecti e political instrument to illegally change governments. this year we will once again vote against the unjust blockade. 16. our sister bolivarian republic of venezuela, its bolivarian people and the legitimate government of president nicolas maduro, have all our solidarity and we have condemned the assassination attempt against president nicolas maduro and the threat of military intervention against the people and the bolivarian republic of venezuela. 17. it is necessary to continue supporting decolonization in the world, supporting the palestinian, saharawi, puerto rican and the falkland islands of argentina. 18. nicaragua advocates for the conformation of the two states, the state of israel and the state of palestine, with east jerusalem as its capital, according to the 1967 borders, living in peace and harmony. 19. we reiterate our total solidarity with the government and people of syria in their fight against international terrorism and in the defense of their sovereignty and territorial integrity. 20. humanity continues clamoring for peace, even after 73 years, our organization has not managed to fully comply with the objectives set in relation to peace. given this lamentable situation, the call for ""reinvention"" of the un, is urgent, as proposed by the nicaraguan 2 priest and foreign minister, miguel d'escoto during his presidency in this general assembly. to achieve this, we must promote the indispensable transformation, in order for this organization to serves the interests of all its members and the whole of humanity. 21. we wish to emphasize that during the presidency of this assembly, in 2008, father miguel d'escoto (rip), whom we rightfully call the chancellor of dignity of nicaragua, developed and fought until the end, precisely with these ideas, fulfilling the mandate of nicaragua to lay the foundations for the discussion of these transformations, with its proposal document: the reinvention of the united nations. 22. we need urgent actions to combat climate change. 23. the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities remains in force and the big emitters and those responsible for depredation, degradation, and imbalances in nature must recognize our losses and damages and contribute with the recovery to the life of mother earth and of the peoples of the world. 24. to achieve the sustainable development goals we need to repeal the unilateral coercive measures that are in violation of international law and that impede the development plans of our countries. 25. we must work for justice, peace, respect, dialog, sovereign security, in the world. to do this, we must promote the indispensable transformations, so that this organization serves the interests of all its members. 26. our government and our people advocates a world with values, where human beings can count on the best of ourselves, to foster the best possible conditions for fair, sustainable, equitable, secure and sovereign development, in which the advances of science and technology, reflected in all areas of our lives, are accessible and shared by all. 27. once again, our greetings and the hope of the nicaraguan people, that in this 73rd session, the commitment that we assume will result in an open and profound process of reflection, towards compulsory transformation, for the reinvention and democratization of the united nations. madam president, 28. to conclude, we affirm the commitment to continue fighting for peace, which is the priority that the world has, that our people have, and that the conflicts that arise in different regions of our planet can be overcome, through dialog, through negotiation and above all, fiee from the use or threat of the use of force, which is what most of our peoples long for, from the peoples of the great powers, to the small states in population, small in development, but great in their values and in their history. thank you so much. 3","denis ronaldo moncada colindres, minister for foreign affairs of nicaragua, said that three years after the adoption of the 2030 agenda, the world is witnessing a crisis caused by savage capitalism, interference and violations of international law. his government resisted an attempted coup d’état and is fostering peace and fraternal coexistence. comparing the coup’s attempt to interventionism, he said that terrorist activity in the country was conducted under the guise of peaceful protests. nicaragua stands for stability, peace and security in the region and is characterized by positive economic, political and social indicators. he reiterated that nicaragua loves peace and promotes and defends human rights. nicaragua and its people defend the principles of independence and sovereignty, as established by the united nations charter, he continued, demanding the cessation of any interventionist policy that violates international law. the government is working in a sustained manner to achieve the goals of the 2030 agenda and the country is experiencing economic growth. in addition, the national poverty rate decreased from 42.5 per cent in 2009 to 24.9 per cent in 2016, he pointed out, warning of efforts by the united states to curb social, economic and social development in nicaragua. he denounced that country’s move to introduce legislation that will order international financial organizations to oppose the granting of loans to nicaragua. international peace requires complete nuclear disarmament, he underscored, voicing his support for the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and adding his hope that nuclear weapons will be dismantled in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner with the international community contributing to lasting peace in the region. nicaragua also supports nuclear negotiations with iran and the joint comprehensive plan of action; that agreement demonstrates that dialog and diplomacy are the best means to solve such problems. he also condemned the blockade imposed on cuba and assassination attempts against the president of venezuela. noting the importance of supporting decolonization, he voiced his support for a two‑state solution to the israeli‑palestinian conflict and for the government of syria in its fight against terrorism. calling for the reinvention of the united nations, he said that process will transform the organization into one that serves the interests of all its members. furthermore, urgent action is needed to combat climate change. in that regard, the principle of common but differentiated responsibility remains in force. major greenhouse gas emitters must contribute to the recovery of the planet. achieving the sustainable development goals calls for the rejection of unilateral coercive measures that impede development. the international community must work for peace, respect, dialog and sovereignty as part of a united nations transformation process. affirming nicaragua’s commitment to fight for peace, he asserted that conflict can be overcome through dialog."
Niger,,"kalla ankourao, minister for foreign affairs of niger, reaffirmed niger’s support of the secretary-general reforms and welcomed the theme of this year’s general assembly as a reminder of the united nations founding ideals. the problems facing the world require greater global collaboration, he said, also welcoming the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. combating irregular migration and illegal trafficking has been at the heart of numerous meetings; now the focus must be to implement those commitments. to that end, niger had designed a doctrine that would enable it to achieve significant results and it has already seen a reduction in migrants over the past year, he said, also advocating for humane treatment of migrants. niger will attend the international conference in marrakesh this december and will support the adoption of the migration compact. the sustainable development goals are of particular interest to developing countries and offer an excellent opportunity for niger to share the progress it has made in areas like education, health and security issues, he said. as part of development efforts, niger has developed a strategy for inclusive growth that also takes into account the african union’s 2063 agenda. he supported the establishment of the african continental free trade area, which seeks to help countries overcome dependence on the export of basic products and find social and economic transformation for inclusive growth and sustainable development. efforts to mobilize domestic resources have been made but challenges remain. niger is a country that is two-thirds desert and feels the full brunt of climate change, a phenomenon that has a significant effect on its economy. the paris agreement on climate change must be implemented, and niger will host a round table on technical and financial partnerships that will define ways to implement the agreement in the region. additional financing will allow countries in his region to better handle climate change, he stressed. in response to niger’s rapidly growing population, the government bolstered up efforts to reverse the trend, and indeed, the birth rate shrank from 7.6 births per woman in 2012 to 6 in 2017, he said. if that trend continues, niger would, within a few years, achieve demographic growth in line with the country’s gdp, but will need assistance with certain social programs to achieve that goal, like ensuring girls stay in school until age 16. regarding the situation in the lake chad basin, the deployment of troops had weakened the operational capabilities of boko haram there. now the challenges are more socioeconomic than security related, he said. on the g-5 sahel joint force, he said that thanks to the brussels conference earlier this year, the force’s financing needs for the first year have been met. yet prospects are not reassuring to guarantee the requisite financing for the force to complete its mission, he said, asking that the force’s mandate be placed under chapter vii of the charter. he welcomed peaceful developments in other parts of africa, including the horn of africa and in south sudan, but said that international solidarity for the palestinians has taken a step back this year and reaffirmed niger’s support for their cause. regarding security council reform, he encouraged member states to speed up the process to adapt the security council to reflect today’s world. new forms of conflict lead to asymmetrical war, he said, calling to strengthen peacekeeping missions."
Nigeria,"r statement delivered his excellency, muhammadu buhari, president of federal republic of nigeria the general debate of the 73^0 session of united nations general assembly in new york, 25™ september,2018 madam president, fellow heads of state and government, mr. secretary-general, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the government and people of nigeria, i congratulate you, madam president, on your well-deserved election as president of the 73rd general assembly. as you embark on your assignment, i would like to assure you of nigeria's support in no less measure than that which we extended to your illustrious predecessor. his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak. 2. we appreciate the effective leadership he gave the 72""^ assembly with such dedication, commitment,and fairness to all member states. i also salute our distinguished secretary-general, h.e. mr. antonio guterres, who steered the affairs of the secretariat with focused commitment to the collective united nations pursuit of global peace and security, equity and justice,inclusiveness, women's empowerment and human rights. page 2 of 13 3- it is appropriate at this point to remember with deep sadness our late 7* secretary- general mr. kofi annan who passed away on the eve of his 82*""^ birthday. kofi's significant contributions to the work of our organization have been acknowledged in the well deserved tributes that poured in from around the world following his death. 4. we in africa, while mourning the loss of this great son of ours and citizen of the world, take pride in the way he served humanity in a truly exemplary manner. he demonstrated, in his calm but determined manner, the virtues of compassion, dedication to the cause ofjustice, fairness and human rights. he was a visionary leader who inspired hope even in the face of the most daunting challenges. he devoted his entire life's career to the un and the pursuit ofits ideals and goals. the world is indeed a better place thanks to his exemplary service. page 3 of 13 madam president, 5. during the past year, the world saw some positive results and encouraging signs from the bilateral and multilateral efforts of the international community to address conflicts, crises and threats to world peace. we particularly commend the efforts ofthe leaders ofthe united states, north korea,and south korea,to realize our shared goal of a nuclear free korean peninsula. 6. in this connection, we acloiowledge the commitment to peace shown by president donald trump and chairman kim jong-un by initiating a historic summit. we urge that they continue this positive engagement. 7. regrettably, many ofthe crises and threats to peace and security around the world which we debated last year as we did over several previous years remain unresolved. in some cases, matters got worse. the continuing plight of the rohingyas in myanmar, the protracted israeli/palestinian conflict, the wars in yemen,and syria, and the fight against international and local terrorism such as boko haram and alshabaab come to mind. page 4 of 13 8. the terrorist insurgencies we face, particularly in the sahel and the lake chad basin, are partly fuelled by local factors and dynamics, but now increasingly by the international jihadi movement, runaway fighters from iraq and syria and arms from the disintegration oflibya. 9. in myanmar, the carnage appears to have thanlcfiilly abated somewhat. we commend the united nations for staying focussed on the situation ofthe rohingya people,to bring their suffering to an end, and hold to account the perpetrators of the atrocious crimes committed against innocent and vulnerable members of this community, including women,children and the old. 10. the international community should strengthen its resolve to combat ethnic and religious cleansing everywhere. we support the un's efforts in ensuring that the rohingya refugees are allowed to return to their homes in myanmar with security, protection, and guarantee of citizenship. we note the indication by the government of myanmar ofits willingness to address these issues and we encourage them to do so expeditiously. page 5 of 13 11. in this context, nigeria commends the government and people of bangladesh in particular and all other countries and organizations that have contributed to shouldering the burden of providing shelter and other vital assistance to the rohingya refugees. 12. the carnage and the worsening humanitarian situations in syria and yemen continue unabated. but the international community cannot afford to give up on the syrian and yemeni people. we must pursue all efforts to find peaceful negotiated political solutions to these wars which cannot be won by force of arms alone. regarding syria, we hope that the un sponsored geneva process and the sochi initiative, led by russia, iran, and turkey advance this objective. 13. the international community must keep up the pressure to encourage the parties to pursue the path of dialog, negotiations and inclusiveness in resolving their sectarian divides and bringing to an end the immense human suffering in syria as well as yemen. we commend turkey, jordan, greece, germany, italy and france for hosting the millions ofthe refugees fleeing these brutal conflicts. page 6 of 13 14- the situation in the middle east, grave as it has always been, is now worsened by developments since our last meeting. nigeria continues to call on the israelis and the palestinians to make the necessary compromises in the interest of justice, peace and security, in line with our numerous un resolutions and applicable international laws. 15. unilateral, arbitrary and insensitive actions only prolong the conflict and undermine world peace and security. the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza is an appalling result of unrestrained use of power. we urge both parties to re-engage in dialog on the basis of relevant un resolutions, the madrid principles, the quartet roadmap and the arab peace initiative, among others. 16. nigeria reaffirms its unwavering support for a just two-state solution, negotiated without intimidation and with israel and palestine existing side-by-side in peace and security. 17. the crises in the middle east have deep roots and have remained unresolved for too long. yet, we should not fall into self-defeating despair and conclude that they are not amenable to solution. page 7 of 13 18. we should draw inspiration from the remarkable leadership that got ethiopia and eritrea to restore long-lost hope for peace between them, a remarkable show of statesmanship which has now galvanized neighboring countries, including djibouti and somalia to push for peace in the sub-region. i believe that with hard work, commitment, and a disposition to compromise and necessary sacrifices, peace is achievable in the middle east as well. 19. most crises usually have a variety offestering causes and effects. it is the failure to address them early and effectively that lead to out- of- control conflicts. addressing them includes national and international collective actions which positively impact on peoples and communities. hence,'making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies' which is the theme for this year's general assembly, is very apt indeed. page 8 of 13 madam president, 20. a topical consequence of the current conflicts around the world is the irregular migration of affected people from the middle east, afghanistan, and africa to europe. irregular migration entails huge avoidable loss ofhuman lives, puts strains on services in host countries and communities, and fuels anti- immigrant and racist sentiments in europe. that is why we welcome the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the first-ever global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and we look forward to its adoption in marrakech later this year. the aim is to protect the rights of migrants worldwide, while addressing the concerns of countries of 'origin, 'transit', or 'destination' alike. 21. migration is a constant in human affairs. we in africa are grateful to countries who treat migrants with compassion and humanitynotably germany, italy and france. 22. irregular migration is not a consequence of conflicts alone, but of the effects of climate change and lack of opportunities at home. climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. very close to us at home, it is our lot in nigeria, together with our neighbors around the chad basin, to live with the climate change page 9 of 13 consequences of a drastically shrunk lake chad and the parching up of otherwise fertile arable lands. 23. the lake was a major source of livelihood to more than 45 million inhabitants of the region. its shrinking meant loss of livelihoods and they are now rendered poor and vulnerable to the activities ofextremists and terrorist groups. the instability thus caused in the sub-region intensified internal displacements leading, among other consequences, to intense economic competition especially between farmers and herdsmen. 24. this is why we continue to call for a rededicated international engagement to accelerate the recovery efforts in the lake chad basin to address the root causes of the conflicts in the region. what is required is continuous and robust un cooperation with national governments and sub-regional and regional organizations such as the lake chad basin commission, the economic community of west african states and the african union, to enhance capacity in conflict prevention, conflict management and peace building. page 10 of 13 25- with regard to the lake chad basin plight, i extend our heartfelt appreciation to the united nations, the governments of germany, norway, the united states, sweden, the united kingdom, france and a host of other development partners for their laudable support in assisting us to address both the humanitarian challenges and the on going stabilization drive in the region. madam president, 26. corruption within countries and illicit flow of funds across national boundaries have huge negative impact on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions in developing countries. corruption significantly deprives national governments of resources to provide meaningful livelihoods to their populations who are predominantly youths, thus giving rise to more irregular migration. 27. the fight against corruption,therefore,involves us all. it is in our collective interest to cooperate in tracking illicit financial flows, investigate and prosecute corrupt individuals and entities and repatriate such funds to their countries of origin. page 11 of 13 28. fighting corruption or resolving international conflicts, crises and wars; defeating terrorism and piracy; curbing arms trafficking and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons which fuel these conflicts, particularly in africa; stemming irregular migration by addressing its root causes; and the many other global challenges we are faced with today can only be effectively addressed through multilateral cooperation and concerted action. 29. the only global institutional framework we have to address these challenges is the united nations system. that is why we continue to call for the strengthening of the organization and making it more effective by speeding up the pace of progress towards its reform, including that of its principal organ, the security council. the reconstitution of the council to make it more equitable and more representative of our global community is both a political and moral imperative. 30. we believe that a reformed security council with expanded membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, is in accord with prevailing international consensus and it is in our collective interest to do so. it is high time we stop skirting round the issue and establish achievable benchmarks and time frames for these reforms. 31. i assure you all that in this advocacy, 1 am only reflecting nigeria's deep and abiding commitment to our organization and its founding principles and goals. from the date we joined in 1960, we have contributed our quota to the fulfillment ofthe mandate ofthe un. we have been active participants in many security council and african union authorized peace keeping operations around the world, beginning with the democratic republic of congo operations in i960. 32. furthermore, nigeria has always mobilized the required human and material resources to achieve set united nations goals, including the recently adopted 2030 agenda for sustainable development. we are resolute in complementing the efforts and examples of the united nations to promote gender equality and youth empowerment as necessary pillars for sustainable development. 33. without these, there can be neither enduring peace nor security. as we set and implement our national policies to achieve these goals, we, in the spirit of international solidarity, will readily cooperate with other nations seeking to achieve similar goals for their own populations to help ensure that no one is left behind. 34. 1 thank you all for your attention. page 13 of 13","muhammadu buhari, president of nigeria, said africans took pride in the way former united nations secretary-general kofi annan served humanity in an exemplary manner. the international community is witnessing positive results from bilateral and multilateral efforts to address conflicts and threats to world peace, he said, pointing to recent commitments by the united states and democratic people’s republic of korea. however, other crises have deteriorated. the international community must strengthen its resolve to combat ethnic and religious cleansing everywhere, including myanmar, he said, where rohingya refugees must be able to return to their homes with guarantees of security and citizenship. carnage in syria and yemen continues unabated and he called for negotiated political solutions to those crises. the situation in the middle east is worsening and the humanitarian crisis in gaza is the result of unrestrained use of power. he reaffirmed support for a just two-state solution to the israeli‑palestinian crisis. terrorist insurgencies continue to affect the sahel and lake chad regions, increasingly fuelled by the international jihadi movement. he said irregular migration entails avoidable loss of lives and strains all countries affected by migration flows. he welcomed the successful conclusion of negotiations on the first-ever global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and looked forward to its adoption later this year. climate change is contributing to irregular migration and negatively impacting the livelihood of those around the lake chad region, leading to instability in the subregion. turning to corruption, he noted that illicit flows of funds across borders negatively impact the stability, peace and economic prospects of millions of people in developing countries. corruption deprives governments of resources to provide meaningful livelihoods to their populations. it is in the collective interest of all states to cooperate in tracking illicit financial flows, and investigate and prosecute corrupt individuals. stressing that current challenges can only be addressed through multilateral cooperation and concerted action, he reiterated the call for strengthening the united nations and speeding reforms of the security council, with expanded membership in line with prevailing international consensus. nigeria is mobilizing the human and material resources to achieve united nations goals, including those outlined in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development."

() we must deal ith the challenges of globalization hile at the same time maximizing the benefits for our citizens. our job is to deliver security, jobs, education and healthcare. workin to ether has enabled all of us to do far more than we could have done alone. norway has taken national and international action. throu h our national policy to promote sustainable livelihoods. through our nordic and european partnerships on economic and civic inte ration. and throu h global action to promote peace and security, sound management of the oceans, fair and re ulated trade, education for all, and global health measures. together we have achieved impressive results. because international cooperation works. e treme povert has been halved, people live longer, child mortality rates are falling, and more irls attend school than ever before. global political cooperation, global trade, and international law have been crucial to this progress. president, we have to recognize that globalization has not been equally beneficial for all. this is a very real challenge. exclusion can spur radicalisation. it can undermine confidence in international institutions and cooperation. eventually it could weaken respect for international la , human rights and even our security architecture. to counter this, we must secure the future welfare of a rapidly growin population. this re uires both protection and reform of fundamental trade norms. we cannot afford to let protectionism, discrimination and economic rivalry define our future. the wto is essential for norway and our interaction with the world. i believe rules-based trade is just as important for our partners. free trade creates winners. protectionism does not. () in order to benefit all, rights, rules and responsibilities must be modernized to fit our current global economy. this is vital if we are to build a world where people s potential, creativity and ho es for the future can be realized through cooperation, e change of knowled e and trade. increased protectionism forces us to reflect on what less international cooperation would entail. president, as we agreed in 1945, all nations must unite in a commitment to maintain international peace and security. the consequences of instability affect us all. and global security threats require global responses. the security council must be able to act, and so must we - as nations and as re ional or anisations. areas of conflict and instability are breeding grounds for violent e tremism and international terrorism, the conflict in syria is but one e ample. many different actors are involved, both state and non-state. banned weapons of mass destruction have reappeared. humanitarian access is obstructed. respect for human rights and international law is undermined. on my own continent, europe, fundamental rules and principles of international law are now in jeopardy. ukraine’s soverei nty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders must be restored. violent extremism, conflict and instability lead to humanitarian crises and violations of human rights. these in turn are some of the main drivers of both regular and irregular migration.terrorism and violent extremism affect us all and are not limited to any single ideolo y, reli ion or belief. (chec against delivery) norway is standing up a ainst violent e tremism and terrorism. not in response to individual incidents, but as a lon -term foreign policy commitment. we are one of 79 members of the global coalition against isil by working to ether we have achieved si nificant results on the ground. still, in the continued fi ht a ainst violent extre ism, we must apply a whole-of-societ ap roach. we must address the root causes. in the middle east and else here, includin in our o n countries and continents. we must brin individual perpetrators to justice and prevent impunity. norway believes that those responsible for grave violations of international humanitarian law must be held accountable. we have, from the beginning, been a staunch supporter of the icc as an independent institution. at the same time, security is closely linked to sustainable development. we must boost trade and job creation. build capacity for generating domestic revenue. strengthen public service delivery. and combat corruption. corruption fuels inequafity, crime, instability and violence. president, conflict can reverse years of spcial and economic progress. conflict prevention, peacekeeping and disarmament are vital if we are to reach the sustainable development goals. we should heed the secretary-general s call for a sur e in peace diplomac . norway is doin its part. since the end of the cold war, conflict mediation and resolution has been a cornerstone of our forei n policy. (check against deli ery) for more than 25 years, we have been engaged in efforts to resolve conflicts around the world. from the first oslo accord in 1993, to on oing work in colombia and the philippines, and back to the middle east. we have learned an important lesson from our efforts: ne otiatin a peace a reement is always difficult; but implementin the agreement is even harder. the majority of conflicts recur. in fact conflict recurrence is more common than the onset of ne conflicts. this means that the best way to prevent conflict is to ensure that peace is sustainable. norway remains committed in colombia, the philippines and elsewhere, just as we remain committed to helping to achieve a negotiated two-state solution between the israelis and palestinians. president, the adoption of agenda 2030 with the 17 sustainable development goals demonstrated the uni ue value of the united nations. we have a reed on a universal development agenda - a roadmap to the world we want. the sdgs are closely interlinked. achievin oal 16 on peace, the rule of law and stron institutions is crucial for ensurin that funds are not lost to corruption. and achievin the sdgs related to economic conditions, will make f nding available that can be used to make progress on other goals. but we have no time to lose. sustainable chan e cannot be brou ht about overni ht. national ownership is critical, but civil society, the private sector, trade unions and the scientific community all have a catalytic role to play. (chech against delivery) president, health is an area where it is easy to see that the sdgs apply to us all. health is both a human ri ht in itself and a prerequisite for development investin in national health systems is expensive. but failing to do so can prove even more costly. the world health organization is working to create a lobal action plan for a simpler health architecture. this is a response to an initiative by ghana, germany and norway. the. action plan will be presented in berlin in october. prevention saves lives, reduces human sufferin and enhances economic and social development. norway is proud to be hostin the first replenishment conference of the global financin facility (gff) in oslo on 6 november, and will contribute substantially. president, progress on one sdg will stimulate pro ress on others. for example, child mortality rates fall when mothers have an education. however, there are still more bo s than irls who et an education. we have to put irls at the center of our education efforts. but just oing to school is not enough. this is why norway has focused on teachin quality and learnin outcomes. ensuring qualit education requires continued international financing, and the financing ap is considerable. it is therefore important to mobilize domestic resources and private funding alon side official development assistance. norway is doin its part. so far this year, we have allocated approximately 440 million dollars to lobal education. and we will now increase our support to education efforts targeting irls to nearly 40 million dollars for the period 2018 to 2019. (check against deliuery) president, clean and healthy oceans that are sustainably harvested are a prere uisite for reaching the sdgs. 50 % of the world s oxy en comes from the oceans. and 30 % of the world s c02 emissions are absorbed by the oceans. our oceans offer us enormous renewable resources. a source of great promise and economic potential. almost half of the world's population already depends on the oceans for nutrition and employment. but in order to ensure a sustainable ocean economy, we must produce more from the oceans. however, the sustainability of our oceans is threatened. by 2050 they could contain more plastic than fish. marine litter is one of the fastest rowin en ironmental concerns. since i started speakin , a further 200 tons of plastic will have ended up in the sea. the un environment assembly has taken a bold step and adopted a vision of zero discharge of plastic litter into the ocean. now e must translate this into action. mana in our oceans sustainably is crucial. increased global funding is imperative. norway will di deep to contribute. we have no time to lose. this is why, earlier this week, i established the high-level panel for a sustainable ocean economy, made up of heads of state and government from all continents. we aim to promote science-based decision-makin in the fields of ocean economy and ocean mana ement. we ill cooperate closely with the un special envoy for the ocean and other ocean initiatives. we aim to present our report in 2020. (check against deiiuery) president, for seven decades, norway has been a consistent supporter of the united nations and a rules-based multilaterar order. we are one of the largest financial contributors to the un. we consistently allocate 1 % of our ross national income to development aid. there is broad support for the un and for our enga ement in sustainable development and peace across the political spectrum. in 2021 it will be 20 years since norway last had a seat on the security council. we are ready to serve again. if e are elected, we will work to make the security council more transparent, efficient and representative. we will work with other member states - re ardless of their size, wealth or eo raphical location - to find common solutions. we will draw on our experience of peace and reconciliation processes. as women s ri hts and participation are crucial for lasting peace and stabilit , we will keep this issue hi h on our agenda. to ether with partners from many re ions, norway will support initiatives for sustainable oceans and forests. we will hi hlight the consequences of climate change and the link between security and sustainable development. we will promote reform of the council to make it more transparent and representative and better equipped to deal with current lobal realities. norway will continue to be a consistent partner to the un. we will continue to seek common solutions to the challen es we face in our common future. () and we do of course ask for your support for our candidature. thank you. ()","erna solberg, prime minister of norway, said the job of saving future generations from the scourge of war, which the united nations set out to fulfill, has not been done. as the 17 sustainable development goals recognize that global and national challenges are interlinked, it is clear that “we can achieve more when we act together”, she said, highlighting gains made in halving extreme poverty levels and reaching other development benchmarks. however, globalization has not been equally beneficial for all and efforts must made to reform trade norms and to modernize rights, rules and responsibilities to fit the current global economy, she said, adding that free trade promotes winners, while protectionism does not. turning to security concerns, she raised alarm at the syrian conflict. emphasizing that the security council must be able to act, she pointed out that banned weapons have reappeared and respect for human rights and international law has been undermined. rules and principles are in jeopardy in europe, as ukraine’s recognized borders must be restored. moreover, violent extremism, conflict and instability are driving crises that affect all nations. norway supports the international criminal court as an independent institution and believes that security is closely linked with sustainable development. in that vein, she recommended boosting trade and job creation while building capacity for generating domestic revenue and strengthening public service delivery. conflict can reverse years of social and economic progress, so prevention, peacekeeping and disarmament are vital if the world intends to achieve the sustainable development goals. on the 2030 agenda, the goals are linked. for instance, achieving economic goals will make funding available to foster further progress on other objectives. “but, we have no time to lose,” she said. “sustainable change cannot be brought about overnight. national ownership is critical, but civil society, the private sector, trade unions and the scientific community all have a catalytic role to play.” for its part, norway has played an active role in promoting many of the 2030 agenda goals and targets, she said, providing a list of examples, from funding education initiatives to establishing the high-level panel for a sustainable ocean economy, aimed at promoting science-based decision-making in the fields of ocean economy and management. as a strong supporter of the united nations, she said, norway is a large financial contributor and works with partners from many regions on promoting sustainable development. norway also promotes security council reform with a view to making it more transparent and representative, she said, noting that her country will continue to seek common solutions to challenges faced by all."
Oman,"statement by h.e mr. yousef bin alawi bin abdullah minister responsible for foreign affairs united nations general assembly session new york 29 september 2018 nations permanent mission of the sultanate ofoman to the united nations 5 dag i-hwunarskjdld plaza 305fmsi 47"" slreei. 12""'floor. .\'e^v york. ny 10017 tel: (212) 355-3505 fax: (212) 644-0070 madame president, at the outset, i would like to extend the warmest congratulations to you and your friendly nation, on your election as president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly, and i assure you the support of the permanent mission of the sultanate of oman to your excellency's efforts in order to ensure the success of the current session. we are also pleased to express our appreciation to your predecessor, h. e. mr. miroslav lajcak, for the manner in which he steered the work of the previous session, and for the decisions that were taken during his tenure. i also would like to seize this opportunity to commend the efforts exerted by the secretary-general of the united nations, h. e. mr. antonio guterres in strengthening the role of the organization and developing its mechanisms, so as to achieve the goals, principles and charter of the united nations. madame president, the work of the united nations must foeus on facing challenges, settling international disputes and conflicts, achieving peace. hence, in the spirit of my country's firm believe that dialog and negotiation are the most convenient means of resolving difference; we confirm that the sultanate of oman will spare no effort in supporting the initiatives that will achieve peace, spread security and stability in the middle east and the world. we consider that peace is a central building block for stability and development. as such, we hope that member countries shall cooperate within new perspectives that are consistent with the principles of goodneighborliness, respect for the national sovereignty, and non intervention in the internal affairs of other states. madame president, the palestinian cause is the central problem for the middle east. therefore, the cooperation of the international community in creating a suitable environment to help the parties involved end the conflict is considered, as a matter of particular strategic urgency. we think that despite the difficult current situation and the stalemate in dialog, however, it is convenient to create favorable conditions for positive discussions between the palestinian and israeli parties, to reach a comprehensive settlement, based on the two-state solution, since not establishing a palestinian state will perpetuate violence and terrorism. we, in the sultanate of oman, are willing to make every effort in our disposal to restore the optimistic environment, in order to reach a comprehensive agreement, taking into account, the future of peaceful co existence in the middle east, particularly between palestinian and israeli generations. for, achieving a peaceful environment between the palestinian and israeli parties is essential to establish peace in the region. we also call upon countries of the world, particularly, the united states, which has an essential role in achieving peace and stability in the world, to consider the future of this cause from the perspective of supporting orientations in peace, facilitating the work of international organizations, and not sacrificing peace. madame president, the suffering of the republic of yemen, manifested in a tragic humanitarian and economic situation due to the collapse of infrastructure in health, education, and other crucial services that affect the daily life of citizens, as well as the spread of diseases and inadequate medical treatment and medicines, requires all of us to double our efforts to help yemen. the international community has to adopt a humanitarian project that would enable access to humanitarian aid by the yemeni people in different provinces, and facilitating the use of airports and ports for that end, because the dire humanitarian situation requires taking such measures. in this context, my country welcomes the efforts pursued by the united nations and the countries of the coalition to establish a humanitarian medical airlift to patients with critical conditions, so that they receive medical treatment via scheduled flights, under the auspices of the united nations and in collaboration with the yemeni parties. also, my country supports the efforts of the special envoy to yemen, martin griffins and calls on facilitating his mission in holding meetings and consultations with all yemeni parties, and facilitating their transportation to participate in such meetings. we envision that the political solution should take into account, the yemeni reality, and that all yemeni parties and political forces, in yemen and abroad, should be given a chance in determining a prosperous future of their country. i would like to confirm that the facilities and humanitarian assistance provided by the sultanate of oman to the brotherly yemeni people is continuing, and that the land, sea and air entry/exit points, between the sultanate of oman and yemen, which is the only available means for the brotherly yemenis to cross and interact with the outside world, shall remain open on grounds of brotherly and neighborly considerations, deep historical and social ties between the omani and yemeni peoples, and for the impact of humanitarian suffering of yemenis on us. as far as the syrian crisis is concerned, violence is receding apparently in several syrian areas, due the effort led by the russian federation, the syrian government, the united states, and the european union and regional countries, through the plan to reduce violence and tensions. undoubtedly, the collaborative effort had a significant role in combating terrorism; and we hope that such efforts and joint cooperation continues in syria and other conflict areas. we also laud the efforts achieved by the special envoy to syria, staffan de mistura in helping the syrian parties develop the constitutional foundation, and build on what has been accomplished in geneva, astana and sochi to stop the war and reach a national reconciliation that ends the conflict. madame president, my country would like to welcome the positive developments in the african horn region and the understandings reached by states in the region, which will result in restoring confidence and ending differences. we welcome the efforts led by the ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed and the pivotal role played by his country, which shall translate into achieving security and stability in the african horn. in conclusion, my country renews its call upon all countries of the world to adhere to the principles of united nations and international law, and resolve differences in peaceful means, without resorting to wars, and consequently, their tragic fallouts, so that there would be security, stability, development and prosperity for the peoples of the world. thank you.","yousuf bin alawi bin abdallah, minister for foreign affairs of oman, said that the work of the united nations must focus on settling international disputes and achieving peace. underscoring that dialog and negotiations are the most convenient means for resolving differences, he stressed that his country will spare no effort to support the initiatives that will spread peace and stability in the middle east and the world. peace is a central building block for development, and the palestinian question is the central problem for the middle east, he went on to say. the cooperation of the international community in creating a conducive environment to help the parties involved resolve the conflict is a matter of strategic urgency. despite the stalemate in the process, it is important to create favorable conditions for the two parties to reach a settlement based on the two‑state solution. if the palestinian state is not established there will be no end to the cycle of violence. he called on the countries of the world, particularly the united states, to consider the future of this cause. the suffering of yemen is due to the collapse of the infrastructure including health, education and other crucial services that affect the day‑to‑day life of citizens, he continued. the international community must double its efforts to help that country, he said, welcoming efforts by the united nations and the countries of the arab coalition to establish a humanitarian medical airlift for patients with critical conditions to receive proper medical treatment under the auspices of the united nations. he also voiced support for the efforts of the special envoy to yemen. the political solution should take into account the reality in yemen and all parties should be given a chance to fulfill a prosperous future for their country. he lauded the efforts of the special envoy to syria to help parties build on efforts to stop the war and reach a reconciliation that ends the conflict. he also welcomed the positive developments in the african horn region and the understanding reached by states in the region, and expressed support for the efforts of the ethiopian prime minister and the pivotal role played by his country that contribute to achieving stability in the african horn. he renewed his country’s call to all countries of the world to adhere to the principles of the united nations charter and to resolve differences through peaceful means."
Pakistan,"pakistan permanent mission to the united nations 8 east 65th street - new york, ny 10065 - (212) 879-8600 statement by h.e. makhdoom shah mahmood qureshi foreign minister of the islamic republic of pakistan at the 73 rd session of the united nations general assembly new york, 29 th september 2018 1 statement by foreign minister makhdoom shah mahmood qureshi at the general debate of the 73 rd session of the un general assembly (new york, 29 september 2018) madam president, excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, may i begin by felicitating madam maria fernanda espinosa graces upon her election as president of the general assembly. the stewardship of this session by an accomplished leader of her ranking and stature, would undoubtedly lend to the proceedings of this assembly greater credence and strength. i also commend miroslav lackjack for his able guidance of the previous session. we appreciate secretary general antonio gutteres for his exemplary leadership of the organization, and support his efforts to instill a new sense of mission and direction in the united nations. our profound condolences over the passing away of former secretary general kofi anan, who was a leading light and a driving force in taking the un agenda forward into the twenty first century. we expressed deep sympathy and condolences to the government and people of indonesia for the damage caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. madam president, two months ago, the people of pakistan voted for change, for reform and for a fundamental shift in their paradigm of governance. they opted for a pakistan, confident and compassionate, open and articulate, peaceful and principled. 2 a pakistan that will engage with its neighborhood and the world on the basis of equality and respect; a country that will seek resolution of conflicts and convergence of interests; and a state that will build upon common understandings, reciprocal commitments and shared ideals. pakistan will brook no compromise on the interests of the nation, the sovereignty of the state, or the security of its people. our government is keen to pursue a policy of partnerships for peace, security and prosperity in our immediate neighborhood and beyond. we seek a peaceful environment to promote our development agenda both at the national level and in our region. madam president, i stand before this assembly as the representative of a quintessential developing country, that has at its heart, the welfare of its people. under the leadership of prime minister imran khan, we have begun giving shape to the vision of a new pakistan through a set of integrated policies and programs. madam president, the world faces a moment of inflection. the very foundations, the very principles on which the edifice of global order is constructed are under assault. inequality within and among nations is on the rise. forces of protectionism, populism and isolationism are gaining currency. intolerance is ascendant over acceptance; rhetoric over reason, and power over principle where the world needs bridges, we see fortifications; where it needs highways, we see blockades, and where it yearns freedom, we see cages. new forms and manifestations of imperialism are appearing. multilateralism is on a path of retreat. unilateralist tendencies are growing. long standing legal norms are being eroded for strategic and commercial considerations. 3 dark clouds of trade wars are looming large on the horizon. challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, pandemics, transnational organized crime and sustainable development are becoming ever more complex. the post-world war idealism is giving way, slowly but surely, to a hardened, militaristic approach. this trend, madam president, is not only regressive, it is downright dangerous. madam president, we note with concern seismic shifts in the geopolitical landscape of the middle east. as existing conflicts exacerbate, new threats have emerged. competing interests of regional and extra regional powers are deepening long standing fissures, and widening the fault lines, even as the tragedy of palestine continues to fester. in these uncertain times, the global community appears to be in desperate quest for leadership, a vision, and an order. madam presiden t, consider the issue of striking the right balance between freedom of expression and sentiments of a people. where there ought to be empathy, understanding and compassion, we see caricatured, ill informed, jaundiced judgments. recently, muslims across the world, were pained at a planned competition of cartoons of our holy prophet (peace be upon him). this deeply hurt muslim sentiments and sensibilities on its part, pakistan will continue to collaborate with friends and partners, on the un and orc platforms to reverse the growing tide of bigotry, build cross­ cultural understandings, and promote dialog amongst civilizations. madam president, the theme of this year's general assembly session is not only apt but also mirrors the priorities of my government. 4 as we embark upon our journey of change and reform, pakistan stands ready to strengthen its partnership with the un family of institutions. alongside like-minded states, we will continue madam president, to be a leading voice for comprehensive reform of the un security council, to make it more democratic, representative, transparent and effective. we will continue to oppose the creation of new centers of privilege and prestige, in defiance of principles of democracy, and the charter's core tenet of sovereign equality of member states. madam president, since its inception, pakistan has been an ardent adherent of the un charter, and an active participant in the un processes. pakistan has served seven terms on the un security council, five presidencies of the economic and social councils, and four terms at the human rights council. this is reaffirmation of faith of the international community in pakistan. we have championed the cause of the peoples of africa and asia to exercise their inalienable right of self-determination and wrest independence from the yoke of colonial rule. as we pay tribute to the memory of nelson mandela madiba, we are reminded of the high ideals he sacrificed so much for. the best way to honor the legacy of this great leader is to continue to fight the good fight, for freedom, for dignity and for equality. madam president, pakistan remains one of the oldest, largest and most active contributors to un peacekeeping operations the world over. the pakistani blue helmets have laid lives in the cause of global peace. we are proud of their sacrifices. pakistan remains also host to one of the oldest peace keeping missions, the un military observer group in india and pakistan (unmogip). we greatly value unmogip's contribution in monitoring ceasefire along the line of control in jammu & kashmir. 5 madam president, pakistan desires a relationship with india based on sovereign equality and mutual respect. we seek resolution of disputes through a serious and comprehensive dialog that covers all issues of concern. we were to meet on the sidelines of this unga session to talk about all issues with india- india called off dialog the third time for the modi government - each time on flimsy grounds. they preferred politics over peace. they used the pretext of stamps issued months ago, of a kashmiri activist and depicting grave human rights violations, including pellet gun victims, as an excuse to back out from the talks. dialog is the only way to address long standing issues that have long bedeviled south asia, and prevented the region from realizing its true potential. the unresolved jammu and kashmir dispute hinders the realization of the goal of durable peace between our two countries. for over seventy years now, it has remained on the agenda of the un security council and a blot on the conscience of humanity. for seventy years the people of occupied jammu & kashmir have struggled for their rights of self-determination in the face of overwhelming oppression and gross violations of their fundamental human rights by the indian occupation forces. there can be no lasting peace in south asia without a just settlement of the kashmir dispute based on the un security council resolutions and the will of the kashmiri people. pakistan welcomes the recently released report by the office of the un high commissioner for human rights. the report rightly lifts the veil from decades of obfuscation and chronicles the massive ongoing violations of human rights in indian occupied kashmir. it vindicates our position. no longer the excuse of terrorism can be used to continue to systematically oppress the kashmiri people. pakistan endorses the un report and calls for early institution of a commission of inquiry under un auspices to investigate and fix responsibility. we will welcome the commission to azad jammu & kashmir, and hope that india too, will do the same. to divert the world's attention from its brutalities, india frequently violates the ceasefire along the line of control in kashmir. despite numerous violations 6 pakistan has acted with restraint. but if india does venture across the loc, or acts upon its doctrine of ""limited"" war against pakistan, it will evoke a strong and matching response. madam president, strategic stability in our region has been and continues to be undermined. this is evident in different ways-by introduction of destabilizing weapon systems, pursuit of discriminatory approaches by certain states to supply advanced military hardware and sensitive technologies, and adoption of offensive force postures and doctrines, that imagine conflict beneath a nuclear threshold. under the circumstances, pakistan has no option but to maintain a minimum credible deterrence. we have been advocating for many years now, a strategic restraint regime for south asia. pakistan is ready to engage with india for meaningful confidence building, risk reduction and avoidance of arms race. madam president, let me also reiterate pakistan's continued support for strengthening of regional organizations as a platform for poverty alleviation and socio-economic uplift. the regional body for south asia, saarc has been rendered in effective due to the intransigence of one country. we remain fully committed to a functioning saarc that can improve the lives of the people of the region. madam president, afghanistan and together with it, pakistan, has suffered heavily at the hands of global power play, strategic miscalculations and cognitive dissonance. that there is no military solution to the war in afghanistan is now a foregone conclusion. it is time to act upon that conclusion. a negotiated settlement has assumed urgency in the face of the worrisome and growing presence of daesh in afghanistan. 7 pakistan will continue to lend its support to an afghan owned and afghan led process of peace and reconciliation. on the bilateral plane, our two countries have operationalized the afghanistan-pakistan action plan for peace and solidarity. it lays down the blueprint for extensive engagements in all areas of common interests. pakistan has hosted the longest protracted refugee presence of modem times. our role and sacrifices can perhaps be better appreciated when juxtaposed against the rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiments in nations, more resourceful and developed than ours, that have faced the brunt of fewer immigrants, over a shorter timescale. because of this protracted situation, afghanistan's security has a direct spill over impact on our own security and stability. we look forward to the safe, dignified and voluntary return of afghan refugees to their homeland. madam president, for the past seventeen years, pakistan at great cost of life and resources, has been combating the fires of terrorism and extremism. by the determined operations of our armed forces, and the full support of our people, pakistan has turned the tide against terrorism. with the deployment of 200,000 troops, pakistan has conducted the largest and most effective counter terrorism campaign in the world. peace and security have returned to our cities and towns. in our own national interest, and in line with our national action plan, we will continue to strengthen our counter terrorism frameworks and regimes. pakistan continues to face terrorism that is financed, facilitated and orchestrated by our eastern neighbor. we wanted to sit with india to discuss all issues, including terrorism, that have created violence in our cities and towns, and have led to tens of thousands of casualties of innocent pakistanis. pakistan shall never forget the mass murder of more than 150 children in a peshawar school, the terrible mastung attack and many others that have links with terrorists supported by india. and we will never forget the terrorist attack in india against samjhota 8 express carrying innocent pakistanis - and now its confessed perpetrators are being allowed to walk free. we wanted to share this evidence with india and the international community on who supported these acts of violence and terrorism. we have already shared this evidence with the un. we have in our custody a serving indian naval officer, commander kalbhushan yadav, who has provided us with the most incriminating evidence by accepting that he, on the instructions of his government, financed, planned and executed acts of terrorism and violence in pakistan. this is but one indian state sponsored official terrorist. many more are launched inside pakistan to create terror and mayhem by our eastern neighbor. and it is india, that in plain sight of the international community, perpetrates state sponsored terrorism in indian occupied jammu and kashmir and other parts of india. it is the concern of the united nations, as jammu and kashmir remains on the agenda of the un security council. and it is a matter of concern for the international community as humanity is being crushed and human rights being violated all over india, where people have stood up against oppression, occupation and to demand their fundamental rights. it is also a matter of concern of the international community that india has sponsored terrorism and aggression against all its neigbours. madam president, the strongest antidote to the poison of terrorism is development that yields dividends. the vision of belt and road is a path-breaking initiative by a world leader of great sagacity and foresight to create a community of common destiny. it is a global common good beneficial to all. our vision for china pakistan economic corridor is to help translate our goo-strategic potential into geo-economic dividend. pakistan looks to offer the vital connectivity nodes linking the middle east with western china, and affording central asia the shortest most feasible access to the sea. 9 madam president, the challenges of our times have enhanced, not diminished, the relevance of the united nations. the united nations must remain the central platform for dialog and diplomacy. for the un to remain relevant to the needs of the people and respond to the demands of the twenty first century, we believe that: one: sustainable development goals must be pursued in order to reduce inequality within and among nations. we hope the secretary general's high­ level event on financing the implementation of the 2030 agenda, earlier this week, will serve as a catalyst for rapid progress towards realizing the sdgs. two: corruption is a grave crime. those who provide safe haven to ill­ gotten wealth, are partners in the crime, and equally culpable. existing international conventions on corruption do not go far enough in addressing this malaise. it is time to return the looted wealth to their rightful owners, the people, and to take to task, both the perpetrators, and their abettors. three: climate change poses serious challenges to all states. the paris agreement must not be allowed to become hostage to sectoral interests. even as pakistan contributes minimally to global emissions, our country remains among the most vulnerable. our government completed the plantation of a billion trees proj ect in the khyber pakhtunkhwa province. we have now launched an ambitious project of planting 10 billion trees across pakistan. four: a rules-based global order is vital for promotion of international trade in goods and services as well as global nuclear commerce and governance mechanisms. carving out exemptions and bending established rules to suit partisan interests must be eschewed. five: an objective and transparent criterion must be evolved to facilitate trade in strategic goods and membership of groupings governing it. this is essential for countries pursuing economic growth and development. six: sanctity and integrity of international agreements must be maintained. strategic stability must be nurtured by policies of restraint and responsibility, not by considerations of profits and politics. 10 seven: technology and innovation are key to reshaping our states and societies. we must strike a prudent balance between guarding against misuse of emerging technologies and facilitating their access to developing countries. it is essential to develop universally agreed legal frameworks in the area of cyber security, lethal autonomous weapons system, artificial intelligence and weaponization of outer space. eight: dislocation of people in recent years, primarily because of wars but also due to pervasive poverty, has energized the global debate on refugees and migrants. the deliberations leading to the global compacts on refugees and migrants represent a step in the right direction. the true litmus test of . these compacts lies in the effective implementation of commitments. madam president, pakistan believes that a new consensus on peace, security and development, can and should be developed. a new paradigm for universal peace and prosperity is both desirable and achievable. pakistan will be a willing and able partner of the international community in this worthwhile pursuit. madam president, the challenges ahead are daunting; the road forward, untraveled, the route uncharted. these times call for deliberation and diligence, but also cooperation and concerted action. they call for a truly united, united nations. the kashmiri wife who lost her husband; the kashmiri school boy who lost his eye sight and his future to pellet gun injuries; the syrian father who saw his child drown, the palestinian girl who suffocates under siege, the african migrant willing to risk all for a better life, continue to look to this, the united nations for support and succor. let us not fail them any longer.","makhdoom shah mahmood qureshi, minister for foreign affairs of pakistan, noting his country’s elections two months ago, said the people had voted for reform, opting for a compassionate, peaceful and principled pakistan. the government is keen to pursue a policy of partnerships for peace and prosperity in its immediate neighborhood and beyond. a peaceful environment is necessary to promote the country’s development agenda, both at the national level and in the region. under the leadership of prime minister imran khan, integrated policies and programs have begun shaping a new pakistan. observing that forces of protectionism, populism and isolationism are gaining currency, he said that intolerance is ascendant over acceptance, rhetoric over reason and power over principle. “where the world needs bridges, we see fortifications,” he said, and “where it needs highways, we see blockades”. new forms of imperialism are emerging and multilateralism is retreating. the dark clouds of trade wars are looming larger on the horizon even as the challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, pandemics and transnational organized crime become more complex. pakistan desires a relationship with india that is based on sovereign equality and mutual respect, he stated. recalling that the two countries were to meet on the sidelines of the general assembly to talk, he said that india called off dialog for the third time. “they preferred politics over peace,” he said, adding that for 70 years, the people of occupied jammu and kashmir have struggled for their rights to self‑determination in the face of oppression by the indian occupation forces. there can be no lasting peace in south asia without a just settlement of the kashmir dispute, based on security council resolutions and the will of the kashmiri people, he stressed. the recently released report of the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights (ohchr) chronicles massive ongoing violations of human rights in indian‑occupied kashmir. turning to afghanistan, he stressed that there is no military solution to the war in afghanistan. pakistan will continue to support an afghan-owned and afghan‑led process of peace and reconciliation. that country’s security has a direct spillover impact on pakistan’s security. for the past 17 years, pakistan has been combating terrorism, and with the deployment of 200,000 troops, it has conducted the largest and most effective counter‑terrorism campaign in the world. further, pakistan continues to face terrorism that is financed, facilitated and orchestrated by its eastern neighbor. india, in plain sight of the international community, perpetrates state‑sponsored terrorism, he said, expressing hope for a new consensus on peace and security and development."
Palau,"remarks by his excellency tommy e. remengesau, jr. president of the republic of palau general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly 26th september 2018, new york madame president, mr. secretary-general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating her excellency ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her recent assumption of the presidency of the general assembly for its 73rd session becoming only the 4th woman to take this seat and first woman representing her region. palau welcomes you to this prominent role and i have no doubt that you will steer this canoe as our captain on our voyage towards agenda 2030 at this most important of forums of multilateralism in a unique and effective way, as demonstrated by the theme of the current general debate - making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. let me also express my gratitude to his excellency minister miroslav lajcak for his exceptional service during his recently completed term, recognizing initiatives undertaken during his term: on financing for sdgs, on health issues such as ncds, on water and youth among others. at the outset, i would like to ay my respects to a great leader and great humanitarian: our former un secretary general and nobel peace laureate, kofi annan. a friend and ally to all, mr. anan was the living embodiment of our mission to create peaceful, equitable, and sustainable societies. his contributions to building stronger and more effective international institutions laid the foundation for the important work we do today. this year, we also celebrate the legacy of nelson mandela, which continues to inspire the poor and oppressed to demand equal rights. in honor of the centenary of the birth of nelson mandela, the nelson mandela peace summit was an historic opportunity to reaffirm our faith in the principle and values of the un charter. 1 madame president, the republic of palau is committed to promoting peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies both at home and internationally, and we see the sustainable development goals as the most important framework for achieving our objective. the path that each country takes to achieve their goals will be unique, but we recognize that all are inter-linked and reinforce one another. for palau, our core priorities are health, oceans, and climate change, through which the rest of our development objectives through genuine and durable partnerships will be realized. palau has declared 2018 as the year of good health. at home we are implementing a number of events to raise awareness and cultivate healthier lifestyles to respond to the deadly problem of non-communicable diseases ncds. palau is ranked in the top 10 most obese countries in the world and i am afraid to say that while in other parts of the world people are dying of hunger and poverty, in our corner of the pacific, we are dying of overeating and poor diet. the rise in diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and other ncds are attributed to unhealthy diets, insufficient physical activity, excessive consumption of salt, sugar fat, alcohol and tobacco use. ncds are now the leading causes of death in palau. up to 75% of us will die from ncds prematurely. this crisis has prompted a strategic shift in focus at the ministry of health of palau toward increasing preventive services in an effort to improve the health and livelihood for our people. we are encouraging a return to traditional diets and increasing our local food production, as much of the problem stems from the importation of unhealthy junk good. however, in the case of tuberculosis, i am very happy to report that incidences of tuberculosis have been minimal and well under control over the years. madame president, the ocean for my country is our livelihood, our culture and our identity, which is why achieving sdg 14 is so critical for us. the ocean is also the foundation of our booming tourism industry, which will continue to be the largest jobs-provider in the country. we have launched a new campaign - pristine paradise palau. - which places sustainability front and center. 2 i have a firm belief that our environment is our economy; our economy is our environment. preserving our magnificent coral reefs and abundant fisheries will ensure tourism continues to grow, as well as protect our food security for generations to come. for this reason, we have moved aggressively to implement our national marine sanctuary - a no-take zone that covers 80% of our exclusive economic zone. it is palau s contribution to the global effort to achieve sdg 14. the value of the endemic marine biodiversity in palau is priceless and therefore we are eager to work with the scientific community to identify more ways to build the resilience of our coral reef ecosystems. we are proud of our domestic efforts, but international action remains essential. last year, the world gathered here in this great hall and declared that the ocean is sick and needs our unified global assistance to restore it to good health. this year, in response to this call for help, the prime minister of norway, the honorable erna solerberg and i, together with the governments of australia, chile, fiji, ghana, indonesia, jamaica, japan, mexico, namibia, portugal, and the un special envoy for oceans, launched the high-level panel for a sustainable ocean economy. this panel seeks solutions to building a transformative political agenda for ocean action and seek the development of a platform to deliver management and tracking of commitments, initiatives, partnerships including science-based monitoring of the ocean, featuring national and privatesector leadership. palau is also seeking a strong outcome to the intergovernmental conference on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, which will will be an important complement to our domestic actions. further on the horizon, my country will be proud to play host ofthe our oceans 2020 conference. that same year, portugal will host the united nations oceans conference. we need to identify our priorities and catalyze new coalitions so that the year 2020 comes to be remembered as a year of action. madame president, my government also takes very seriously its contribution to the paris agreement, which is also integral to our plans for achieving sdg 13 and other relevant goals. climate change isthe greatest challenge of our generation. just this month we once again sawthe damage that record-breaking cyclones bring to vulnerable countries like supertyphoon mangkhut brought to the philippines. buildingthe resilience ofvulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change must be an urgent global priority. 3 palau has developed a climate change policy framework with the objectives of undertaking effective adaptation measures to deal with expected impacts of climate change, strengthen our capacity to prepare and minimize disaster risks, and mitigate climate change by working towards low carbon emission through clean energy initiatives. meanwhile, we continue to work with our global and regional partners to build capacity and mainstream climate change into our national planning and budgeting process. small island developing states are making great strides in transforming their energy systems. as part of our vision for building a pristine paradise, palau has adopted ambitious international commitments to increase its supply of renewable energy by harnessing the power of the sun and transforming our energy sector to receive 45% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2025. smokestacks have no place in paradise. our target represents an extremely ambitious undertaking, but we are confident that, with the right partners, we can achieve our goal. we take very seriously our responsibility to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as part of the global effort to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees celsius. while palau emits a miniscule fraction of the global aggregate, we believe that the example we set can inspire many others to act. earlier this year, we took a big step forward by passing a law which modernized our electricity sector to enable a rapid transition to renewable energy. and now we have the enabling framework to trigger investments in transforming our economy towards harnessing the power of the sun. we can now envision that in the near future, the people and consumers will pay less cost for electricity and the financial savings will be distributed to areas where it is needed the most, for example health and education. one day very soon, visitors to our islands can be treated to not only a beautiful environment, but also a bold example of a more sustainable way of life. of course, all of this work depends on the dedication of our partners and their commitment to sdg17. our ambitious goals can only be attained with strong international partnerships that respect our national priorities and our independence. palau is fortunate to have many good friends and strong partners. we continue to strengthen our relationship with the united states of america through the compact of free association and we offer our gratitude for our unique relationship. we wish to gives special thanks to the united states of america for the approval of the amended financial provisions of our compact. 4 the government of japan has also provided generous support through the years, and i offer our sincere gratitude. their friendship, assistance, and support continue to strengthen our economic and social undertakings. we would like to express a special thanks to india for its recent efforts to expand and strengthen its partnership with my country. india has partnered with us to improve our youth initiatives, stronger family projects, and this year i have declared 2018 as the year of good health of which india is now a big partner to reform our health sector. we look forward to working through the indo-pacific strategy for assistance in the patrolling our maritime areas. cooperation in surveillance and enforcement of international law against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing will address a major challenge to sustainable fisheries, as well as improve regional security. the government of australia remains a strong partner in our maritime surveillance and enforcement efforts. we also recognize their support to the development of our ict sector through the world bank. the republic of china, taiwan has long been an ally in our efforts to achieve our sustainable development goals. this special friendship and generosity can be seen in our infrastructure investments, as well as continued assistance in health and education. we urge the united nations to seek a solution to include taiwan in all its process, including the international civil aviation organization and the world health organization. my government firmly believes that taiwan s inclusion in the un system will greatly benefit the un s work and its sustainable development agenda towards 2030 and beyond. palau is fortunate to have gained many newer partners and friends, and i would like to also recognize the european union, italy, indonesia, new zealand, russia, thailand, spain, singapore, korea, south africa, and many others. we remain committed to the need to ensure that nuclear weapons are never used again. there exists an inextricable connection between testing and the elimination of nuclear weapons. the legacy of more than 2,000 nuclear tests has touched people and communities in many regions including the victims of the nuclear testing in the pacific. nuclear tests have negatively impacted the environment, human health, food security and economic development. weapons of mass destruction have no place in this world and we urge achieving complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantling of such weapons and ballistic missiles of all ranges by north korea. the 5 global community must adhere to the fulfillment and the implementations of the relevant united nations security council resolution and uphold the international rule of law. i would like to commend the secretary-general guterres for initiating the un reforms, including the repositioning of the un development system. given the special status of our small island states in the context of vulnerability, remoteness and size, the reform underway is timely which also highlights the need for a strengthened role of un country teams and of the resident coordinator system, along with setting up their permanent offices in the region. we must ensure that the smallest countries are able to fully participate in the development of reform plans. palau also reiterates its call, as a member of the pacific small island developing states, for the appointment of a special representative of the secretary-general on climate and security, which would address a significant gap in the un system. madame president, building peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies is no longer an aspirational ideal. it is an absolute necessity for addressing the very grave economic, environmental, and humanitarian challenges facing the world. palau stands with you as we begin this 73rd session and as we continue working on this critical endeavor. thank you. 6","tommy esang remengesau, jr., president of palau, expressed his commitment to promoting peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies both at home and internationally. the sustainable development goals are the most important framework for achieving those objectives, he said, noting that while each country’s development path will be unique, all will be interlinked and reinforce one another. palau’s core priorities include health, oceans and climate change, through which the rest of its development objectives and durable partnerships will be realized. recalling that palau declared 2018 as the year of good health, he said it is already implementing several awareness-raising events to cultivate healthier lifestyles and respond to the deadly challenge of non-communicable diseases. expressing regret that palau is ranked among the world’s top 10 most obese nations — while people in other parts of the world are dying of hunger and poverty — he said his country’s citizens are in effect dying from overeating and poor diets. that crisis has prompted a strategic shift in focus at the country’s ministry of health, he said, adding that it is aimed at bolstering preventive services to improve health and livelihoods. “we are encouraging a return to traditional diets and increasing our local food production, as much of the problem stems from the importation of unhealthy junk food,” he said. turning to the health of the ocean — which is palau’s livelihood, culture and identity — he said the achievement of sustainable development goal 14 is a top priority for his country. “our environment is our economy, and our economy is our environment,” he said, noting that preserving coral reefs and abundant fisheries will ensure that the tourism sector grows and food security is maintained. for those reasons, palau has moved aggressively to implement is national marine sanctuary — a “no-take zone” covering 80 per cent of its exclusive economic zone. expressing pride in all those domestic efforts, he said international action nevertheless remains critical. welcoming the recent launch of the high-level panel for a sustainable ocean economy, he also expressed hope that the ongoing intergovernmental conference on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction will result in a strong outcome document to complement national actions. also expressing palau’s strong support for the paris agreement, he underscored the need to build the resilience of vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change as an urgent global priority. palau’s own climate change policy framework seeks to undertake effective adaptation measures, he continued, while also strengthening the country’s capacity to prepare for and minimize disaster risks and mitigating climate change through low-carbon emission clean energy initiatives. small island nations are making great strides in transforming their energy systems, and palau for its part is committed to increasing its supply of renewable energy by harnessing solar power and switching 45 per cent of its electricity to renewable sources by 2025. “smokestacks have no place in paradise,” he said, also outlining new laws that have modernized the country’s electricity sector and put in place enabling frameworks to trigger investments in solar power."
Palestine (State of),"permanent obsetvermission cfthe state of(palestine llji^lll i' ffcjff'oisea—as ^ to the vnitedl!nations statement by h.e. mr. mahmoud abbas president ofthe state ofpalestine united nations general assembly 73''^ session new york 27 september 2018 115 east 65^^ street new york. ny 10065 tel. (212) 288-8500 fax (212) 517-2377 jerusalem is not for sale and the palestinian people's rights are not up for bargaining in the name of god, the most merciful and beneficent excellency, ms. maria fernanda espinosa, president of the united nations general assembly, excellency, mr. antonio guterres, secretary-general of the united nations, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, in these days lastyear, i came before youappealing for freedom, independence andjustice for my oppressed people, who are suffering under israeli occupation for more than fifly-one years. i return to you today as this colonial occupation continues to suffocate us and to undermine our serious efforts to build the institutions of our cherished state, which this august general assembly recognized in the year 2012. this yearthe palestinian national council, the parliament of the state of palestine, convened and renewed the legitimacy of our national institutions through the election of a new leadership for the palestine liberation organization (plo), the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people. this parliament undertook important decisions, which oblige meto review theagreements, political, economic and security alike, that have been reached with the israeli government, and to also review the future of the palestinian national authority, which has been rendered without authority. the parliament also instructed me to suspend the palestinian recognition of israel until israel recognizes the state of palestine on the 4 june 1967 borders, and also instructed me to approach the international courts, including the international criminal court (icc), to investigate israel's breaches of treaties and the israeli occupying forces' aggressions and settler terror against our people, our land and our holy sites. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, last july, israel adopted a racist law that crossed all the red lines and called it the ""nation-state law of the jewish people"". this law denies the connection of the palestinian people to their historic homeland and dismisses their right to self-determination and their history and heritage, as well as the united nations resolutions relevant to the palestine question and the agreements concluded with israel. this law will inevitably lead to the creation ofone racist state, an apartheid state, and nullifies the two-state solution. this law discriminates against the palestinian-arab citizens in israel, granting the right to selfdetermination exclusively to jews in israel and legislating discrimination against those arab citizens, who constitute 20% of the population of israel, in addition to other non-jews who have immigrated to israel. this law strips them oftheir rights as citizens. this law constitutes a gross breach and real danger, both politicallyand legally, and reminds us of the apartheidstate that existed in south africa. we therefore reject and condenm it in the strongest terms. we further call on the international community and this august assembly to act to reject it and condemn it as a racist, illegal law and deem it null and void, just as the united nations condemned apartheid south africa in several resolutions in the past, bearing in mind also that thousands of jews and israeli citizens have rejected and protested this law and 56 knesset members out of 120 voted against it. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, this racist law talks about what is called the ""land of israel"". can you ask the israeli government what exactly constitutes the ""land of israel"", what the ""borders"" of the state of israel are? i challenge anyone to tell us what they are. this racist law constitutes another stigma on israel and anyone who consents to it. this law is just like other israeli laws that legislated the theft and confiscation ofthe land, properties and funds of the palestinian people. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, we have always fully and positively engaged with the various initiatives of the international communitythat have aimed at achieving a peaceful solution between us and the israelis, including the arab peace initiative, which was recognized by the security council in its resolution 1515 (2003). we continued on this path with the administration of president trump from the start of his tenure, with the same positive engagement, and i have met with him numerous times. we awaited his peace initiative with utmost patience, but were shocked by decisions and actions he undertook that completelycontradict the role and commitment ofthe united states towards the peace process. in november 2017, his administration issued a decision to close the plo office in washington, dc. he then announced his recognition of jerusalem as the capital of israel and transferredhis country's embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, and boasts that he has removed the issues of jerusalem, refugees, settlements and security offthe negotiation table. all such decisions threaten the palestinian national cause and constitute an assault on international law and relevant united nations resolutions. the us administration went even further in its assault by cutting assistance to the palestinian national authority, unrwa and palestinian hospitals in occupied east jerusalem. with all ofthese decisions, this administration has reneged on all previous us commitments, and has undermined the two-state solution, and has revealed its false claims of concern about the humanitarian conditions ofthe palestinianpeople. it is ironicthat the american administration still talks about what they call the ""deal ofthe century"". but what is left for this administration to give to the palestinian people? humanitarian solutions? and, the us congress continues to insist on considering the palestine liberation organization which is recognized as the sole, legitimate representative of the palestinian people by the overwhelming majority of countries of the world, including israel - as a terrorist organization, at a timewhen the stateof palestine cooperates withthe majority of countries of the world, including the united states, to combat terrorism. for years, we have affirmed our readiness to the us administration to establish a palestinianamericancommittee to examine the political and legal status ofthe flo as a means of proving to them that the flo is committed to achieving peace and combating terrorism, as well as to also demonstrate that congress' legislation regarding the flo is arbitrary, unlawful and unjustified and deliberately ignores the official agreement with the us government to combat terrorism, an agreement we have also concluded with 83 other countries. despite all of this, and from this august platform, i renew my call to president trump to rescind his decisions and decrees regarding jerusalem, refugees and settlements, which contravene international law and un resolutions, as well as the understandings among us, in order to salvage the prospects for peaceandto achieve stability and security for the futuregenerations in our region. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, consistent with our commitment to peace and the two-state solution and the path of negotiations to achieve them, a path we have never refused, and with a view to rescuing the peace process, i came before the security council on the 20*^ of february this year and presented an initiative calling for the convening ofan international peace conference basedon the relevant un resolutions and the internationally-endorsed terms of reference and parameters. such a conference should involve broad international participation that includes regional and international stakeholders, led by the permanent members of the security council and the quartet. we shall circulate this initiative in its entirety to you and hope you will support it. here, i must reiterate that we are not against negotiations and have never rejected negotiations, and that we continue to extend our hands for peace. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, peace in our region cannot be realized without an independent palestinian state, with east jerusalem as its capital, and not some place in east jerusalem as its capital, and with all of its holy sites. there is no peace otherwise. there is no peace with a state of temporary borders. there is no peace with an alleged state in gaza. the path to peace is enshrined in your resolutions, including resolution 67/19 of 29 november 2012, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority and refers to the state of palestine on the basis of the 1967 borders. i thus call upon all the countries ofthe world that have not yet recognized the state of palestine to accelerate this long-overdue recognition. i can no longer see a convincing reason for the continued delay of recognition of the state of palestine by some countries. in this context, i wish to draw your attention to the fact that, in 2019, the state of palestine will chair the group of 77, which represents 134 states, and i urge you to support the request to enhance the state of palestine's status during its tenure and to allow it to exercise its fiill responsibilities on behalf of this group. in this regard, i wish to convey our appreciation and gratitude to colombia for its recent recognition ofthe state of palestine, becoming the 139^ state to recognize our state, and likewise to paraguay, which had previously recognized the state of palestine and decided to return its embassy from jerusalem to tel aviv, and i urge guatemala to do the same. here, i must once again call upon the british government - which bears a historical, political, legal and moral responsibility with regard to the suffering and displacement of the palestinian people as a consequence of the balfour declaration of 1917 - to rectify this historic mistake by recognizing the state of palestine and compensating the palestinian people for their pain and suffering. i also call upon the united states of america, which strongly supported the balfour declaration and cooperated with great britain to implement it, to do the same. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, i must remind you once again that israel, the occupying power, has not implemented any single resolution of the hundreds of resolutions adopted by the security council, most recent of which was resolution 2334 (2016), and by the general assembly regarding the question of palestine. is it acceptablethat israel remains without accountability or consequence? is it acceptable that israel remains a state above the law? why does the security council not uphold its duties to compel israel to abide by international law and to bring an end to its occupation ofthe state of palestine? madamepresident, distinguished representatives gathered here in this general assembly, we resist this colonial, settler israeli occupation through the legitimate means created by this international organization. foremost among these is peaceful, popular resistance as we witness today in the great march ofreturn in gaza. wc also see it in other areas ofour occupied territory, such as in khan al-ahmar, which the israeli government has decided to forcibly uproot and displace its palestinian inhabitants, who have lived there for more than 50 years, in order to illegally impose settlement activities in that area and to sever the contiguity of the palestinian state. our palestinian people and the territory of the state of palestine are in more urgent need of international protection than at any time before. here, allow me to express our deep appreciation and respect to the states that supported the resolution on protection for the palestinian civilian population, which was adopted on 13june 2018, and to urge you to find the mechanisms necessary to provide protection as soon as possible. we also express our thanksto the secretary-general for his report in this regard. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, whilewe welcome all the economic and humanitarian supportto our people in the west bank and the gaza strip through the legitimate palestinian institutions, we refuse that this support be considered a substitute to a political solution that would bringan end to the israeli occupation and achieve the independence of the state of palestine on the ground. this support also cannot be considered an alternative to lifting the israeli blockade and ending the division between gaza and the west bank, and we will fu*mly stand against any attempts, under any pretext, to separate our beloved gaza from our state. we continue to exert genuine, serious efforts to end the division and to achieve reconciliation. despite the many obstacles to achieving these aims, we continue to uphold our responsibilities towards our people. we express our appreciation to our arab brethren, in particular the fraternal arab republic of egypt, for the efforts being undertaken to end this division, hoping that they will besuccessful. my government - the national consensus government - affirms its readiness to uphold its full responsibilities in the gaza strip once it is allowed to exercise its full authority and in the framework of one palestinian political system, one sole legitimate authority, one law and one legitimate weapon. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, after all that i have said in my statements before tliis distinguished general assembly, let me sum up: • we are not a people that can be excluded on this earth; we are an indigenous people and our roots are deep across five thousand years. we insist on fairness towards us and the implementation of your resolutions. • we have concluded agreements with israel and they have abrogated all of them. either israel abides by these agreements, or else we will renege on them. israel will bearthe responsibility and consequences ofthis. • there are also agreements with the us administration, but why have they reneged on all of them, and how should we address this? please answer me. either it respects its commitments, or we are not going to comply with any of these agreements. we will also not accept sole american mediation in the peace process because the us administration has lost its eligibility due to its recent decisions. • we have also concluded agreements withhamas. eithertheyimplement themfully, or we will distance ourselves from any agreements or measures that are concluded withoutour approval and will not bear any responsibility. • lastly, allow me to reaffirm to you that we will not revert to violence and terror, no matter what the situation or conditions are. madame president, ladies and gentlemen, i paytribute to all freedom-loving countries and peoples that continue to extend political, financial and humanitarian assistance to our people in their struggle to bring an end to the occupation, to strengthen our institutions in preparation for fiill independence, and in support of unrwa. i urge the general assembly to ensure support to this agency as a matter of international responsibility. unrwa was established by a general assembly resolution [302(iv)] in 1949 and was mandated to provide assistance to the palestine refugees until the achievement of a just and permanent solution for their plight. in conclusion, i salute our resilient and brave people in palestine, in the refugee camps and in the diaspora with deepest respect and admiration for their heroic stances and their great sacrifices in defense of our people's inalienable rights in their homeland and their rights to self-determination and an independent state, with east jerusalem as its eternal capital. it is inevitable that we will achieve our freedom and independence and that we will celebrate the independence of our democratic state despite the occupation's illusions. i pay tribute to our honorable martyrs and courageous prisoners and say to all palestinians that we are soon approaching our day of freedom and independence and that the darkness of occupation will soon vanish. peace and god's mercy be upon you. palestinian political initiative first: we call for the convening of an international peace conference by mid-2018, based on international law and the relevant un resolutions, with broad international participation and including the two concerned parties and the regional and international stakeholders, foremost among them the permanent members of the security council and the international quartet, as was the framework for the paris peace conference and as envisaged for the conference to be convened in moscow as per resolution 1850 (2008). the outcomesofthis conference shouldbe as follows: a. acceptance ofthe state ofpalestine as a full member ofthe united nations and a call on the security council to achieve that, taking into account general assembly resolution 67/19 of 29 november 2012, and guaranteeing international protection for our people. b. mutual recognition between the state of palestine and the state of israel on the basis of the 1967 borders. c. formation of an international multilateral mechanism that will assist the two parties in the negotiations to resolve the permanent status issues defined in the oslo accords (jerusalem, borders, security, settlements, refugees, water and prisoners), conduct those negotiations on the basis of international law and the relevant un resolutions, and implement what is to be agreed upon within a set timeframe and with guarantees for this implementation. second: during the period of negotiations, all parties must refrain from unilateral actions, particularly those that would prejudge the outcome of a final solution, as set forth in article 31 of the oslo accords of 1993. foremost must be the cessation of settlement activities in the territory occupied since 1967, including east jerusalem, and suspension of the decision regarding jerusalem and halting transfer of the us embassy to jerusalem, in compliance with the relevant security council resolutions, including in particularresolutions476 (1980), 478 (1980), 2334 (2016), and general assemblyresolutiones-lo/19. at the same time, the stateofpalestinewould refrain from further joining organizations, as we have previously committed ourselves to. (namely 22 international organizations out of 500 organizations and treaties.) third: implementation of the arab peace initiative, as adopted and endorsed, and the conclusion of a regional agreement upon achievement of a peace agreement between the palestinians and israelis. in this regard, we must reaffirm the terms ofreference for any upcoming negotiations and they are as follows: 1. respect for international law and the relevant resolutions, including security council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) through to resolution 2334 (2016), and the arab peace initiative, and the signed agreements. 2. preservation of the principle of the two-states, i.e. the state of palestine, with east jerusalem as its capital, hving side by side with the state of israel in peace and security on the basis of the 4 june 1967 borders, and rejection of partial solutions and a state of provisional borders. 3. acceptance of minimal land swaps, in equal value and ratio, with the agreement between the two parties. 4. east jenisalem as the capital of the state of palestine and an open city for the faithful of the three monotheistic religions. 5. ensuring the security of the two states without underrnining the independence and sovereignty of either of them through the existence of an international third party. 6. a just and agreed solution for the palestine refugees on the basis of resolution 194 (iii) and in accordance with the arab peace initiative and, pending a just solution, continuation ofthe international commitment and support to unrwa.","mahmoud abbas, president of the state of palestine, said he has returned to the general assembly to appeal for the freedom, independence and justice for his oppressed people who have been suffering under the yoke of israeli occupation for more than 51 years. he recalled this year’s decision by the palestinian national council to suspend palestinian recognition of israel until israel recognizes the state of palestine. that council also decided to approach the international criminal court to investigate israel’s treaty violations and acts of aggression by israeli occupying forces. the “nation-state law of the jewish people” adopted by israel in july is a racist law that will lead to the creation of an apartheid state and nullify the two-state solution, he said, calling on the international community and the general assembly to declare it null and void, just as they condemned apartheid in south africa. he expressed shock at decisions taken by the president of the united states to close the palestine liberation organization office in washington, d.c., recognize jerusalem as israel’s capital, transfer the united states embassy to that city, and end support to the palestinian national authority and the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east (unrwa). he called on the united states president to rescind those decisions, which went against international law and united nations resolutions, and salvage the prospects for peace. he recalled his proposal to the security council on 20 february for an international peace conference based on relevant united nations resolutions and internationally-endorsed terms of reference. palestinians have never rejected negotiations and they continue to extend their hands for peace, he said. there can be no peace without an independent palestinian state with east jerusalem — “not some place in east jerusalem” — as its capital, he continued. noting that the state of palestine will chair the group of 77 developing countries and china in 2019, he called on all countries that have not yet done so — including the united kingdom and the united states — to recognize the state of palestine expeditiously. emphasizing that israel, the occupying power, has not implemented any relevant general assembly or security council resolution, including resolution 2334 (2016), and that illegal settlement activity continues, he said the palestinian people and their state are in more urgent need of international protection that at any time before. while economic and humanitarian support to palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip is welcome, it cannot substitute for a political solution that will end the israeli occupation and achieve independence for the state of palestine on the ground, he pointed out. nor can it be an alternative to lifting the israeli blockade or ending the division between the west bank and gaza. palestinians must be viewed as humans, he said, adding: “we are not redundant.” israel and the united states must abide by their agreements with the palestinians, who will otherwise be unable to uphold their commitments, he said. underscoring the role of the quartet for middle east peace, he said the united states alone cannot act as a mediator because it has too much bias towards israel. on palestinian reconciliation, he said the state of palestine cannot bear responsibility for the failure of hamas to fulfill its obligations, and he urged the assembly to ensure support for unrwa. despite the injustice they face, the palestinians will never resort to violence and terrorism. he called on the palestinian people to remain steadfast and to continue to make sacrifices until independence and self-determination are achieved, with east jerusalem as their capital."
Panama,,"juan carlos varela rodríguez, president of panama, highlighted the extensive progress made in his country towards achieving the sustainable development goals, which was adopted as a state policy. by tackling corruption head-on, improving housing, access to education and potable water, in four years panama, among other successes, was able to rebuild entire cities and bring 150,000 of its citizens out of poverty. as well, preventive health treatment programs were instituted in response to a national health census and the panamanian education system is being transformed into one that is bilingual. he also spotlighted the successful completion of the canal expansion which illustrated his country’s permanent neutrality and openness to international trade. the canal, an interoceanic route, was recovered by the panamanians thanks to the treaties of the panama canal, and the decision of the former president of the united states, jimmy carter. noting that his country has welcomed tens of thousands of people looking for a better future, he brought attention to the plight of migrants in the region, notably the 100,000 haitians who fled their country after the earthquake. further, the lessons of the migratory crisis are a call to the government of venezuela to re-establish dialog and democracy. migratory movements can only be resolved by dealing with the root causes that compel these people to leave their country, underscoring his country’s participation in the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. warning that violations of human rights and fundamental liberties in nicaragua could generate additional migration movements, he also called on that government and the country’s social actors to renew the political dialog and thereby find peace. as well, the united states should recognize the steps taken by cuba to open its economy. the political crisis in venezuela, the increase in drug production in colombia, the scourge of corruption, and the tense situation in nicaragua require that countries in the region redouble their efforts to return to the path of social peace, he said. his country is committed, together with multilateral organizations, to work for a better world. towards that end, the regional logistic center for humanitarian assistance will be inaugurated in panama. concluding, he stressed that in the future, the question will not be “how power is obtained but how it is used for the benefit of the people”."

secretary-general of the united nations; excellency's and distinguished delegates. today, i am pleased to, address the general assembly on behalf of my prime minister, the honorable peter o'neill, and

the outgoing president miroslav lajcak for his excellent work this past year. it is also important to commend the leadership of the secretarygeneral for reform of the united nations and its systems, the un being an organization that is so fundamental to the peace, prosperity and security of the world. madam president, this is an exciting year for papua new guinea as we host the asia pacific economic cooperation forum known as apec. by doing so, our country is emerging on to the global stage like never before. located in the pacific ocean, we are part of a vast blue continent of island nations linked by sea. we also border with southeast asia and are within sight of australia. we have more than eight million people, the biggest economy and the largest land mass of the pacific island countries. we are joining with our pacific sisters and brothers in a mighty regional endeavor to protect the ocean and its bounty, and to bring prosperity to our peoples. nations near and far are learning that our country, papua new guinea, is a great treasury of riches. we have the third biggest rainforest in the world after brazil and the congo. we are guardians of a third of the global supply of tuna, the fish that feeds the world. our land is home to vast storehouses of gold, silver, nickel, oil and gas. we are one people forged together from more than 1000 tribes. with more than 800 distinct languages we are the most linguistically diverse nation on earth. yes, we have issues that all developing countries face but we are not letting them daunt us as we strive for progress and prosperity. this year, we are taking a giant stride as we host the asia pacific economic cooperation forum. the apec economies encompass 39 per cent of the world's population a nd 48 per cent of the world's trade. it.involves the united states, the people's republic of china, japan as well as other significant economies. apec itself is, in many ways, a regional example of attempts to achieve what all the members of the united nations are working so hard to accomplish. many issues are on the table either formally or in informal meetings on the sidelines: 1. prosperity through free trade- the founding rationale for apec plus 2. cleaning up and protecting the natural environment; 3. inclusiveness so that none of our precious human beings are left behind; 4. embracing the digital economy; 5. and— very importantly, gender equality. international trade is an important engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty eradication as well as a critical source to finance development and achieving sustainable development. as apec host we have opportunities like never before. it is the largest international event in our country's history. we are well prepared for the leaders' summit in mid-november 2018, and the world will see the stunning apec haus, an outstanding architectural creation inspired by local culture. we thank all apec member economies for their material organizational support, and particularly 1. australia 2.canada and 3. china. 4. indonesia 5.japan 6.new zealand 7. singapore 8. south korea and 9. the united states, and others too many to mention to add to the pacific island flavor of the event, we have invited pacific island leaders to come to our country during this time. through apec we have opportunities to attract trade and direct foreign investment. it will continue to provide us with access to the knowledge and experience of leading economies and to have dialog with apec economy leaders in attendance. this capacity building support in our country will lead directly to business growth and the creation of more jobs for our people. however-given our small and open economy which is subject to external forces —we join in the calls for the respect for and strengthened rules-based, multilateral trading system. hosting this event is a huge challenge for a developing country such as ours. but, madam president, people can sometimes paralyze themselves by focusing only on their perceived shortfalls or thdr problems. but we decided to give it a go. this also applies to our view of the united nations and its work. of course we must acknowledge and work to eliminate the great problems we are confronting. but when doing so, let us all keep our eyes on the prize, our vision of peace, security, a return to a pristine environment, and an ongoing prosperity. the key to overcoming these varied challenges lies in ""we the peoples of the united nations"". let us work on being united, being stronger together, in a system based on mutual respect, friendship, dialog and multilateralism. unity is the answer. it is the greatest power on the planet. madam president, two weeks ago, papua new guinea celebrated her forty-third anniversary of independence as an unbroken democracy. we continue to consolidate our economic and structural reforms supported by responsible monetary and fiscal policies aimed at a balanced budget. with recovering global oil and gas prices and several new major energy and mining projects well advanced, we are optimistic about our future economic outlook. madam president, the 2030 agenda for sustainable development is a solid pathway that holds much promise for the international community. the choice to enjoy its full potential lies in our hands. at the pacific regional level, earlier this month in nauru, our forum leaders reaffirmed our collective commitment. the call for collective action is in the boe declaration, a copy of which was delivered by 5 pacific leaders to the secretary-general of the united nations yesterday. at the national level, we recognize the importance of putting in place the basic building blocks needed to enable successful, inclusive and participatory sustainable development. both australia and new zealand, our good friends, have eloquently addressed this august assembly on issues facing our region and the world, and the requirements and obligations for collective action. madam president, an essential part of our development challenge is harnessing the vastly untapped potential of our increasing youth population, which today constitute almost 60 percent of our population. creating employment opportunities in both the formal and informal sectors is a key priority to address the needs of our youth in the country.we have hopes for the transformative nature of the digital economy, which is a game changer. in addition, one of our greatest challenges is to protect women and girls, to ensure they have full equality in our society. this is a fundamental human right. we have a long way to go in this area. we are determined to find ways to progress for the women and girls themselves and for the good of the nation. in fact, our long term advancement depends on great improvements in this one crucial area. we are working hard to do this via policies and laws, combating gender-based violence, providing business opportunities in the formal and informal sectors such as micro-credit schemes and investing in our girls and women's education at all levels of our education system. the 6 changes are noticeable as we have put in an additional one million more young people to schools, and in particular, girls. we express our gratitude for the support of our muitilaterai and bilateral development partners, including the united nations system in assisting in more ways than one to achieve our goais. madam president, we are preparing our people to cope with the increasing dangers arising out climate, which are reai for us. earlier this month, as i have said, at the pacific isiand leaders forum in nauru, we reaffirmed our strong commitment to work together combat the adverse impacts of climate change under the un framework convention on climate change and the paris agreement and through other frameworks for the resilient deveiopment of the pacific region. the boe communique of the pacific leaders' forum put our position beyond doubt. we therefore strongly welcome the secretary-general's climate summit in september 2019. madam president, in february this year, papua new guinea experienced a tragic and unprecedented earthquake, the worst in our history. it hit five of our provinces, killed nearly 200 people, and displaced nearly six hundred thousand others. many others were injured and traumatized. vital infrastructure was destroyed. the nationai economy slowed. compounding our situation were two separate voicanic eruptions. we sympathize with such other countries as indonesia, japan, the phiiippines, china and the united states, the countries of the caribbean and others who have been affected in recent months by natural disasters and climate change induced challenges. we express our gratitude to our bilateral and multilateral development partners, including the un system, australia, new zealand, china, japan, and others, as well as the private sector and civil society groups, who stood with us in our time of need. we are revamping our disaster-related plans. madam president, we welcome efforts to replenish climate finance in the green climate fund and thank the contributors for your generosity. improved access and in a timely manner is imperative, especially for small island developing countries, like ours to benefit from this important support to help us to mitigate, adapt and build resilience to the ravages of climate change adverse impacts and natural disasters. again this is a call for collective global action that all small island developing states seek. madam president, our government notes the increasing interest from the international community on the imminent referendum in papua new guinea's autonomous region of bougainville in june 2019, under the bougainville peace agreement. we are fully committed to the agreement. we have appointed, this year, the former irish prime minister mr. bertie ahern to preside over the work of the bougainvitle referendunt commission. we are keen for the commission to begin its mandate soon. we are grateful to our multilateral and bilateral development partners including the united nations, for working together with us on this important national issue. we want to emphasize that the work of this partnership should in no way undermine the sovereignty of papua new guinea over its territory, in accordance with international law. madam president, we welcome the easing of tensions in the korean peninsula and commend efforts made by all parties involved and further encourage peaceful dialog. we support the moves to keep sanctions in place, not as a punishment, but as a real incentive to get rid of nuclear weapons to implement fully all un security council resolutions and to bring prosperity to the peoples of the dprk. we applaud and support in that respect, the efforts of the president of the general assembly to draw global attention to the dangers of the weapons of mass destruction. for our part, we are working towards signing the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. madam president, let me take this opportunity to share with this assembly the current status of the refugees and migrants on our manus island. the processing center was officially closed by my government on 31 october 2017 following the decision of our supreme court in april 2016. we are therefore working closely with australia in resettling qualified asylum seekers, including in the us. other migrants still remain in papua new guinea. each will be addressed case-by-case. 9 that is our contribution to the extent possible, in partnership with australia, to address human trafficking, people smuggling and transnational crime. madam president, as a maritime nation, the oceans agenda continues to be of great importance to us as it contributes significantly to our nation's wellbeing. we are working to ensure fair and equitable returns from our marine resources, particularly in combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in papua new guinea's territorial waters. we are grateful or the close cooperation of likeminded countries in wto who are working to address harmful fisheries subsidies that foster luu fishing. at the pacific islands forum, under our blue pacific continent theme, we have agreed to: * secure the region's maritime boundaries * to work to eliminate marine litter * to enhance maritime surveillance to deter illicit activities. madam president, as i conclude i want to draw your attention once again to our country as we prepare to host the apec leaders' summit. as the world increasingly turns its attention to the pacific ocean, we are witnessing the enhanced iriferest of a range of couhtfies, suctt as australia, china, france, new zealand the united kingdom and the united states. 10 as one of the nations of the blue pacific continent, we welcome that interest. however, we urge ail to play an appropriate role according to the accepted rules of the international order, so that the pacific ocean will be a zone of cooperation, of stability and security, of pristine beauty and prosperity. and may i conclude. madam president, by expressing the fervent hope of ail our peoples that the pacific ocean forever lives up to its name— the ocean of peace. i thank you. madam president. 11","rimbink pato, minister for foreign affairs of papua new guinea, said his country was set to host the asia‑pacific economic cooperation (apec) forum and emerge onto the global stage like never before. as the largest pacific island economy, papua new guinea, with its rich natural resources, is joining other countries in the region to protect the ocean. the forum seeks to promote prosperity through trade, protect the environment, foster inclusive policymaking and defend gender equality. further, international trade is an important engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty eradication, he said, calling for respect of the rules‑based multilateral trade system. marking the forty‑third anniversary of papua new guinea’s independence, he said efforts continue to consolidate economic and structural reforms; the country’s economic outlook is positive. the 2030 agenda for sustainable development is a solid pathway towards improved livelihoods. his government recognizes the importance of putting in place the building blocks needed to enable inclusive and participatory development. creating employment opportunities is essential to addressing the needs of the country’s youth. in addition, one of the greatest challenges facing the country is ensuring women and girls enjoy full equality. to that end, legislation is in place to combat gender‑based violence. guided by the paris agreement, regional leaders are reaffirming their strong commitment to work together to combat the adverse effects of climate change, he continued. papua new guinea recently experienced a tragic and unprecedented earthquake which killed nearly 200 people and displaced 600,000. the event destroyed vital infrastructure and resulted in an economic slowdown, he noted, thanking international partners who have provided assistance and are helping revamp disaster response plans. he also welcomed efforts to replenish climate finance in the green climate fund, stressing that improved access to financing is especially important for small island developing states. papua new guinea remains committed to the 2019 referendum in the autonomous region of bougainville as outlined in the bougainville peace agreement. his government welcomes the easing of tensions in the korean peninsula and commends efforts to encourage peaceful dialog. providing an update of the status of refugees and migrants on manus island, he said the island’s migrant processing center officially closed last year and efforts are under way to resettle qualified asylum seekers. efforts are also under way to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in the country’s territorial waters. the pacific islands forum is working to secure the region’s maritime borders and eliminate marine litter. he urged the international community to engage with pacific island states according to accepted international norms so the region can be characterized by stability and security."
Paraguay,,"mario abdo benítez, president of paraguay, said that in an increasingly interconnected world, the global community must collectively rise to challenges, with the general assembly representing the voice of all nations. however, the security council must become more inclusive and democratic to better serve the world and future generations. supporting the secretary‑general’s broad reform efforts across the organization, he said an efficient and transparent united nations must play its crucial role in helping member states to implement the 2030 agenda, particularly landlocked developing countries. indeed, world leaders must take up the fight against poverty, addressing it as a human problem and not simply an economic indicator, he said, providing examples of how paraguay is tackling poverty‑related challenges by widening access to education and boosting collective prosperity, with a focus on youth, persons with disabilities and women. turning to global challenges, he said terrorism and transnational crime continues to plague many nations. for its part, paraguay launched a campaign to combat the drug trafficking and continues to work with allies to crush crime in all its forms. to address global climate change challenges, the world faces a crucial decision — to stop it now or to deny it and continue to worsen the situation. states committed to the paris agreement on climate change must work to implement it. doing so is part of paraguay’s strategic development vision, as is fighting corruption and impunity while strengthening institutions. highlighting national achievements and concerns, he said paraguay has one of the most open economies and supported economic integration. however, some countries in his region are dealing with dictatorships. still, every nation faces specific challenges while moving towards sustainable development, with vulnerable states requiring special attention, including landlocked developing countries, who needed targeted efforts to boost trade. he urged states, particularly trading partners and transit countries, to consider those needs. turning to issues of security, he said paraguay supports the arms trade treaty and the convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons and is committed to united nations peacekeeping operations. paraguay also considers that taiwan should be included in the united nations membership. as the world is poised to adopt two major compacts, on orderly migration and on refugees, he said paraguay has been involved in both important processes. the united nations must continue playing a major role in ensuring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedom for all people. the 2030 agenda is the beginning of a change that will impact present and future generations. the success of the agreement will depend on how committed states are, he said, appealing to the world alliance to work towards achieving all the 2030 agenda goals and targets. given the current international landscape, pockmarked with political uncertainty and a volatile economy, he said all states must forge a collective drive to tackle challenges. at this point, he said, either each state can try to impose itself on others and hope to get the best it can, or the world can work together towards common goals with multilateral instruments and through cooperation. to achieve that, efforts must be unwavering in committing to meet the many challenges of the entire human race, he concluded."
Peru,,"martín alberto vizcarra cornejo, president of peru, highlighted reforms he recently put in place to fight corruption as his country overcame a political crisis. peru will promote the adoption by the general assembly of a resolution on corruption, with the goal of strengthening cooperation in this area, he stated, recalling that that scourge deviates 5 per cent of gross domestic product (gdp) every year to enrich a few at the expense of those in need. peru is one of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change, he said. it needs to emerge from poverty and requires investments to foster growth because the poorest segments of the population are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. to achieve the sustainable development goals — which have been included in its national development plan — peru intends to involve citizens and the private sector. he stressed that special efforts will be made to overcome the structural inequalities that women and girls face, guarantee their human rights and empower them. noting that nationalist discourses promoting protectionism, discrimination and xenophobia are resurfacing, he reaffirmed peru’s commitment to multilateralism and free trade. he called on other countries to make the same commitment and avoid protectionist practices. he reiterated his “unshakable solidarity” with the people of venezuela, and called for an urgent response to the severe humanitarian crisis in that country and the massive flow of migrants and refugees it has caused in the entire region."
Philippines,"phi' tppines 73rd session of the un general assembly general debate 29 september 2018, new york statement of h.e. alan peter s. cayetano secretary of foreign affairs republic of the philippines madame president, the parable of the persistent widow we all grew up with stories, anecdotes and parables. stories that inspire and give us hope, build our character and spark the determination to change the world. we are told these stories at home, in schools and in places of worship. thus, we come out of adolescence and enter adulthood with such idealism that we know in our heart that we can change the world. that we are here to unite and not to divide, to heal and not to hurt. this is the same spirit of idealism we feel the first time we enter the united nations. unfortunately, as time goes by, many if not most of us are changed by this world. we become victims of pragmatism rather than champions of idealism. and as things get complicated and struggles get more difficult, we are tempted to simply do what is already being done and accept that we cannot solve the problem. when this happens, we settle for a statement from the majority rather than a broad consensus on how to solve the problem. philippine mission tgj-the united nations 556 fifth avenue, new york, ny 10036 • tel. (212) 764-1300 • fax (212) 840-860 this reminds us that persistence is good, but it doesn't mean that we should be repetitive and simply keep doing the same thing. albert einstein defined stupidity as ""doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" while certainly there is no stupidity in the un, yet a tendency to just keep doing the same thing seems to plague us all. trying new things is a challenge, it might or might not work but we shouldn't be afraid of trying, not be afraid of failing. what we should fear is stagnating. that we as a community of nations end up accepting failure and make ourselves feel better by doing something , even if this something is the same thing that precisely failed to address the issues and solved the problems. the good news is that there is persistence in what we call, hope, in idealism and in the aspiration of wanting to change the world. we teach our children “to love god and to love our neighbor . but do we actually practice what we preach. so much inhumanity has been done in the name of god, and so little is being done at times for our neighbors. we live in a world that is fast becoming bigger, but also constantly getting smaller. from families to clans, to tribes to a federation of tribes we call a nation, from there we are a global village. and with tools like the internet and social media, everything is known and communicated in real time. thus, nowadays we are all neighbors, all members of the global community. being connected to each other all the time has transformed the world into a global community and we are all citizens of the world. today, our social contract is no longer confined to our nation state. we should therefore exert efforts to connect, to emphasize commonalities and not differences, to think that we are less filipinos, americans, chinese, french or russians, and think more of ourselves as global citizens, the people of the united nations. yes, it is true that we need not always act with a united front or as a community. but neither can we ignore the fact that there are many problems which can only be solved by a united global community. 2 whether it is issues on protecting the environment, extreme weather conditions, poverty and inequality, rule of law, countering terrorism and violent extremism: these are problems or challenges that we can only solve together. together we can find pragmatic idealism, that will give us hope, and the momentum to do more. love thy neighbor! migration is a reality, a fact, something that will continue to grow. issues on migration cannot be swept under the rug, but should be discussed openly, frankly and thoroughly. the global compact on migration is a huge step in the right direction. and this huge step will be even bigger if we can get everyone on board. again, love thy neighbor. thank you pope francis, un secretary general guterres and all the countries who stood together for the gcm. thank you migrants around the world for inspiring us to have the first, inter-governmentally negotiated compact to cover holistically and comprehensively all dimensions of international migration. the philippines under the leadership of president rodrigo roa duterte is one with the un in being uncompromising on the issues of rule of law, just and equitable peace that leads to order, development and prosperity, and the protection of each and every human beings rights. as a sovereign and democratic country led by duly-elected president, we are on track in salvaging our deteriorating country from becoming a narco-state or a state held hostage by the rich and powerful who ignore the plight of the poor, powerless and marginalized, or both. the hunger for change, for peace, for law and order is genuine. there is passion to improve our economy, so that 10 million filipinos abroad may choose to work at home or abroad, and not be forced by poverty to find high paying jobs at the expense of leaving the country and separating from their families. and those at home may at the very least live a safe and comfortable life. we may so etimes differ in how we express ourselves, yet this should not be interpreted as turning our backs on the universal declaration on human rights. on the contrary, we are instituting all of these reforms to be able to protect the rights of every single filipino. yes, rights of all filipinos, if that is at all possible. but in cases where we have to choose between protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens and law 3 enforcers versus the rights of drug lords and criminals, it is clear we will protect the former. who wouldn t? wouldn’t you do the same? challenges will always be there, but so will hope! hope leads to faith, and faith with actions produces miracles. the united nations is the place, the venue of great opportunity, of putting action to our faith, of changing the world for the better. that is of course if we can transcend our personal and sometimes national interest, for the interest of the global community, or simply put for the greater good. faith without action is dead. and the united nations is not a place to bury our dead, it is a place to rise up, to resurrect our hopes and dreams of a better world. the president of the general assembly, her excellency maria fernanda espinosa garces, provides us with hope and something to aspire for, as seen in this year’s theme: making the un relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. making the united nations relevant to all is a dream, yet it is a dream worth fighting for. the filipino people will remain to be persistent in our quest for peace, order, development and prosperity, and the quest for a safe and comfortable life for all filipinos. we will continue to have faith, put actions to our faith and love our neighbors. and finally, we would like to close our statement by expressing our sincere and profound gratitude to all the countries and peoples who have assisted us, stood with us and lifted us up when we needed it most. god bless you, god bless all peoples of the united nations. [end] 4","alan peter s. cayetano, secretary for foreign affairs of the philippines, said that beginning in childhood everyone is told stories that inspire a spirit of idealism that can change the world, the same idealism people feel as they enter the united nations. unfortunately, among some, idealism becomes the victim of pragmatism, morphing further into a lack of desire to try new solutions for existing problems and an unwillingness to solve problems by consensus. approaches that simply repeat what has already been done plague many at the united nations. tools like the internet and social media allow for real time communication, he continued. all people on earth are now neighbors, members of the global community. therefore, efforts are needed to promote commonalities that define all people as global citizens, as people of the united nations. he stressed there are many problems that can only be solved by a united global community. issues ranging from climate change to terrorism call for international unity and for pragmatic idealism that instills hope. migration is a reality, he asserted, urging all to “love thy neighbor”. those issues must be discussed openly, frankly and thoroughly and the global compact on migration is a huge step in the right direction, he said, thanking all parties that contributed to its formulation. migrants inspired global leaders to create the first intergovernmentally negotiated compact on the matter. under the leadership of president rodrigo duterte, the country is uncompromisingly working to promote the rule of law and to foster a just and equitable society that protects human rights. as a sovereign and democratic state, philippines is preventing its deterioration into a narco‑state. hunger for change, peace and law and order is genuine, he asserted, adding that economic reform is under way to ensure poverty does not force filipinos to seek employment abroad. the government is instituting reforms in order to protect every single citizen. when forced to choose between protecting the rights of law‑abiding filipinos or the rights of drug lords and criminals, the philippines will always defend the former. the united nations is a venue of great opportunity as long as states can transcend national interests for the good of the global community. making the united nations relevant to all is a dream worth fighting for."
Poland,"speech of the president of the republic of poland mr. andrzej duda at the general debate during the 73rd session of the un general assembly topic of the debate: making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies new york, september 26, 2018 distinguished madam president, excellencies, esteemed delegates, i congratulate ms. maría fernanda espinosa garcés, the president of the 73rd session of the un general assembly, on her election to this honorable function. i wish to assure you, madam president, about poland`s full support for the measures you will take. at the same time, i wish to express my gratitude to mr. miroslav lajčák for his active chairmanship over the 72nd session of the un general assembly. ladies and gentlemen, this year poles celebrate the centenary of regaining independence. in 1918, after 123 years of bondage, poland returned to the map of europe. the restoration of an independent, free and sovereign state became a reality mainly due to three factors: the desire of the polish nation to have its own state, 1 the heroic sacrifice of the battling soldiers, and the determination of courageous leaders, who convinced politicians across the world that without a restored poland, europe would not be just and safe. both then and today, the will of the nations and of the political leaders remains crucial. both then and today, europe will not be just and safe without sovereign poland. each september the heads of state meet here, in new york, to engage in an in-depth reflection on the most crucial issues affecting our globe. hence, it is us with whom a particular responsibility lies. it is us who are rightly expected to be courageous and active, able to rise above divisions, determined in our search for solutions to the most pressing issues of the contemporary world. ladies and gentlemen, the modern world is full of threats. we are witnessing a very dynamic development of the international situation. there are reasons to be hopeful, such as a potential change in the situation on the korean peninsula and the ongoing de-escalation of tensions there. but there are also problems that persist and remain unresolved. in order to sort them out, we undoubtedly need the cooperation of as many countries as possible today. to make it effective, two conditions need to be met. 2 firstly, we must all comply with the international law, which was the main theme of the polish presidency of the security council in may this year. i had the privilege of holding a high-level open debate at that time, the conclusions of which were that only 1) cooperation among countries within the rule-based global order will provide an opportunity to resolve frozen conflicts and prevent us from the emergence of new ones, 2) the rule-based global order requires strong institutions to enforce the international law and 3) no violation of the law can be justified or distorted by a whole range of language definitions. today the map of the world is full of flashpoints. as part of the rulebased global order that we are promoting, i would like to draw your attention to one fundamental principle that will be our priority throughout the second year of poland's membership of the security council. i am thinking of the sovereign equality of states, as referred to in article 2 of the united nations charter. if we want to be the advocates of multilateralism, and the un is, after all, its source, we must bear this principle in mind. in other words, not everyone who claims to be a proponent of multilateralism thinks of it in terms of the equality of states. one can say that there is a negative multilateralism, which boils down to the concert of powers, a division into spheres of influence and the conviction that the fate of others can be decided without their participation. europe and poland were often victims of 3 this kind of multilateralism, starting from the 18th century, throughout the 19th century, to the times of the cold war. multilateralism and the rule-based global order are there not just for the chosen ones. the same principles must apply to all and to the same extent. everyone has equal rights and proportional obligations. this is how i define the positive multilateralism, which poland stands for. the multilateralism of equal states and free nations, not the multilateralism of usurpation and hierarchy. we are committed to relations in which every state enjoys equal rights. this however does not imply a naive perception of the world, a world devoid of differences among states. what it means is that the states which have an advantage, in terms of potential and power, should not deprive others of their equal right to independence and subjectivity. only with such equality ensured, are we able to fully use the potential of states for the common good and according to the rule of fair play. this applies both to political and economic relations, since only if the principle of the equality of states is respected, are we able to talk about the exchange of interests and real alliances. however, the concept of the positive multilateralism, which poland subscribes to, goes one step further. it claims that, wherever possible, weaker countries should be given additional opportunities to make an impact, in order to make the equal rights of states more realistic. such opportunities can encompass an additional voting power, or an additional territorial representation in the 4 decision-making bodies. to me as president of the republic of poland, two areas of application of this principle are particularly close: 1) the awaited reform of the security council, which we support, and want to participate in, and which should include among its leading themes: expanding the field of equal rights and competences of all council members; 2) a reform of the european union as returning to its origins, which emerged from the concept of positive multilateralism, and which today are repeatedly violated. next year poland will organize a series of initiatives centered around the idea of sovereign equality. the aim of that effort is to win over as many supporters of our vision as possible. secondly, it is important that multilateralism serves a certain system of values, instead of being just an element of a political technology and a game of interests. such system of values is reflected in the charter of the united nations. negative multilateralism, which contravenes these values, may only result in the exacerbation of global problems. on the other hand, a voluntary cooperation of states, equal in their rights, can bring lasting peace to europe and the world. every time a temptation of a concert of powers is born, the global stability is undermined. contributes whoever to the promotes disintegration negative multilateralism of global the order. multilateralism is meant to be a commitment to respect for 5 values, especially the fundamental ones, such as respect for human dignity and life. it is about the values which go beyond the political order and are not politically defined, for they are the foundation of the global political order. ladies and gentlemen, international relations do not serve states only, they serve the entire humanity. therefore, sovereignty of a state should be fundamentally linked to responsibility for the respect of norms which are common for the good of us all. every violation of the norms must bear consequences. wherever leaders might infringe fundamental human rights, use tortures, persecute their political opponents or use weapons of mass destruction, the international community, including the security council, should respond swiftly and decisively. being a nation with a unique experience of a peaceful democratic transformation and a struggle for fundamental freedoms, poland attaches particular importance to protection and promotion of human rights, as exemplified, among others, by my country`s bid for membership in the un human rights council, for the 2020-2022 term. our potential membership in this body, unique for the global human rights protection system, will complement, in a natural way, our current membership in the security council, in accordance with the fundamental un triad of peace and security, human rights and development. 6 ladies and gentlemen, the un charter endows the organization, and especially its security council, with special responsibility for matters pertaining to peace and international security. as a non-permanent member of the security council we deem this task to be of crucial importance. poland actively supports all actions and initiatives aimed at preventing the use and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, as well as bringing the perpetrators using such weapons to justice. i wish to announce that poland intends to return to an active participation in the un peace-keeping missions. we have submitted a formal application to the secretariat in this regard and are looking forward to its positive evaluation. given our experience in this field, extending over many years, we are convinced that it will positively contribute to the peaceful resolution of conflicts. poland is involved in the process of stabilization and building of lasting security on the korean peninsula, not only now, in its capacity as non-permanent member of the un security council, but also as a member of the neutral nations supervisory commission in korea. i am convinced that the nnsc experience could potentially be applied while establishing foundations for peace and stability on the peninsula. 7 given its extensive experience accumulated during the period of political transformation, poland stands ready to get actively engaged in the international peace rebuilding and consolidation programs in the middle east. in all the places where, after the end of conflicts, it is necessary to restore stability and provide development opportunities. at the same time, poland regards it as its duty to draw the attention of the international community to the sources of threats to world peace resulting from frozen conflicts, occupation and shifting of borders by force, which is happening in eastern europe. international community must not allow a return to “business as usual”, and the actions of the aggressors should be confronted with a relevant response. ladies and gentlemen, this december poland will have an honor to host the 24th session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (cop 24), in the city of katowice. the primary goal of the meeting is to finalize works on the provisions implementing the paris agreement. a complete and effective implementation of the paris agreement is inextricably connected with the attainment of the un sustainable development goals. therefore, the global climate action should 8 bring together the economic, social and environmental dimensions, while at the same time, be conducive to stopping the global warming and eradicating the most serious problems of the modern world. the implementation package, planned to be adopted in katowice, provides an essential basis for action to be taken by state entities and ngos, including international financial institutions, the private sector, local authorities and civil society organizations. only provisions applicable in the long-term and accepted by all actors, are able to guarantee and sustainability of rules, implementation of the transparency, legal security, which is indispensable for the adopted obligations and for the strengthening of global ambitions. cop 24 will be launched with the leaders` summit, which is scheduled for december 3rd and 4th, and offers an excellent opportunity to express our common and responsible political will. it will also send a clear messege to the world that the efforts we make are aimed at securing a safe future. once again, i wish to invite you to attend the katowice summit and ensure a highturn out for the event. 9 ladies and gentlemen, the centenary of poland regaining independence makes us reflect on the fate of the world, europe and on my country`s difficult road to freedom. simultaneously, it is a reason to look into the future and an inspiration to sensibly shape our common, international reality based on historical experiences, values and aspirations. i encourage all member states to work even closer together on the initiatives aimed at achieving the objectives which guide the united nations organization. only the decisions taken jointly by political leaders are able to address challenges faced by the globalized world. poland subscribes to the view that our common future requires a strong and effective international community, which will better accommodate the needs of humanity. this however is going to depend mainly on us, since the united nations organization is not an abstract entity, it is the common achievement of us all. it is up to us how effective we will be in using it for the sake of building peace, ensuring justice and sustainable development, in other words: building a better world, worthy of the 21st century – for us, but first and foremost, for the future generations. thank you very much for your attention. 10","andrzej duda, president of poland, noted that his people are celebrating the centenary of regaining independence, stating europe will not be just and safe without a sovereign poland. elsewhere, he said, the modern world is full of threats, but dynamic developments on the international situation offer reasons to be hopeful, such as ongoing de-escalation of tensions on the korean peninsula. however, problems remain unresolved, and require the cooperation of as many countries as possible. only cooperation among countries within the rule-based global order can resolve frozen conflicts and prevent the emergence of new ones, he said. adding that such order requires strong institutions to enforce it, he said no violation of the law can be justified. stating that the sovereign equality of states as referred to in article 2 of the united nations charter would be poland’s priority in its second year of membership on the security council, he pointed to a “negative multiculturalism” that aims for the concert of powers, division into spheres of influence and deciding the fate of others. “europe and poland were often the victims of this kind of multiculturalism” he said, calling for the multiculturalism of equal states and free nations, not of usurpation and hierarchy. states with an advantage of potential and power should not deprive others of their equal right to independence, he continued. saying weaker countries should be given enhanced opportunities that may involve additional voting powers or representation in decision-making bodies, he called for reform of the security council to expand the field of equal rights, and reform of the european union to its origins, which “emerged from the concept of positive multiculturalism, and which today are repeatedly violated”. multilateralism must serve the system of values reflected in the united nations charter, he said, because when there is a temptation to a concert of powers, global stability is undermined. the sovereignty of a state should be fundamentally linked to responsibility for the respect of norms for the common good. he stated poland attaches particular importance to human rights, bidding for membership in the united nations human rights council for 2020-2022, and will return to active participation in peacekeeping missions. poland is involved in the process of stabilization and building lasting security on the korean peninsula and is ready to actively engage in international peace rebuilding in the middle east. however, he felt the duty to alert the international community of threats to world peace resulting from frozen conflicts, occupation and shifting of borders by force, which is happening in eastern europe. “the international community must not allow a return to “business as usual”, and the actions of aggressors should be confronted with a relevant response” he said."
Portugal,"portugal address by his excellency the president of the portuguese republic united nations ge eral ssembly new york, 26 september 2018 madam president mr. secretary-general, adam president, maria fernanda esp nosa, very special congratulations on your election. because of your personality and career. because of the priorities you have defined. because of the progress you represent in gender equality at the united nations. because of the previous informal interactive dialog, a sign of increased transparency of the general assembly. mr. secretary-general, antonio guterres, equal congratulation and continued support to all the priorities you have pursued and all the actions you have developed during your lucid and dynamic mandate. multilateralism, based on international law and the charter of the united nations, the reform of the united ations system, conflict prevention, peacekeeping and the maintenance of peace, concern about migration and refugees, combating terrorism and international crime, the oceans and maritime security, climate change, the agenda 2030, gender equality and support to young people. all directed towards the permanent u holding of human rights. strengthened multilateralism, always. for this reason, we do not understand, rather we deplore, unilateral tropism and disinvestment in international organizations. they represent a political short¬ sightedness, which runs the risk of repeating the mistakes of almost a century ago. the reform of the united nations requires the commitment of all member states. mainta ning the status quo is a way of gutting multilateralism and multiplying risks, conflicts without prevention, underdevelopment and the violation of human rights and human dignity. not reforming the security council with a broad-based consensus is to ignore the geopolitics of the 21st century, which requires, at the very least, the presence of the african continent, brazil and india. preventing conflicts and maintaining peace in peacekeeping and institutional capacity building operations, as portugal is doing in nine united nations operations; six of them in africa, i would especially mention our presence in minusca and in minusma, in the multinational rotation contribution. migration and refugees, which involves understanding the causes of gro ing human mobility, the need for d alogue between societ es of origin, transit and destination, the global compact for safe, orderly and re ular migration and the global compact for refugees"", and promotion of the right to education in emergency situations. portugal unreser edly supports these ""pacts"", it accepts and will continue to accept migrants, refugees and other displaced persons. it launched - under former president jorge sampaio - the global platform for syrian students"" and calls for wider involvement in the rapid response mechanism for higher education"". the fight aga nst terrorism, which has led to the creation of the un office of counter-terrorism , the ""lst conference of heads of counter-terrorism agencies , and the sixth revision of the un global counter-terrorism strategy"". the guarantee of justice for victims of serious international crimes through the international criminal court, which began to consider the crime of aggression in 2017 - a step in which portugal played an active role - and is expected to move towards universal adoption with the accession of more member states. oceans and maritime security, meaning multilateralism and international law. portugal is actively involved in the preparations for the ""second united nat ons oceans conference"" in 2020, and stands ready to assume all the responsibilities that are in olved in its organization. maritime security in places such as the coasts of somalia or the gulf of guinea, where portugal is present in the eunavfor atalanta operation within the framework of the european union, and in the yaounde process alongside the african •union and countries in the region. and we are going further, creating in the azores a center for the defense of the ocean, a platform for the different international organ sations. global governance of the oceans, with the united nations framewor convention on climate change"" and the ""global compact for the environment"". for us, these are structural issues which we do not change to suit short-term trends and players - we regard the right to a healthy environment as a fundamental right. we support carbon neutrality by 2050, and with lebanon e are jointly chairing the working party on the global compact for the environment . basically, there are two different views of the world. one, short-term, is unilateral or minilateral, protectionist, with domestic populist discourse, minimizing mult lateralism in anything to do with sustainable development, prone to climate change denial, opposed to global pacts on migration and refugees, only interested in conflict prevention and peacekeeping where and when, occasionally, it matters to it, and matters more in terms of economic rather than political power. the other, opposing, view, which we share, is ultilateral, open, and favorable to the search for global governance, committed to sustainable development, regarding international law, the charter and human rights as values and principles, never as means or conveniences. and e are confident that, in the medium to longterm, this view will prevail, as it has prevailed in the european union, which has given europe the longest period of peace in living memory and the highest levels of welfare and social protection. and also the 70th anniversary of the declaration of human rights and the international law commission. this is the appropriate time to call for consensus on the adoption of the biennial resolution on the moratorium on the death penalty"", which is to be submitted to this general assembly. mada president, mr. secretary-general, our view of the world situation and of the role of the united nations - which, as i said, is in complete agreement ith that of the secretary-general explains our positions on so-called regional questions, but which are global in scope. let me now dwell on some that are of special relevance to portugal. the strengthening of the community of portuguese speaking countries, currently presided by cabo verde, to be followed by angola, whose contributions to stability and development i wish to highlight. the cplp enjoys magnificent cooperation with the un and pursues.the goal of seeing the portuguese language - one of the most widely spoken in the world - adopted as an official language of the united nations. the steps taken in guinea-bissau in preparation for elections in november. the growing importance of the african union its key uniting role for peace and sustainable development, the intensification of the partnership with the united nations and the historic step of the joint declaration of peace and friendship between ethiopia and eritrea. our wish that the elections in the democratic republic of congo ill be held in a safe, free and fair manner and that the results will be respected by all. the important developments on the korean peninsula opening up positive prospects for complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation and demonstrating the commitment and courage of the parties involved and the contribution of the regional partners of the united nations and of diplomacy for world peace and security. the signing of the maritime boundary treaty between australia and timor-leste under the auspices of the secretary-general of the united nations, confirming the effect veness of the peaceful settlement of disputes through conciliation under the united nations convention on the law of the sea"". unfortunately, certain parts of the middle east and the maghreb continue to show signs of permanent political, social and economic instability. in libya the international community must unite to assist with the humanitarian and security situation and the creation of a solid state. yemen remains the scene of one of the greatest humanitarian crises today, affecting especially the most vulnerable, women and children. only negotiated political solutions, through the mediation of the unite nations and respect for international humanitarian law, will be able to reverse this increasingly tragic situation. equally tragic is the humanitarian crisis in syria, with one of the largest flows of refugees within and out of the region. here also, only a substantive, inclusive and un-mediated political solution will tend to ensure effective and broad-based international support for reconstruction, in the absence of which there will be apparent, sporadic and transitory agreements, but not the lasting peace. in any case, stabilization and peace in the middle east will only be possible with the resolution of the israeli-paiestinian conflict. common sense demands the resumption of a credible negotiation process, addressing all the final status issues, including the question of jerusalem, and leading to a practicable two-state solution based on coexistence by israel and palestine in peace and security. madam president, mr. secretary-general, as mentioned yesterday by secretary-general antonio guterres, true patriotism is only complete with cosmopolitanism. portugal believes that mult lateral action, political dialog and diplomatic wisdom are the only possible route to harmonious coexistence between nations and peoples. and that a very short-term vie or iews, ho e er appealing they may appear to be, are just a flash in the pan, which does not last, will not last, and will not solve the world s true problems: development, justice, security and effective respect for the rights of those who are the reason for our mandate and our presence in this general assembly. as nelson mandela said: a fundamental concern for others in our indi dual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of . this is the noble mission of this institution; it is also the reason for portugal s deep commitment to the united nations. thank you.","marcelo rebelo de sousa, president of portugal, deplored the emergence of unilateral tropism and disinvestment in international organizations, saying that political short-sightedness runs the risk of repeating the mistakes of almost a century ago. multilateralism must always be strengthened but will be gutted if the status quo is maintained. the geopolitics of the twenty‑first century require reforming the security council, at the very least adding the presence of the african continent, brazil and india. in conflict prevention and peacekeeping, he cited portugal’s role in nine united nations operations, particularly the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic (minusca) and the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali (minusma). portugal also unreservedly supports the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and the global compact on refugees, and will continue to accept migrants, refugees and other displaced persons. he pointed to the global platform for syrian students, launched under former portugal president jorge sampaio. he said that multilateralism affects oceans and maritime security, and he mentioned portugal’s preparations for the second united nations oceans conference in 2020. his country is also involved in the european union naval force operation working for maritime security on the coasts of somalia and the gulf of guinea, and the yaoundé process alongside the african union, and is going further in creating the azores center for the defense of the ocean, an international platform. he said there are two different views of the world. one is short‑term, unilateral, protectionist, minimizing multilateralism and prone to climate change denial, opposing global pacts on migration and refugees. portugal, he said, shares the other, multilateral view, which is open, favors global governance, is committed to sustainable development, and regards international law and human rights as values and principles. this view, he said, will prevail as it has in the european union, which is enjoying the longest period of peace in living memory. turning to the world situation, he attached special relevance to strengthening the community of portuguese speaking countries, currently presided over by cabo verde. saying portuguese is among the world’s most widely spoken languages, he called for its adoption as an official language of the united nations. noting the growing importance of the african union in peace and sustainable development, he hailed the historic joint declaration of peace and friendship between ethiopia and eritrea and expressed hope for safe, free and fair elections in the congo. important developments on the korean peninsula open up positive prospects for denuclearization. unfortunately, he said, parts of the middle east and maghreb remain unstable, citing libya, yemen and syria as crises that require international action and a substantive, inclusive and united nations–mediated political solution. “in any case, stabilization and peace in the middle east will only be possible with the resolution of the israeli‑palestinian conflict,” he said, noting it requires the resumption of a credible negotiation process addressing all final issues, including the question of jerusalem."
President of the General Assembly (closing),,"maría fernanda espinosa garcés (ecuador), president of the general assembly, said this year’s general debate underscored the ongoing relevance of the assembly and of the united nations as a whole. it also set the tone for the assembly’s work for the coming year. everyone can honestly say that the past six days of member states’ interventions wrapped up on a high note, with the satisfaction of a job well done. summarizing the general debate, she spotlighted the emphasis given to the role of the organization and the importance of multilateralism. there was almost unanimous agreement, along with repeated appeals for strengthened multilateralism, on the irreplaceability of the united nations. she noted the adoption of political declarations on eradicating tuberculosis and combatting non‑communicable diseases, as well as the signature by seven countries and the ratification by four of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. leaders also shared progress being made in their countries as well as challenges being faced, in sustainable development, peacebuilding and respect for human rights. all the statements, put together, add up to a snapshot of the state of the world today and of the role that befalls the united nations in its aims towards multilateralism, she said, thanking the 121 heads of state and government, the nine vice‑presidents and deputy prime ministers, and the other ministers and representatives who participated. it was heartening to see many countries defend multilateralism, she said, adding that sustainable development and the threat of climate change were the topics most often mentioned. she also observed that several leaders noted 2018 as the seventieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, underscored the importance of gender equality, voiced support for the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and called for greater investment in conflict prevention. “we need to make a difference,” she stressed, “and the time to do that is now.”"
President of the General Assembly (opening),"un i t e d n a t i o n s nations unies the president of the united nations general assembly opening of the general debate [as delivered] 25 september 2018 heads of state and government, distinguished ministers, excellencies, mr. secretary-general, madam deputy secretary-general, it is an honor to welcome you to the seventy-third session of the united nations general assembly. i welcome you to the only place where a meeting such as this is possible. only this assembly, as the main deliberative and representative body of the united nations, offers an opportunity to all the world’s peoples and leaders to listen and to be heard on an equal basis. excellencies, the united nations has made an enormous contribution to humanity. international law, the promotion of peace, human rights, environmental protection standards, goals for sustainable development and the main components that regulate global co-existence all originated in this very assembly. the work of the united nations continues to be as relevant today as it was 73 years ago. multilateralism is the only possible response to the global challenges we face. to weaken it or call it into question would only create instability, confusion, mistrust and polarization. millions of people around the world are enduring violence, war, material shortages and the effects of climate change. uncertainty and fear are a daily reality for these millions of human beings. inequality has deprived many societies of hope and opportunities. the absence of dreams and a meaning in the future is being used to divide our communities, intensifying racism, xenophobia and violence, all of which represents the exact opposite of the charter we adopted in 1945. excellencies, no one can be indifferent to human suffering. wars, conflicts, economic crises and environmental degradation affect us all equally. we live in an interconnected world that compels us to sustain global dialog and the multilateral response. for that reason, i have proposed that we take up the multilateral agenda with a renewed commitment based on three principles: global leadership, shared responsibility and collective action. global leadership is aimed at identifying common solutions to global problems and taking appropriate and timely decisions. shared responsibility, because we all share a common commitment to safeguard social cohesion and human dignity, and the health of the planet. collective action, because the most critical problems of humanity concern us all. i invite you to take inspiration in the age-old andean principle of “minga”, which refers to a collective effort and shared work that is carried out for the benefit of the community. let us therefore create a “global minga” to build societies that are more egalitarian, peaceful, sustainable and resilient. this year, i call on you to work together on seven priorities. the first priority of this assembly will be gender equality and the empowerment of women, which is an ongoing debt owed to over half of the world’s population that is holding back global development. achieving women’s economic and productive inclusion could increase world gross domestic product by 11 per cent by 2025. regrettably, violence against women continues to be found in every region. girls and adolescents still lack sufficient access to good-quality information and education, which help to reduce inequalities. the second priority is the implementation of the new global compacts on migration and refugees, which will benefit around 260 million migrants and 25 million refugees who have been displaced by conflict and violence. the creation of decent work opportunities for all is the third priority, since this is one of the most important challenges of public policy in terms of the development and sustainability of social security systems. fourthly, we will work to give greater attention to environmental protection and to make progress on the agreements aimed at slowing climate change. heatwaves, forest fires, storms and floods are leaving behind a trail of death and destruction. in august, the state of kerala in india suffered its worst monsoon flood in recent history, which killed 400 people and displaced a million more from their homes. hurricanes killed thousands of people in 2017, making them one of the deadliest extreme climate disasters in history. we have a responsibility to slow the production and consumption policies and habits that are destroying our planet. i have proposed to highlight the problem of plastic pollution as a widespread environmental threat that affects the health and well-being of everyone in the world. the great pacific garbage patch is more than four times the size of germany and three times the size of france, and it represents a latent threat to the pacific coast of the united states. the fifth priority relates to the importance of deepening the political and social commitment to persons with disabilities. greater awareness is still needed of their specific needs. accessibility, inclusive and good-quality education and decent jobs are all challenges faced by the largest minority. the sixth priority is the revitalization of the united nations, and here we will work on three areas: implementing the reforms of the system; strengthening the revitalization of the general assembly, to optimize its working methods and enhance its deliberative and decision-making role; and continuing to reform the security council on the basis of the will and commitment of the states. the seventh priority will be peace and security and the role of young people in conflict prevention. the assembly should become the main peacebuilding organ, through a preventive approach. sustainable peace should be rooted in dialog and understanding. facilitating this dialog will be my priority. the general assembly should drive efforts to ensure that young people have greater opportunities and political participation, to avoid situations that lead inexorably to violent extremism. peace and security is one of the central pillars of the work of this organization. the most acute conflicts and disagreements are settled through dialog, rapprochement, generosity and mutual understanding, even when there are cultural and religious differences. in recent months, some of you have taken significant steps towards peace and understanding, which is inspiring and deserves recognition from us all. in july, the president of eritrea and the prime minister of ethiopia signed a joint declaration of peace and friendship to put an end to decades of conflict between the two countries. the state of war has ended and diplomatic relations, transport, trade and communications are being re-established. similarly, in april, the panmunjom declaration for peace, prosperity and unification of the korean peninsula was adopted between the republic of korea and the democratic people’s republic of korea. both nations agreed to work together to put an end to decades of war and conflict. this represents a historic milestone on the path to a new era of peace and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula. both events give us hope in a world where many conflicts are still awaiting a peaceful solution. the challenges addressed in the charter of the united nations have evolved. the threats of climate change, the erosion of biodiversity, human trafficking, environmental pollution, large displacements of both migrants and refugees, terrorism and ethnic conflicts are now at the top of our agenda. we have entered a technological and digital era that is fostering economic, social and cultural exchanges that were unimaginable only a few decades ago. this organization needs to be better prepared to deal with these challenges. this is why we must make progress in implementing the reforms of the united nations system. we want an organization that is more efficient and responsive and that reflects the political and economic reality of a changing world. the leadership and commitment of the states and the secretary-general, his excellency antónio guterres, inspire us to take decisive steps forward in this respect. we must maintain our vision and commitment regarding implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, as this is the only way to ensure that everyone can live in dignity and in peace. i invite us all to pay particular attention to the vulnerabilities of countries in special situations and the efforts they must make to achieve the sustainable development goals. small island states, landlocked countries and least developed countries require that we share responsibility for the achievement of these goals. excellencies, i confirm my commitment to africa and its peoples. let us devote our best efforts to accelerating the implementation of development programs in africa. let us act with africa as well as talk about africa. one of the remaining challenges facing this organization is to achieve a permanent and lasting peace in the middle east, by aiming to implement the resolutions adopted by this assembly. excellencies, this year, we commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights. the fight for human rights remains a challenge in the world. seventy years ago, a great woman led the work of the human rights commission in charge of drafting the universal declaration, mrs. eleanor roosevelt. one of her phrases illustrates, in a simple way, why we must work to bring this organization and its decisions closer to our peoples. mrs. roosevelt pointed out, and i quote: “where, after all, do universal human rights begin? in small places, close to home – so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm or office where he works. such are the places where every man, woman and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. without concerned citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.” end of quote. i would like to inaugurate the seventy-third session of the general assembly with an effusive call to world leaders to meet the needs of our peoples and not to lose heart in their efforts to build a more peaceful, more secure and more human world order, where everyone can find their place with dignity. let us therefore build a united nations that is more relevant to all. thank you. *****","maría fernanda espinosa garcés (ecuador), president of the general assembly, said that the work of the united nations is as relevant today as it was 73 years ago. multilateralism stands alone as the only viable response to the problems facing the international community. around the world, millions of people are suffering from violence, war, want and the effects of climate change. for those millions, uncertainty and fear are their daily lot. their crushed dreams and lack of any hope in the future is exploited by some to further divide communities, stirring up racism, xenophobia and violence. “no one can be indifferent to human suffering. wars, conflicts, economic crises and environmental degradation affect us all equally”, she stated. she called for member states to work together around seven priorities, the first being gender equality and the empowerment of women. violence against women persists in all regions of the world and girls are still not offered full access to quality education. the second priority should be the implementation of the new global agreements on refugees and migrants. the creation of decent work opportunities for all is the third priority and represents one of the most significant challenges for public policymaking. regarding the fourth priority, she stressed that attention should be paid to the protection to the environment. extreme heat waves, forest fires and storms and floods are leaving in their wake a trail of death and devastation and hurricanes killed thousands of people in 2017. the international community bears the responsibility to reverse policies that are killing the planet. turning to the fifth priority, she called for member states to firm up political commitments to persons with disabilities. accessibility, inclusive and quality education and dignified jobs are all challenges for persons with disabilities. the sixth priority is the revitalization of the united nations, including the reform process of the security council. the seventh priority is peace and security, as well as the role of young people, she continued. the general assembly must be the chief peacebuilding organization in the world. it must champion initiatives to ensure that young people enjoy greater participation in political activities. concluding, she pointed out that the challenges addressed in the united nations charter have evolved. the threats of climate change, the erosion of biodiversity, human trafficking, environmental pollution, large displacements of both migrants and refugees, terrorism and ethnic conflicts are now at the top of the agenda. she appealed to world leaders to meet the needs of the people, and not to lose heart in attempts to create a more peaceful and humane world."
Qatar,,"sheik tamim bin hamad al-thani, emir of qatar, said the world faces challenges that cross boundaries and must be dealt with according to international law and without double standards. to those ends, he called for the reform of the united nations. the illegal blockade imposed on qatar was the result of a pre‑arranged campaign, based on fabrication. despite the challenges that blockade created, his country experienced a strengthening of status and consolidation of its role as an active partner in regional and international arenas. he expressed appreciation for the assistance of friendly nations in ending the crisis, adding that differences in views on regional issues should not paralyze the effectiveness of important regional organizations like the gulf cooperation council, as it harms their international reputation. little progress has been made on lingering issues in the middle east, he said, citing the political stalemate in palestine. the deterioration of the situation in the palestinian territories lays a historic responsibility on the security council, he said, reaffirming the importance of negotiations and emphasizing the commitment to the resolutions of international legitimacy, including the two-state solution and the arab peace initiative. his country will continue to provide material and political support to the palestinian people. regarding the ongoing crisis in syria, he said the failure to deter that country’s regime from committing crimes will render the provisions of international and human rights law devoid of any meaning and will further raise the existing ceiling on the use of violence against people in his region. the humanitarian, moral and legal catastrophe in that country requires the international community to double its efforts to find a peaceful solution. regarding the situation in yemen, he called on all parties to end the conflict based on security council resolution 2216 (2015). advocating for free access for humanitarian assistance in all areas in yemen, he announced qatar’s agreement with the united nations to fight cholera in yemen by supporting projects addressing the disease there. regarding the libyan crisis, he said the security and territorial integrity of the country were at stake. foreign intervention in libyan affairs only complicates the crisis and contradicts security council resolutions. in iraq, he praised the efforts of the government to restore stability and national reconciliation in its fight against terrorism. terrorism has become one of the world’s outstanding challenges, he said, affirming his country’s prioritizing of the issue on every level. in order to achieve success in the war on terrorism, four prerequisites must be met. first, there must be international cooperation in combatting violence resulting from extremism and violence against civilians. second, standards of fighting terrorism must be unified so that there is a universal definition not dependent on religion or ethnicity. third, the roots and causes of terrorism must be addressed in the political, social and cultural spheres. lastly, it is crucial to avoid giving partisan connotation to the term “terrorist”. educating youth is the first line of defense for the collective security system and crucial in fighting terrorism. to that end, his country, in collaboration with the united nations, has committed to educating 10 million children and providing economic empowerment to half a million young people. highlighting the importance of the protection of human rights in qatar, he said his country had recently passed a law regulating political asylum in the country and has invited several international human rights organizations to establish regional offices there. in conclusion, he emphasized the need for freedom of access in the cybersphere and the need to protect citizens against hacking and the importance of national cybersecurity."
Republic of Korea,"address by president moon jae-in of the republic of korea at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly september 26, 2018 madam president, mr. secretary-general and distinguished delegates, i would like to express my deepest condolences on the passing of kofi annan, the 7th secretary-general of the united nations. the world will forever remember his name that has been etched in the road to peace. i would like to congratulate ms. maria espinosa, on assuming the presidency of the general assembly. i hope the united nations will be able to reach out to every corner of the globe through the 73rd session of the general assembly. i also hope that the united nations will make further progress in contributing to the international community under secretary-general antonio guterres’s excellent leadership. as i had done last year, i stand here once again with a sense of urgency and excitement. over the past year, something miraculous has taken place on the korean peninsula. for the first time in history, the leader of north korea crossed the military demarcation line to visit panmunjeom. a historic summit between the united states and north korea was also held on the sentosa island in singapore. chairman kim jong un and i removed the shadow of war and resolved to usher in an era of peace and prosperity. at the u.s-north korea summit, the two sides agreed to work towards achieving complete denuclearization on the korean peninsula, ending hostile relations and establishing a permanent peace regime. president trump and chairman kim moved and gave hope to those who desire peace all around the world. north korea dismantled its nuclear test site in punggye-ri under the observation of the international community. the united states and the republic of korea suspended large-scale joint military exercises and built trust. 1 i would like to thank and salute president trump and chairman kim’s courage and resolve as they usher in a new era on the korean peninsula as well as in u.s-north korea relations. last week in pyongyang, i met chairman kim for the third time and reached an agreement once again to turn the korean peninsula into a land of peace free from nuclear weapons and threats. chairman kim expressed his hope of completing denuclearization as soon as possible to focus on economic development. moreover, chairman kim expressed his commitment to permanently dismantle the missile engine test site and launch platform in dongchang-ri under observation of the international community as a first step, in order to expedite progress in denuclearization. furthermore, he expressed his firm willingness to continue to take additional denuclearization measures including the permanent dismantlement of nuclear facilities in yongbyon as the united states takes corresponding measures in the spirit of the sentosa agreement. the korean peninsula has remained under the armistice over the past 65 years. ending the korean war is an urgent task. it is a process that we must go through in order to move towards a peace regime. i look forward to seeing bold measures for denuclearization implemented among the related countries, leading to the declaration to end the war. regardless of the challenges that lie ahead, the leaders of the south, the north and the united states will move step by step towards peace based on mutual trust. such a dramatic change has been possible thanks to the support and encouragement of the people around the world who desire peace. in particular, the united nations gave north korea the courage to embark on the road to peace. i would like to express my gratitude to the united nations for its role. this is, however, just the beginning. i would like to ask for continued support and cooperation from the member states on our journey towards complete denuclearization and permanent peace. the republic of korea will spare no effort to encourage north korea’s participation in the international community while adhering to the resolutions adopted by the united nations. . 2 madam president, last winter, a prelude to peace on the korean peninsula unfolded in pyeongchang in gangwon province. it was the moment when the olympic truce resolution adopted at the un general assembly in november 2017 came to precious fruition. secretary-general guterres and many heads of state extended their congratulations on the participation of north korean athletes and officials in the pyeongchang olympic winter games. they expressed their wishes for unity and peace on the korean peninsula. the world was awakened to the sense of new history of peace being written. i would like to thank thomas bach, president of the international olympic committee, for paving the way for north korea’s participation in the winter olympics. just over a month after the close of the pyeongchang paralympic winter games, chairman kim and i met for the first time in panmunjeom. the united nations welcomed and actively supported the adoption of the panmunjeom declaration. by doing so, it provided tremendous strength to the meetings that have followed, including the second inter-korean summit, the u.s.-north korea summit and the recent inter-korean summit in pyongyang. at the 72nd session of the un general assembly, i expressed the hope that north korea will choose peace on its own accord in order to establish sound and sustainable peace. this hope was shared by the united nations and all of the international community. north korea responded positively to our hopes and calls. chairman kim changed the direction of the political situation on the korean peninsula through his new year’s address on the first day of this year. the participation of north korea’s athletes and delegation in the pyeongchang winter olympics provided a decisive momentum to break the impasse in building peace. on april 20, north korea officially ended its policy of nuclear development and has since devoted all of its efforts towards economic development. on september 9, in the ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of its foundation, north korea expressed its commitment to peace and prosperity instead of boasting its nuclear capabilities. north korea moved out of longstanding isolation on its own initiative and stands before the international community once again. 3 now, it is the international community’s turn to respond positively to north korea’s new choice and efforts. we must assure chairman kim that he has made the right decision in committing to denuclearization. we must encourage north korea to stay on the path that leads to permanent and solid peace. the role of the united nations is crucial. the un secretariat has continued its efforts for dialog and engagement, including the invitation of north korean officials to international conferences. the united nations has stated its commitment to “leave no one behind.” my sincere hope is that the un’s vision of sustainable development will be realized on the korean peninsula. i have no doubt that if the international community paves the way, north korea will not stall on making strides towards peace and prosperity. the republic of korea will spare no effort to guide north korea towards that path. i would like to call on the united nations to share its experience and wisdom. madam president, the process of working towards denuclearization and establishing peace on the korean peninsula is a process that also leads to building peace and cooperation in northeast asia. northeast asia is home to one-fifth of the world’s population, and it accounts for a quarter of the global economy. however, regional conflicts stand in the way of pursuing broader cooperation. we will begin the work of resolving conflicts in northeast asia starting from the korean peninsula. on august 15, i proposed the creation of an east asian railroad community, which would involve six northeast asian countries and the united states. the european coal and steel community, which gave birth to the creation of the european union, is a living example of what this kind of initiative could achieve. i believe that the east asian railroad community will be able to serve as a starting point for the creation of an energy and economic community in east asia, and going a step further, lead to a multilateral peace and security architecture in northeast asia. 4 the two koreas are working to reconnect railroads and roads that had been disconnected. going forward, the republic of korea will be engaging in close consultations with countries in the region on concrete steps towards the east asian railroad community. as we work to realize the un spirit of multilateralism and pave the way for a future of shared prosperity, i would like to ask for the support and cooperation of the international community. madam president, the republic of korea, together with the united nations, has weathered the storms of modern history. the united nations and the republic of korea share common values and philosophies. this month, the government of the republic of korea announced its vision of an “inclusive nation” based on a people-centered governing philosophy. we are moving towards a fair and just nation as well as a society in which no one is discriminated against and everyone lives in harmony. “inclusiveness” is also a philosophy embedded in international development cooperation. the government of the republic of korea will steadily expand its contribution to development cooperation to create a global community that leaves no one behind. the republic of korea is also increasing its assistance to people who are suffering from human rights violations and discrimination, particularly the most vulnerable groups, including children, youths, women and those with disabilities. we increased our financial aid for refugees five times in the past five years. starting from this year, korea is providing 50,000 tons of rice every year to developing countries that are suffering from severe food crises. i believe that there needs to be a holistic approach encompassing peace, development and human rights to fundamentally resolve humanitarian crises. the government of the republic of korea will engage in discussions and provide support to “make the united nations relevant to all people.” 5 this year marks the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights. anyone who has confronted the abuse of power to advance human rights carries in his or her heart the first clause of the declaration, “all human beings are born free and equal.” in particular, i am working to realize gender equality in a tangible way as an important part of our administrative agendas. all forms of discrimination and violence against women are being dealt with even more sternly. korea has a firsthand experience of “comfort women”, who were victims of suffering inflicted by the japanese military. we will actively participate in discussions among the international community over women, peace and security. we will also work together with the international community on the efforts to eradicate sexual violence in conflict. responding to climate change and transitioning to a low-carbon economy are challenges and tasks facing our generation. the government of the republic of korea will raise its share of renewable energy in the nation’s total power generation to 20 percent by 2030. we will faithfully implement the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in compliance with the paris agreement and assist developing countries’ pursuit of sustainable development by supporting them with climate change responses. madam president, mr. secretary-general and distinguished delegates, for the two koreas, the significance of the united nations goes beyond any international organization. at the 46th un general assembly on september 17, 1991, all of its 159 member states unanimously adopted the resolution for joint accession by south and north korea to the united nations. that date was coincidentally world peace day. the representatives of south and north korea pledged in their respective speeches that although south and north korea started as separate members, they would eventually become one someday through reconciliation, cooperation and peace. 6 now, after 27 years have passed, south and north korea are realizing the pledge made on that day. we have crossed the barriers of division and are tearing down the walls in our heart. we are proving to the international community that when we come together, we have sufficient means to establish peace. ladies and gentlemen, we all desire peace. peace represents the relatives and neighbors we love, and the hometowns we long for. peace means sharing what we have together. a peace we have all achieved together is a peace for all. i’m confident that all of you will always be with us on the path to permanent peace and denuclearization on the korean peninsula as well as on the journey to a peaceful world. thank you. 7","moon jae-in, president of the republic of korea, declared that “something

Republic of Moldova,"republic of moldova statement by h.e. mr. pavel filip prime minister of the republic of moldova at the general debate of the seventy-third session of the un general assembly new york, 28 september 2018 madame president, mister secretary-general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to begin by congratulating h.e. ms. maria fernanda espinosa on her election as president of the seventy-third session of the un general assembly and to wish her success in fulfilling her important mandate. furthermore, i would like to thank h.e. mr. miroslav lajcak for the fruitful activity in his capacity as president of the general assembly during the previous session and to wish him success in his future endeavors. i take this opportunity to pay tribute to the former un secretary-general, h.e. mr. kofi annan, a true leader and promoter of un values, who will remain in the memory of this or anization as one of the most distinguished and dedicated supporters of humanitarianism and global peace. madame president, for more than 70 years, the united nations is the center of multilateral diplomacy, playing a primary role in global processes, from international peace and security to the promotion human rights and sustainable development. while the international environment is continually evolving and transforming, now it is a crucial moment requiring the adaptation of the united nations to face the challenges of the modern world. hence, we welcome the initiatives of the secretary-general, antonio guterres, which he launched since the first day of his taking office. in particular, we welcome the reform to enhance the performance of the un secretariat in the field of inte ational peace and security by highlighting conflict prevention as a top riority. furthermore, we support the efforts for the management reform, through the optimization of functions and increasing the accountability of all the branches of the secretariat in the fulfillment of their mandate. finally, of particular importance is the recent decision on the repositioning of the un development system, by enabling it to effectively contribute to the implementation of sustainable development goals agreed three years ago. undoubtedly, these initiatives are very complex and will carry systemic changes across the entire organization. to ensure that these reforms yield the expected results in a medium and long term perspective, the transparent and constructive dialog between un management and member states will have to be sustained. 2 madame president, the implementation of agenda 2030 for sustainable development is definitely a milestone in the work of the organization for the years to come. the reform of the un development system comes at a time when the implementation of this agenda is to be accelerated at all levels, in a joint effort of the un system and the member states. we welcome the new reform vision by which the private sector will be more actively involved in achieving sustainable development at global, regional and national levels. this partnership has the potential to provide a new impetus for progress and innovation, including for financial mobilization, to make up for the gaps in finances that the organization is currently facing. in view of the agenda for sustainable development, the government of the republic of moldova has elaborated, through an inclusive and participatory process, a vision of a new development strategy called „moldova 2030 , fully aligned with its international commitments, including the moldova-eu association a reement. this new development strategy highlights the wellbeing and human rights, environment protection as well as cultivating an inclusive society as its top priorities. there are several ongoing projects aimed at materializing these objectives. we are currently implementing an ambitious national program to rehabilitate the road infrastructure across the country, to improve the connectivity and mobility of people, goods and services. we are introducing more profoundly innovation and technology in the sphere of public services for more accessibility, better quality, and transparency as well as for the elimination of corruption. we have managed to take an important step forward towards the integration of the republic of moldova into the european energy market by signing an agreement with the european bank for reconstruction and development for the financing of the biggest energy project of the republic of moldova since its independence. the country s energy independence is crucial for its sustainable development and social stability. we work actively with our international partners including un agencies and programs in the area of the enviromnent, to continually develop renewable energy and reduce gas emissions in accordance with our international commitments. given the complexity of agenda 2030, there are certainly several other initiatives which we pursue as part of our comprehensive sustainable development vision which we implement in line with this new integrative approach, in partnership with the united nations and our partners. 3 madame president, while in the field of development the united nations has managed to establish a reform vision endorsed by the general assembly resolution last may, in the sphere of security, where the political factor is more predominant, deficiencies still persist. the efficiency and relevance of the united nations in this area can not be fully achieved only through internal restructuring of its secretariat. delaying the reform of the security council in the last 25 years does not contribute to the respect for the un charter, the international law and the maintenance of international peace and security, which are the core prerogatives of this organization. we follow with great concern the violent conflicts in various parts of the world, with severe consequences for civilian population. the inability of the security council to take effective measures in these situations raises a legitimate question about its relevance as a decisional body for international security. from this perspective, the reform is key to restore the relevance and authority of the security council and, by extension, of the entire united nations, in matters of international peace and security. the republic of moldova supports the vision of an efficient, representative, democratic and inclusive security council, able to swiftly respond to complex security challenges. furthermore, as we declared several times in the past, we stand for the allocation of an additional non-permanent seat for the eastern european group of countries. and we hope that the membership of this assembly could come to an agreement on outstanding reform issues sooner rather than later. distinguished dele ates, the un charter requires our organization to play a proactive role in maintaining the international peace and security and in ensuring the respect for member states sovereignty and territorial integrity. by bringing before the un general assembly matters arising from challenges to their sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security, the member states do not seek confrontation or politicization in the work general assembly. it is only natural for such states to turn to un for assistance in promoting and encouraging solutions based on the strict observance of the international law and un charter. during the high level segment of the last session i reiterated, from this high-rostrum, the calls to the united nations to focus meaningfully on a grave breach of the international law and un charter, namely the continued presence of the russian military forces and armaments on the territory of the republic of moldova, without its consent and against its express wish. 4 i also appealed to the member states to support the inclusion in the agenda of general assembly of an item focused on this pressing security, olitical, legal and security issue faced by the republic of moldova. i am pleased to note that the general assembly adopted a resolution which declared straightforwardly that the russian federation s continued refusal to withdraw its military forces and armaments from the moldovan soil, unless some political preconditions of domestic nature are met by the republic of moldova, is incompatible with the rules of international law and the un charter. by adopting on 22 june 2018 the resolution a/72/282, the un general assembly has also unequivocally stressed that the russian federation’s non-compliance with the inte ational law and un charter has lead to clear violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of moldova and, subsequently, it must withdraw its military forces unconditionally, completely and with no further delay. the resolution is the first important milestone for consolidating the support of the united nations for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of moldova. in this context, i would like to express deep gratitude to all member states which co-sponsored the resolution or supported its adoption. last week, the general committee and, subsequently, the general assembly decided, by consensus, to include in the agenda of seventy-third session a new item, entitled the withdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory of the republic of moldova. the government of the republic of moldova welcomes this important decision which comes at a time hen the internal and sub-regional security has worsened due to repeated, unlawful and destabilizing activities of the foreign military forces and the unconstitutional power structures in the eastern part of the country. the joint military exercises of the operational group of russian forces, stationed illegally on moldovan soil, with the paramilitaries of the unconstitutional power structures, which have increased in scope and frequency, represent a continued violation of the 1992 moldovan-russian ceasefire agreement that contains a explicit legal binding commitment of the russian federation to ensure the neutrality of russian military forces during the process of their withdrawal from the territory of the republic of moldova. aiming at upgrading the military offensive capacity of unconstitutional power structures, the illegal joint military exercises undermine international efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of the protracted transnistrian problem. the republic of moldova, echoed by other osce member states, repeatedly expressed its deep concern with regard to these unlawful and continual destabilizing exercices that run contrary to the obligations of the russian federation in the framework of the “5+2 international settlement format. 5 from this high rostrum today, we appeal once again to the russian federation to discontinue these illegal and provocative activities and to resume unconditionally and without further delay the process of the withdrawal of its troops and armaments, in accordance with its legal commitments under 1999 istanbul summit outcome document and in observance of its obligations under the international law and the un charter. distinguished delegates, he complete and unconditional withdrawal of the foreign military forces from the territory of the republic of moldova will, undoubtedly, facilitate the settlement process of the transnistrian conflict and the reintegration of the country. despite the many difficulties encountered along the settlement process, the moldovan authorities are determined to find, within the „5+2 negotiating format, a political solution to this protracted conflict, externally generated, in the easte part of the republic of moldova. for us, it is extremely important that this solution is based on full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of moldova, providing a special status for the transnistrian region, as stipulated in the relevant osce documents. madame president, i would like to refer briefly to the goal of european integration of my country, which guides the reform agenda of the republic of moldova, particularly through the application of the association agreement with the european union. by aligning the republic of moldova to eu principles and standards and by harmonizing the national legislation with the european one, we aim to bring our country closer to eu and to ensure the sustainability of the modernization process. the extent of our cooperation with the eu is ample. it includes several dimensions, starting with the political, constructive and intensive dialog, to the creation of the free and comprehensive trade zone, inter-sectoral cooperation and taking stock of collaboration opportunities within the eastern partnership. in economic terms, the association agreement is a big step forward for the economy of the republic of moldova, while the european union has become the country s main trading partner. several positive results have been achieved in key sectors contributing to trade facilitation, growing the competitiveness of goods and services and opening new op ortunities for local producers. i am convinced that the implementation of the association agreement is the best and viable option to deliver prosperity and sustainable development for the republic of moldova and will warrant the irreversibility of the eu integration path. 6 distinguished dele ates, i would like to conclude by reaffirming the commitment of my country to continually promote the respect for un charter and to contribute to the achievement of internationally agreed un goals. i would also like to express the hope that the initiatives recently launched towards the consolidation of the organization s capacities will contribute to achieving better performance in the area of development as in the area of international peace and security. we shall remain truthful to un ideals and to its capacity to ensure the respect for international law. i thank you. 7","pavel filip, prime minister of the republic of moldova, welcomed the reforms of the secretary‑general in the face of current global challenges and transformation. by repositioning the united nations development system, they will be effectively contributing to the implementation of the 2030 agenda, a united nations milestone. for the reforms to yield results, transparent and constructive dialog between united nations management and member states will have to be sustained, he stressed, arguing the private sector will also need to be more actively involved in achieving sustainable development at the global, regional and national levels. his vision for a new development strategy called “moldova 2030”, including the moldova–european union association agreement, focuses on well‑being and human rights, environmental protection and cultivating an inclusive society. concerns such as improving road infrastructure; connectivity and mobility of people; goods and services; innovation and technology; and the elimination of corruption are part of a recent ambitious national program, he said, noting the agreement with the european bank for reconstruction and development towards the integration into the european energy market. energy independence is crucial for his country’s social stability, he added. while pointing out the persisting deficiencies in united nations security, he emphasized that efficiency and relevance of the organization can be fully achieved only through internal restructuring of its secretariat. he regretted the delay of reforms in the security council, given its inability to take effective measures in violent conflicts around the world, thus raising a legitimate question about its relevance as a decisional organ for international security. he also advocated for the allocation of an additional non‑permanent seat for the eastern european group of countries. referring to challenges to sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security, he highlighted the continued presence of the russian military forces and armaments on the territory of the republic of moldova as a grave breach of international law and the united nations charter. he welcomed an assembly resolution stating the russian federation’s non‑compliance to withdraw its military forces as a clear violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of his nation. the joint military exercises of the operational group of russian forces, illegally on moldovan soil, violate the 1992 moldovan‑russian ceasefire agreement, he stressed, noting that the increased exercises undermine international efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of the protracted transnistrian problem. in addition, he expressed deep concern that these exercises run contrary to the russian federation’s obligation in the framework of the “5+2” international settlement format, appealing to moscow to discontinue those illegal and provocative activities and to resume unconditionally to withdraw its troops in line with the 1999 istanbul summit outcome document. turning to the application of the association agreement with the european union, he expressed his aim to bring his nation closer to the european union and ensure the sustainability of the modernization process, pointing to many collaboration opportunities within the eastern partnership such as free trade zones, political dialog and intersectoral cooperation. he stressed that economically the association agreement is a big step forward with the european union being the main trading partner, adding that its implementation is the best and most viable option towards delivering prosperity and sustainable development to the republic of moldova."
Romania,"romania united nations general assembly -73rd session agenda item 8- general debate 26 september 2018, morning session address by h. e. mr. klaus werner lohannis, president of romania madame president of the general assembly, mr. secretary general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, i am particularly honored to address this year's session, as 2018 is a symbolic year for romania. one hundred years ago, the romanians accomplished their great dream, the dream of living together in one united country. the centenary of the united and modern romania is not only about the past of my country but even more about the future. and my strong conviction is that a safer and prosperous future for the romanian people can be accomplished only alongside peaceful and sustainable societies all over the world. in its turn, the united nations has reasons to celebrate this year. the universal declaration of human rights is turning 70 years old, and so is the international law commission, the main un body whose function is to shape international law in order for the intemational community to become a better place where international rule of law governs all of us. these anniversaries are a reminder of our political determination to stand up for our fundamental rights and law, although the road has neither been short nor easy. our action as political leaders is driven by the responsibility towards our people. we serve our people when working with the united nations, and each and every citizen needs to see a concrete impact on his or her daily life, and a positive change. 1 therefore welcome the invitation of the president of the general assembly to comment on the continuing relevance of the united nations for the lives and wellbeing of all peoples. we have to explain the current challenges to peace, equity and sustainability of our societies and to speak more about the role of the un in addressing them. we have to explain that we face serious threats to security, that terrorism needs a globally coordinated response, that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery remain existential threats to global security. pointing them out is necessary, but not enough. we need to address them by coming up with clear solutions. romania is working in this respect in its region. we continue to witness unresolved conflicts in the wider black sea area that pose serious threats to the region itself and to the international security. ladies and gentlemen, we adopted three years ago the 2030 agenda for sustainable development - a unique universal agenda for progress - and we have set 17 ambitious goals with significant impact on the most pressing challenges on the everyday-live of our people. romania, like many other countries, is in a learning process, a very useful exercise being the presentation of our national voluntary review in the high level political forum this july. at the same time, we have a lot to share from our own experience. therefore, romania will host in april 2019, in partnership with the un economic commission for europe, a regional conference on ""2030 agenda: partnerships for sustainable.development"". countries from our region will have the chance to share good practices and lessons learned in the process of implementation of the 2030 agenda and in identifying strategic opportunities for addressing key social drivers in our region, as well as looking at areas of sustainability and common interest. from another perspective, we are satisfied with our joint effort to prepare for the adoption, by the end of 2018, of some very important international cooperative frameworks. the global compacts on refugees and, respectively, on regular migration will generate a common approach on migration and displaced persons at global level. also, the negotiations on a.global pact for environment are about to start. the elaboration of the convention on conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction is in progress. a new ocean conference will take place soon-aimed at continuing the involvement for a safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed oceans at global level. in addition, the un global counterterrorism strategy and the plan of action to prevent violent extremism remain paramount. the list of achievements having a direct impact on our lives does not stop here, as we do not stop to advance our work together in the un and i believe that we can do more. we still have to work on making the whole un system, including the security council, truly coordinated, efficient, effective, transparent, accountable and fit to the realities of the international community in the 21®^ century. the next months will be decisive for the un reform. the implementation of the framework put in place as a result of the tireless work of the secretary general, with the support of the member states, will reflect the level of political determination of each country. romania will continue to support this effort. as the next presidency of the eu councii in the first half of 2019, romania will work with determination to strengthen the eu-un partnership. and when i speak about engagement i don't just mean politicians and diplomats. we have to reach out to our younger people, representatives of the civil society,journalists, business people. we need them all for the cause of multilateralism and global leadership. as you know, romania runs for a non-permanent seat in the security council for the term 20202021. through this candidature, we take our share of responsibility in the attempt to increase the effectiveness of the council. we hope that our track-record within the un will convince you once more that romania is committed to support the united nations work for peace and development for all its members. peace, development and justice are foundational pillars in our multilateral strategy. we respect our partners and rely on dialog. we count on your most valuable support for our candidature. romania will be a responsible partner in promoting a common agenda of the un. ladies and gentlemen, we have recognized the primary responsibility of the security council for international peace keeping and security in accordance with the un charter. as many crises are multidimensional today, the security council could play a more prominent role in addressing more aspects that impact peace and security. for example, climate change has become one of the toughest global challenges. its consequences- be it water shortage,food insecurity, displacement of people or rising sea levels - threaten lives all around the world. in addition to the efforts of other un platforms to tackle climate related risks, the security council, could create the framework to address them in an integrated manner. we welcomed the organization of a debate in the security council this july on aspects of peace and security related.to climate change and we are ready to follow-up on the topic if elected as a non-permanent member. ahead of the preparation of the secretary-general's climate summit next year, romania will host during its presidency of the eu council, in april 2019, an international conference on ""building resilience to natural disasters""- a platform to exchange views on how to assess and address more effectively climate-related security risks and to enhance the base for a resilient future. madame president of the general assembly, i thank you for the topic you have chosen for this debate and i congratulate you for the important responsibilities you have assumed. let me extend our wishes of success, and reassure you of the full cooperation of romania. thank you!","klaus werner iohannis, president of romania, noted the reasons the united nations has to celebrate this year, as both the universal declaration of human rights and the international law commission turns 70 years old. “these anniversaries are a reminder of our political determination to stand up for our fundamental rights and law,” he said. in addition, romania adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, he said, will host a regional conference on the 2030 agenda, where countries will share lessons learned. in addition, the global compacts on refugees and on regular migration will generate a common approach on migration and displaced persons at a global level. the united nations global counterterrorism strategy remains paramount. “we can do more,” he said, adding that the next months will be decisive for united nations reform. as the next president of the european union council in the first half of 2019, romania will work with determination to strengthen that bloc’s partnership with the united nations. speaking about the need for engagement, he noted that, “we have to reach out to our younger people, representatives of the civil society, journalists, and business people”. he also highlighted romania’s run for a non-permanent seat in the security council for the 2020‑2021 term. that chamber could play a more prominent role in addressing more factors that impact peace and security, such as climate change. on that note, he said that, ahead of the preparation of the secretary‑general’s climate summit next year, romania will host an international conference on building resilience to natural disasters, which is a platform to exchange views on how to assess and address more effectively climate-related security risks."
Russian Federation,,"sergey v. lavrov, minister for foreign affairs of the russian federation, said that, on one hand, there is the strengthening of the steady development of new centers of economic growth, and the aspirations of people to preserve sovereignty and choose development models that are consistent with their national, cultural and religious identities, among others. on the other hand, several western states want to retain their self‑proclaimed status as world leaders. these powers do not hesitate to use any methods, including political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force, while calling into question the legal validity of international treaties. such powers declare the priority of self‑serving unilateral approaches over decisions taken in the framework of the united nations. attacks have been launched against the basic principles of the middle east settlement, the joint comprehensive plan of action, the commitments within the world trade organization framework and many more. commenting on the situation in the middle east, among other things he stressed that the seven‑year conflict in syria is a failed attempt of a regime‑change orchestrated from the outside which, relying on the extremists, has almost resulted in the disintegration of the country and the emerging of a terrorist caliphate instead. the energetic actions by his country in response to the request of the syrian government, supported by the diplomatic steps in the framework of the astana process helped to prevent this fatal scenario. the congress of the syrian national dialog, initiated by his country, iran and turkey has created the conditions for a political settlement on the basis of security council resolution 2254 (2015). this is the basis for the “inter‑syrian constitutional committee” that is currently being established in geneva. its agenda includes the restoration of destroyed infrastructure to facilitate the return of millions of refugees to their homes. the growth of radical nationalism and neo‑fascism in ukraine, where criminals who fought under ss [nazi germany’s schutzstaffel] banners have been declared heroes, is one of the main factors in the protracted intra‑ukrainian conflict, he continued. the only way to settle the conflict is to ensure a comprehensive and consistent implementation of the minsk package of measures approved by the security council. his government supported the activities of the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce) mission in ukraine and is ready to provide its observers with united nations protection. instead of implementing the agreements, kyiv holds on to the hope that it might be able to bring occupying forces to donbass with the support of the west. it has been 20 years since his country initiated the discussion on cyberspace abuses and international information security at the united nations, he recalled. against the background of recent developments, it is becoming even more relevant to elaborate under the auspices of the united nations a set of global norms of responsible behavior of states in the information space, including the principles of non‑use of force, non‑interference in internal affairs, and respect for state sovereignty."
Rwanda,"address by president paul kagame 73rd united nations general assembly new york, 25 september 2018 we gather here and work together to make the united nations more relevant to all people. the positive developments in africa over the past year merit this body’s attention. let me start with a paradox. in no other region is the sense of trans-national solidarity and unity so deeply felt as in africa. the idea that our respective national identities stand in contradiction to pan-africanism is unheard of in our context. and yet, despite this unique civic endowment, africa has too often stood out for division and dysfunction in practice. this left africa unable to articulate and advance our common interests. we ceded responsibility for our future to others, not by force but by default. but times are changing rapidly, and so the management of africa’s global position must also change. the trend on our continent is toward closer and more productive cooperation, both through the african union and our regional economic communities. the evident decline of old certainties and authorities is not bringing turbulence to africa, as would have been the case, as of a previous era. on the contrary, the effect has been to focus africa’s attention on the urgent need to get our house in order and fundamentally change how we do business. that is why the african union initiated a major financial and institutional reform, more than three years ago. we are already seeing practical results. new financial discipline has produced an african union budget that is 12 per cent lower than last year. the share of funding supplied by member states has also increased substantially. contributions to the peace fund, which helps pay for african union peace support operations, are at the highest level since its establishment in 1993. and earlier this year, the historic african continental free trade area was signed, which was the culmination of decades of effort. once in force, africa’s place in the global economic and trade architecture will be redefined. economies of scale and higher levels of intra-african trade will help our continent attain the sustainable development goals by 2030. we will also see new possibilities for public-private partnership with africa’s growing private sector. this year also provided examples of regional security affairs and key political transitions being handled in a peaceful and forwardlooking manner. more effective consultation and leadership is reducing the need for external mediation, and this is how it should be. 2 the momentous developments in the horn of africa (ethiopia, eritrea, djibouti, and even somalia) are the most remarkable. the region’s leaders deserve our full support, as they set aside decades of mistrust and work toward a comprehensive settlement. it is important for the united nations security council to collaborate closely with the african union to accompany this process of normalization. in zimbabwe as well, the next stages on the country’s path of progress warrant steady encouragement from the international community. however, there are other situations in africa, notably the central african republic, libya, the sahel, and south sudan, where serious problems remain unresolved, despite so much potential. africa and the world should come together and do what needs to be done to harmonize overlapping initiatives and ensure that agreements are respected. peace and security are the foundation of economic and social well-being. yesterday, we happily marked the centenary of nelson mandela’s birth with the mandela peace summit. in that spirit, we are already set to embark on a new chapter in cooperation between the african union and the united nations on the stable funding of african union-mandated peace support operations. the resolution set to be introduced by africa’s three security council members has the full backing of the african union. this step will also align with the secretary-general’s new 3 action for peacekeeping initiative. this reflects, once again, that the dividend of a more focused and functional africa benefits everyone. in this wider context of even stronger partnership between our institutions, it is important for the african union’s diplomatic representation here at the united nations to be accorded the status and weight enjoyed by other regional bodies. the theme for this year’s general debate is making the united nations relevant to all people. this requires a commitment to achieving real multilateralism, where it has too often been lacking. the current two-track system of global governance is unsustainable. a few get to be the ones to define the norms by which others shall be judged. but standards that do not apply to everyone, equally, are not universal. addressing this imbalance in the very foundation of our system is what will give shape to a revival of multilateral cooperation and renew the legitimacy of the international institutions that are so crucial to our planet’s future. in the years ahead, we look forward to deepening this important partnership between africa and the united nations to advance our shared agenda of peace and security, gender equality and women’s empowerment, environmental protection, and shared prosperity. i thank you very much for your kind attention. 4","paul kagame, president of rwanda, spotlighted the paradox represented by both africa’s deep sense of transnational solidarity and its frequent division and dysfunction. “this left africa unable to articulate and advance our common interests,” he said, adding: “we ceded responsibility for our futures to others, not by force, but by default.” however, he emphasized that times are now changing rapidly, and africa’s global position must also change. he went on to say that the continent’s current trends are towards closer and more productive cooperation, both through the african union and regional economic communities. recalling that the former recently initiated major financial and institutional reforms, he said that practical results are already being seen. the african union’s budget is 12 per cent lower than in 2017 and the share of funding supplied by its member states has increased substantially. early in 2018, the historic african continental free trade area was signed, representing the culmination of decades of effort, he continued. once in force, africa’s place in the global economic and trade architecture will be redefined. economies of scale and higher levels of intra-african trade will help the continent attain the 17 sustainable development goals by 2030. underlining the importance of crucial developments in the horn of africa — where leaders have set aside decades of mistrust to work towards comprehensive settlements — he said the security council must work closely with the african union to accompany that normalization process. turning to other situations on the continent, such as those in the central african republic, libya, the sahel region and south sudan, he said africa and the world should come together to harmonize overlapping initiatives and ensure that agreements are respected. african countries stand ready to embark on a new chapter of cooperation between the continent and the united nations, based on the stable funding of african union-mandated peace support operations. in that regard, he noted that a resolution slated to be introduced by africa’s three present security council members enjoys the full backing of the african union and will align with the secretary-general’s new action for peacekeeping initiative. “the dividend of a more focused and functional africa benefits everyone,” he continued, emphasizing that against the backdrop of stronger partnerships the african union’s representation at the united nations must be accorded the same status and weight enjoyed by other major regional bodies. making the united nations relevant to all people requires a commitment to achieving real multilateralism where it has too often been lacking. indeed, the current two-track system of global governance — in which a few define the norms by which others will be judged — is unsustainable. “standards that do not apply to everyone, equally, are not universal,” he warned, adding: “addressing this imbalance in the very foundation of our system is what will give shape to a revival of multilateral cooperation.”"
Saint Kitts and Nevis,"statement y dr. the ono r ble timothy harris, m.p., j.p. prime minister of st kitts and nevis to the gener l debate of the 73rd session of the u ited nations general assembly new york, september 28, 2018 making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies madame president, mr. secretary general, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. it is indeed my privilege and honor, on behalf of the federation of st. kitts and nevis, to once agai address this general assembly. at the outset, permit me to congratulate you. madame president on your election, to lead this august body at this most significant time and as the first woman from the group of latin america and the caribbean (grulac) to assume the post. i assure you of my country s fullest support during your tenure. reform of the united nations the opening session of this un general assembly featured excerpts from former secretary general. kofi a nan of blessed memory, in which he made the case that to solve the wide range of global problems the united nations was critical. multilateralism with the un system at its fulcrum has long informed our global engagements. the united nations has been, is, and will continue to be critical to global peace, progress and prosperity. that is why madam president there is need to move i urgently to reform the un making it more responsive to the needs and conce s of ail and in particular small island developing states (sids). the un has become too preoccupied with summitry and less on delivery. the cooperation deficit among member states stymies the forward m rch of humanity. a reformed un must become a body of greater action and fewer words. we need urgent action on climate change, non communicable diseases (ncds), glob l cooperation, eace, prosperity and the reordering of the inte ational financial system. guided by this year s theme: making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared. responsibilities for peaceful, eq itable and sustainable societies ', my delegation, is of the view that this theme allows us to address the unfai ess and inequity of the inte ational development order and we urge a new and more inclusive, equitable and sustainable development paradigm,. sustai able society/ climate cha ge madame president, my country, though the smallest country in the western hemisphere, has always had its own set of goals, long before the mdgs and sdgs were enunciated. over a week ago, we celebrated thirty five (35) years of independence. we have made significant progress towards alleviating poverty, providing free primary and secondary education, providing access to affordable health care and enhancing the standard of living of our citizens. all these gains can be erased by the phenomenon of climate change. the damage the oecs sub-region sustained last year from hurricanes irma and maria was unimaginable. the united nations high level pledging conference in 2 the aftermath of these hurricanes was an attempt to chart the way forward in creating resilience and building back better. we ask that member states with outstanding commitments deal with these as soon as practicable. we applaud those countries which have already made good on their pledges. there is still a lot to be done to restore affected ember states but it requires strong, meaningful and enduring international partnerships. we continue to highlight, on the one hand, our inherent vulnerabilities to natural disasters, and on the other, an unflinching determination to maintain a sustainable society. our responsibility is clear. individually and collectively we must commit to reducing the amount of harmful materials we emit into the environment. it is a matter of great regret that nations such as my own continue to pay dearly for a debt we did not create. madame president, our people see the impact of climate change on their lives and livelihoods. climate change is largely the consequence of actions of more developed countries, their carbon emissions and harmful lifestyles. yet sids pay an unfair price. a price so hi h that, for many of us, climate change presents an existential threat. how will the un assist our region with the prevalence of the sargassum seaweed which has adversely impacted the caribbean? sargassum affects our marine environment in particular our coastal fisheries and. has affected the revenues of the fisher folk of the region. hotels, beaches and other touris , related activities have been severely impacted. it is my fervent hope that my plea today for international intervention will bring some relief to the people of our region. we have to hold countries accountable for environmental degradation not 3 only in their jurisdictions but also for the degradation they cause to other states. the united nations system presents the best vehicle for this. we welcome the funding mechanisms established to assist countries, particularly highly vulnerable sids. however, the process must be transparent, easily accessible and, most importantly, the commitments from donor countries must bear fruit. that being said, the international community cannot on the one hand claim to help sids while i the same vein classify us as middle and high-income countries based on archaic financial mo els that ultimately deny access to critical developmental assistance and hinder investment financing. we reiterate our calls for the international community to address with urgency the sterile measure of per capita income now employed. equally important, the issues of disaster risk, insurance and recognition of the unique vulnerabilities of small states .must be addressed. my country remains committed to the sustainable development goals and the commitments in the samoa pathway. internationai architecture the developmental efforts of small states are being thwarted by an unfair financial architecture with the threat of de-risking and loss of correspondent banking relationships. this is compounded, by the very discriminatory and irrational bl cklisting of countries that are forced to divert scarce resources to address the onerous and arbitrary demands of the eu code of conduct group and other entities created by large highly developed countries. it is absolutely unfair to subject some counties to evaluation and ever fluctuating standards while others are exempt. the threats to the survival of small states is real. i therefore call on this body to bring the light of small states like st. kitts and nevis to the forefront of 4 the inte ational discourse and to bring an end to such discriminatory practices. at great cost, my country and other small states are attempting to rise to the challenges posed by the unfair inte ational financial architecture. however, the frequency and arbitrariness of these unilateral demands derail essential development efforts in small states. i submit to this body that we deserve and have a right to expect fairness, transparency and consistency of treatment of all states. a clear rules based financial system which applies to all states must be our collective goal. conflict / peace and s fety my government is mindful that without peace there can be no shared prosperity. we have been aggressively confronting the problem of crime and violence from several fronts. we condemn all acts of violence and support efforts to maintain peace. my government will use every resource available to achieve a stable, peaceful and equitable society that our people expect and deserve. st. kitts and nevis supports the calls for diplomacy to address the conflicts around the world and is particularly heartened by the welcomed dialog on the korean peninsula. the caribbean is a zone of peace and our clear philosophy is to promote peace, friendship and dialog whilst avoiding conflict with other territories. in this regard a denuclearized world is a most desirable objective for all humankind. throughout the caribbean, we suffer from an increase in crime connected to the trade in small arms, light weapons and the drug trade. these weapons flow into the caribbean where they are not manufactured and are linked to an insatiable drug appetite in the west. it is beyond our power to unilaterally control the flow of guns 5 into the region or the habit that drives the dangerous global drug trade. we seek the assistance of the international community as we work tirelessly to address this scourge. my country remains fully committed to the arms trade treaty (att). our increasing internal budgetary allocations are an indication of our commitment to the aintenance of safety a d security. health madame president, st. kitts and nevis is elated that just this week, this august body joined together to commit to scaling up multi-stake older and multi-sectoral responses for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (ncds) in the context of the 2030 sustainable development agenda. our region remains encumbered by the unfortunate burden that ncds have placed on our society and economy. the statistics are stark and startling. 8 out of every 10 deaths in the caribbean are attributable to ncds, 40% of which are premature and 70% of this number is preven able. hypertension is our leading risk factor for death. the caribbean's diabetes rate is double the global rate. we are facing an ncd crisis in our region. in this regard we applaud the launch of the defeat-ncds partnership earlier this week and caricom and carpha shall rovide the fullest support to this new partnership. we endorse a holistic approach to health and i am happy to report that we have shifted into high gear to make an essential component, of global health, universal health coverage, a reality for all citizens in st. kitts and nevis. i must remind us that ncds and climate change are twin sides of the same coin. they are symptoms of the failure of the extant development paradigm. 6 social development madam president, my govermnent believes in making an equitable society a reality for all citizens in st. kitts and nevis. in keeping with our commitment to transform our world throu h the 2030 sustainable development agenda, we have endeavored to create an equitable pathway by improving the standard of living for the most vulnerable so they can become self-sufficient and productive citizens and residents. partnershi s i cannot address this great body and not recognize our dear friend tai an. my gove ment views the united nations as a people s organization, for all people, including the people of taiwan. we strongly believe taiwan has an important and continuing role to play in inte ational development strategies as they have had great success in technology, agriculture, health and renewable energy. we advocate that taiwan be given space to add to the dialog, progress and well being of the global community. we also continue to voice our support of our caribbean sister cuba and to call for the normalization of relations between cuba and the united states of america to alleviate the real suffering ca sed to the cuban people of this policy of exclusion. my country is conscious of the current difficulties in venezuela. venezuela has been a very good friend to the caribbean and st kitts and nevis continues to call 7 for peacef l dialog to resolve issues in venezuela with due regard to the rule of law a d the democratic ideals we old dear. conclusion as i close ma ame president, i must remind t at our people want action. they want results. we need to see all global leaders come together to create and maintain stability, equality and peace in our countries, so that our collective contributions can prevent and avoid war and violence; end the proliferation of nuclear weapons, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a d create a level playing field for small states to thrive. may we be always mindful and proactive to ensure that no country is left behind in the pursuit and achievement of the 2030 agenda. it is our shared responsibility to create the best opportunities and fulfill the expectations of our current and future generations. i am convinced, madame president that if we continue to ork steadfastly, always vigilant and focused on the overarching goals, we shall contribute to a more relevant, fair, productive and meaningful united nations, and by extension, a better world, for all our peoples. i thank you. 8","timothy s. harris, prime minister of saint kitts and nevis, called for urgent reforms to make the united nations more responsive to the needs and concerns of member states, particularly small island developing states. though it is the smallest country in the western hemisphere, saint kitts and nevis has made significant progress in the areas of poverty alleviation, free education and affordable health care. all those gains can be erased, however, by climate change, he said, calling on those states that participated in the united nations high-level pledging conference following hurricanes irma and maria to make good on their outstanding commitments. states must also commit to reducing harmful emissions into the environment, he said, expressing regret that nations like his must pay dearly for a debt they did not create. emphasizing that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing states, he wondered when the united nations will help the caribbean region to address the prevalence of sargassum seaweed, which is having an impact on fisheries and tourism. welcoming funding mechanisms to help highly vulnerable small island developing states, he said they must be transparent and easily accessible, with donor countries fulfilling their commitments. that said, the international community cannot claim to help those states, on the one hand, then classify them as middle- and high‑income countries based on archaic financial models that deny them critical development assistance and hinder investment financing. he went on to say that an unfair financial architecture, including the threat of de‑risking and loss of correspondent banking relationships, is thwarting development in small states. that is compounded by the blacklisting of countries forced to divert scarce resources to comply with the onerous demands of the european union council’s code of conduct group, among others. it is unfair to subject some countries to evaluation and ever‑fluctuating standards while others are exempt, he said, calling on the united nations to bring the plight of small states like his to the forefront of international debate and end such discriminatory practices. he added that the caribbean is suffering from an increase in crime related to the trade in small arms, light weapons and drugs. such weapons flow into the region, where they are not manufactured, and they are linked to an insatiable appetite for drugs in the west, he said, calling for international assistance to address that scourge and emphasizing his country’s commitment to the arms trade treaty. turning to health issues, he said eight out of 10 deaths in the caribbean can be attributed to non‑communicable diseases, with hypertension being the leading risk factor for death. “we are facing [a non‑communicable diseases] crisis in our region,” he said, reminding the assembly that non‑communicable diseases and climate change are two sides of the same coin — “symptoms of the failure of the extant development paradigm”. affirming his country’s commitment to the 2030 agenda, he said taiwan should be given space to participate in international dialog and development strategies. he called for the normalization of relations between cuba and the united states, as well as peaceful dialog to resolve rule of law and democracy issues in venezuela."
Saint Lucia,"i permanent mission of saint lucia to the united nations statement by the honorable allen m. chastanet prime minister of saint lucia and minister for finance, economic growth, job creation, external affairs and the public service to the general debate of the session of the united nations general assembly new york friday, 28™ september, 2018 . madame president, allow me, to begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the seventy third session ofthe general assembly. your assumption ofthis important office contributes to our progress inbreaking down the barriers of inequality - with you one of only four women to have held this position in seventy-three years. as the first woman from our latin america and caribbean region to have been elected president of ihe general assembly, we areespecially proud ofyour achievement. saint lucia is a staunch advocate for gender equality evidenced by the large percentage of saint lucian women who hold senior positions in and out of government, including the four female ministers in my cabinet. rest assured that you have my delegation's full support in the upcoming session. madame president, i stand before you today as a leader ofa small island developing state - asids, which is also a middle income coimtry - a mic. saint lucia's engagement in the international system is framed by acronyms that represent designations and categorizations that have been globally accepted. that sids are more vulnerable to natural hazards than other countries, has become accepted. that the resulting damage from natural disasters has a greater overall impact on our economies by virtue ofour small size has also become widely accepted. that sids which are also middle income coimtries face additional challenges because of the assumptions regarding the capabilities of countries carrying that designation has been acknowledged. we all know these truths - they are self-evident. these halls echo with the words of sids and mics leaders year after year making plain and clear the challenges we face. yet global policies, programs and strategies remain unfairly un-accommodating to these very real and true challenges. the world acknowledges our ""acronyms"" but little or nothing changes. saint lucia remains economically vulnerable to de-risking and the loss ofcorrespondent banking relations. we remain out of reach of any access to concessionary finance. our reputations are unfairly tarnished by tax labels. we continue to struggle under the weight of international frameworks that do not provide an enabling environment for my country to chart an effective sustainable development path, oreven to beable to take control ofourown destiny. madame president, despite the fact that the odds remain stacked against us. saint lucia must still persist. i have an obligation to the people of my coimtry, and so i must find new and innovative ways to keep my economy growing and ensure and enhance environmental and social protections. i do not have the luxury to wait for ihe international system to adjust to the special needs of countries like my own, while natural disasters continue to threaten and erode the gains we make. in preparation for this hurricane season. saint lucia has had to spend three times the amount of money than we did last season. in order to meet those costs, we have had to impose new taxes to facilitate this preparedness. for example, a water tax to assist with the de-suting of our dam, a gas tax to assist with road rehabilitation and slope stabilization and an airport tax toassist with the development ofa new terminal, highway and flood mitigation aroimd the airport. i cannot delay or ignore critical infrastructure projects, therefore have nochoice but to increase my debt burden, i cannot leave my country and its citizens exposed, i must find ways tomove forward. the president of the world bank has acknowledged that ""good health is the foundation of a country's human capital, and no coimtry can afford low-quality or unsafe healthcare."" the challenge of providing adequate and affordable healthcare is another area of focus for saint lucia. we understand that preventative and affordable healthcare is critical for the social development of any nation, more so a small island state with a small population. we are plagued with incidents of individuals who delay seeking early medical assistance due to the high cost, only to be saddled with a serious diagnosis later - a burden to the state and the individual that becomes far more expensive than the earlier cost. we have therefore taken steps to address the issue from multiple angles. we are working with partners like the european union and the world bank, with a goal of implementing the necessary policies and legislation to give life to a national health insurance scheme. we are also looking into preventive approaches, such as the imposition of appropriate labeling and a sugar tax, as we grapple with the high prevalence of non commimicable diseases. we are also expanding our after school programs that focus on building healthy lifestyles through physical activity and diet. we are establishing sports academies complete with nutritionists who will be community based so that theirexpertise canbe shared. madame president, saintlucia has worked hard to grow and develop, withinthe context of an mtemational system that acknowledges our existence and needs, only theoretically, because the practical and tangible manifestation ofthis acknowledgement israrely seen orfelt. we have seen the disastrous impact of natural disasters brought on by the changes in our climate. as i speak my country is suffering from the ravages of kirk, which was on a projected course north ofsaintlucia but changed direction overnightand moved directly overour island. this morning saint lucia also suffered from an earthquake. early reports indicate damage to our utilities that remain above ground and extensive damage to the agricultural sector - once again my heart goes out to the hard working men and women and to the communities who depend on agriculture. but be assured regardless of the difficulties, we will provide the necessary support to help them recover as quickly as possible. my thoughts and prayers are with government and people ofbarbados who have also been impacted and saint vincent and the grenadines and who now lie in the path of the storm. ourresilience as a people and our ability to pick ourselves up should never beused against us. i applaud japan, india and the numerous states within the united states of america who have the capacity to effectively respond to natural disasters, i envy that they have the necessary fiscal and policy space to enable them to recover and rebuild effectively, but we as sids are continually denied this ability. we are aware that dominica, the british virgin islands and puerto rico among others are still recovering one year on. yet little has changed. the caricom-un high level pledging conference to support reconstruction efforts in the region following hurricanes irma and maria, received pledges of over us$1.3 billion but there remains a significant gap between the pledges made and the actual amounts that have been disbursed. while well intended, we have been let down again. my delegation welcomes the initiative to convene a high level meeting on the challenges of middle income coimtries during this 73rd session of the general assembly. saint lucia has continued to place our concerns about debt sustainability onthe global agenda. we have joined the call for the creation of a highly indebted middle income country (himic) initiative; based notonly on the urgent need for debt relief, butalso on the need to acknowledge and highlight the negative implications of the challenges that middle income coimtries face in accessing concessionary financing so vital to building resilience in our countries. we fear a business as usual approach to this meeting, but remain hopeful that it produces substantive outputs with actionable solutions. madame president, multilateralism is under threat. we have heard the cries from leaders this week. the winds of nationalism that threaten to blow us away from our collective endeavors here at the united nations are growing. but saint lucia believes that it is only within a strong, functioning multilateral system that the guarantees ofworld peace and security can be provided. to borrow from our distinguished secretary general antonio guterres: ''in a world in which all problems are global, there is no way countries can handle issues by themselves; we need global responses."" the ongoing refonn of the united nations system is critical. the increasingly chaotic world requires an organization that is responsive and efficient and that reflects the political and economic reality of achanging world and of all its member states. we can no longer operate within a framework of ideologies, poucies, institutions and patterns of behavior that were established ina time long past to deal wifii circumstances long gone. we must be willing to challenge discrimination and exclusion if we endeavor to create an equal and just world for all. every country has arole to play in this global environment. we know this. saint lucia joins flie other voices calling for an end to the over half century-old embargo imposed on our neighbor, cuba and for an end to all restrictions on the rights of the cuban people, to uberty, security and advancement. similarly we call for an end to the restrictioiw placed on the legitimate aspirations of taiwan to participate as an observer in key international institutions, such as the who, icao and the unfccc. this is as much for us as it is for them. in our hemisphere where confrontations and disagreements exist, i reaffirm saint lucia's position that au conflicts must be resolved through diplomatic channels. as we work toward reform of this institution we must ensure that no one is left behind, we must find the political will and courage to ensure diat the evolved united nations not only acknowledge the challenges of its membership, but that it provides adequate solutions for all. madame president, notwithstanding the myriad challenges that frame our engagement in the international system. saint t'lcia remains committed to the objectives of multilaterausm. the adoption of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development was atriumph of multilateral cooperation, but it is the successful implementation of the agenda, the fulfillment of the promise of its purpose that will define the true measure of our collective will to transform and develop as aglobal community. it is within this context that saint lucia has committed to present our voluntary national review of our progress in implementing the 2030 agenda at the 2019 high level political forum. iam also pleased to report that saint lucia wiu be depositing the required instrument to ratify the doha amendment to the kyoto protocol, before the start of cop 24. this week saint lucia also reaffirmed our commitment to international law by signing on to the regional agreement on access to information, public participation and justice in environmental matters in latin america and the caribbean and the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. in order to build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, sids and sids who are mics have to look to different courses of action in order to arrive atmore immediate solutions to our development challenges, while we continue to call for changes in the international system. saint lucia has recorded two successive years ofconsistent economic growth, we have grown ourtax revenue and are on pace to attract record foreign direct investment. we are still competing, having to find new ways to ensure our growth and development, but imagine how much better we could do with building economic and social resilience to further enhance our ability to meet our sustainable development goals and improve the quality of life of our citizens, if a fair and just international enabling environment was made available tous. madame president, let us not forget that we come together here as nations united, to build institutions, norms and rules to advance shared interests - interests of all, not of a select few. the enormous challenges of our moment in history require a renewed social contract, one based on shared responsibility and the space to achieve this global compact is right here at the united nations. let us draw on the inspiration of nelson mandela and his incredible ability to forgive and find solutions for the greater human good. there is abuddhist proverb that reads: ""to know and not do, is not yet to know"". if we claim to know and accept the special circumstances and vulnerabilities of the sids, and yet we do nothing to remedy the systems and frameworks that exacerbate our vulnerability, do we really know? have we truly accepted? while the answers to these questions may not be readily available, countries like my own have to chart a development path through this changing and volatile world. it is my hope that as multilateralism evolves, and with it this institution, we arrive at ""knowing"" and at doing what must bedone.","allen michael chastanet, prime minister of saint lucia, underscored the challenges faced by small island developing states which are also middle‑income countries. while the world acknowledges their acronyms — “sids” and “mics”, small island developing states and middle-income countries, respectively — little or nothing changes. economically vulnerable to “de‑risking” and the loss of correspondent banking relations, unable to access concessionary financing and unfairly tarnished by tax labels, saint lucia struggles under the weight of international frameworks that make it difficult to chart an effective path to sustainable development or even take control of its destiny. “i do not have the luxury to wait for the international system to adjust to the special needs of countries like my own while natural disasters continue to threaten and erode the gains we make,” he said, informing the assembly that saint lucia today was struck by both a hurricane and an earthquake. stating that the resilience of saint lucians should never be used against them, he said there remains a significant gap between the $1.3 billion pledged for reconstruction following hurricanes irma and maria and the actual amounts that have been distributed. welcoming plans for a high‑level meeting during the current assembly session on the challenges of middle‑income countries, he said he hopes it will come up with actionable solutions, but fears it will be “business as usual”. emphasizing that the multilateral system is under threat, he said reforming the united nations is critical. the international community can no longer operate within a framework of ideologies, policies, institutions and patterns of behavior that were established a long time ago to deal with circumstances long gone. he called for an end to the embargo on cuba as well as an end to restrictions on the legitimate aspirations of taiwan for observer status in key international institutions such as the world health organization (who), international civil aviation organization (icao) and the united nations framework convention on climate change. describing the 2030 agenda as a triumph of multilateral cooperation, he said the fulfillment of its promise will define the true measure of the collective will to develop as a global community. in that regard, saint lucia will be depositing the required instrument to ratify the doha amendment to the kyoto protocol before the next conference of the parties to the paris agreement. it will also present its voluntary national review on progress in implementing the 2030 agenda at next year’s high‑level political forum on sustainable development. to build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, small island developing states — including those that are also middle‑income countries — must look to different courses of action to address their respective development challenges, he said. saint lucia has had two straight years of economic growth while increasing its tax revenue, and it is on track to attract a record level of foreign investment. however, imagine how much better his country could do in a fair and just international enabling environment, he underscored."
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,"st. vincent and the grenadines permanent mission of st. vincent and the grenadines to the united nations 685 third ave, suite 1108, new york, ny 10017 • tel:(212)599-0950 • fax:(212)599-1020 united nations general assembly (73rd session) statement by h.e. dr. ralph gonsalves prime minister of saint vincent and the grenadines at the general debate of the 73""^*^ session of the united nations general assembly september, 2018 new york madame president, our dear friend from ecuador; your excellencies: one decade ago, the world was convulsed by a cataclysmic collapse of its economic order. the devastating global economic and financial crisis began in the boardrooms of greedy banks and spread worldwide, with a rapidity that exposed the shortcomings of an unethical and underregulated international financial architecture. the adverse socio-economic impact of the crisis has been vast and far-reaching - especially for the countries least responsible for the genesis of the crisis. regrettably, the seemingly self-evident lessons of that economic and financial catastrophe have been distorted and manipulated, to disastrous effect. while the financial architecture has been quietly reassembled, with little more than ineffectual cosmetic changes, the post-crisis socio economic and political landscape has been radically reordered. economic difficulties have caused most of the major nations to look inward, eschewing the most noble and beneficial aspects of global cooperation. craven demagogues, clothed in populist robes, have emerged to exploit economic hardship and fan the flames of division, hatred and isolation. in all comers of the globe, the jarring rise of illiberal intolerance can be causally connected to the economic crisis and its continuing impact. solidarity has been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, illustrating the enduring prescience of the late kofi anan's observation that ''when economic conditions are difficult, people tend to be less generous and protect themselves; the question ofsolidarity doesn't mean much to them at that time."" we have retreated from the ethos of integration, cooperation and consensus-building that not only animated the pre-crisis decade, but which is absolutely necessary to solve the global problems that confront us. in a technologically connected, increasingly educated and rapidly shrinking global village, any belated attempt to place the genies of multilateralism and globalization back into their respective bottles, is dangerous folly. walls cannot replace bridges, isolation cannot replace cooperation, and clenched fists cannot shake hands. [make no mistake: a post-crisis era of muscular jingoism and bellicose isolationist behavior represents the most direct tlireat to the principles that undergird the united nations since its establishment 73 years ago. we are at decisive crossroads. we can either surrender to our worst instincts, and ensconce ourselves in our respective national cocoons and echo chambers, or we can appeal to the better angels of our nature, and reestablish the preeminence of the united nations by reaffirming the bedrock principles that have steered us clear of world wars and towards beneficial cooperation for the past seven decades.] the united nations is not without its many systemic flaws, and the ascendency of its unprincipled antithesis demands that we address those flaws most urgently. however, after seven decades, the united nations remains the only institution with the capacity and authority to enable global cooperation for our collective ennoblement. madame president, your well-chosen theme for this general debate speaks to the relevance of the united nations, of global leadership, and shared responsibility. it centers on a recommitment to the bedrock foundations of our charter: sovereign equality, non-interference and non-intervention, international peace and security, respect for international law and collective cooperation in solving global problems. it is precisely when times are most tumultuous, when deleterious alterations are upon us, that principles must be most unchanging, and fundamental truths must be most vigorously upheld. the principles of non-intervention and non-interference are of particular importance to small island developing states. lacking military might or economic wealth, and constrained within narrow borders, we owe our existence as nation states to a global recognition and respect for the principle that no other nation - large or small, rich or poor, near or far - should be allowed to interfere in our sovereign affairs or intervene in matters properly resident in our domestic jurisdiction. without strict adherence to those tenets, small states' existence dangles precariously on the threads of great power intrigue or changing perceptions of our strategic significance. without these principles, our international order reverts to a barbarism in which the strong are doing what they can and the weak merely suffering what they must. this is unacceptable. because of our undeniable reliance on this cornerstone of international law. small states are among its staunchest defenders. every violation of the principle of non-intervention - wherever it may occur - is an indirect assault on our own survival. this principle is immutable, and no amount of heavy-handed coercions or ham-fisted inducements will cause us to abandon our overarching existential interests in pursuit of short-term appeasement. our shared history of struggle against colonial oppression and exploitation informs not only our continuing pursuit of reparatory justice for the victims of native genocide and slavery, but places us in implacable opposition to any actions by those who seek illegally to impose their will on independent nations and peoples. as such. saint vincent and the grenadines stands firmly against the continued interventionist assaults on the sovereignty of our neighbors in the republic of cuba and the bolivarian republic of venezuela. the anachronistic economic blockade of cuba is both illegal and unproductive. the time has long since past for its complete repeal. we regret deeply that the fledgling rapprochement between the united states and cuba has stalled, and we call for a resumption of mutually respectful dialog between our two friends. in venezuela, the democratically-elected government has been subjected to an unacceptable, coordinated, intense external economic assault, which has had too, indirectly, a debilitating effect on small caribbean nations which have had generous arrangements of solidarity, for example, through the petro-caribe agreements. to be sure, venezuela has enormous intemal socio political challenges, but unwarranted and illegal intervention is entirely counter-productive in the people's ongoing quest for peace, democracy and liberty. venezuela needs a peace and reconciliation mission, not a campaign of sanctions, subversion and threats of armed intervention. constructive dialog between and among the contradictory parties and personalities is urgently required. the peoples of latin america and the caribbean have repeatedly reaffirmed that our region is a zone of peace. our peoples are not the pawns and playthings of any nation. our america, our caribbean defiantly affirm this; it is a noise in our blood, an echo in our bones. madame president, no intemational organization is better suited than the united nations to fulfill its foundational charter mandate of achieving]international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character'^ today, climate change is indisputably the defining, multifaceted existential problem that we collectively confront. however, the prospects for an effective intemational solution to climate change are rapidly receding. our carefully calibrated climate accords are teetering on the brink of irrelevance; wounded not only by high-profile withdrawals but also by the cynical and foolhardy noncompliance with voluntary mitigation pledges that major emitters have loudly declared, but quietly disregarded. the result of this ignoble hand-wringing and political procrastination is that the world continues to bum while its leaders fiddle. our sister island of dominica has been twice devastated by hurricanes erika and irma in the space of three years, with tropical storm isaac striking the island a glancing blow only weeks ago. beyond the headlines, the story of climate change is grimly told in daily experiences of floods, droughts, landslides, coastal erosions, lost lives and livelihoods across our region. we can wait no longer. the constellation of challenges, extemally-sourced, which face our small states demand a focused global response which recognizes in theory, and in practice, an undoubted small state exceptionalism. the many-sided concept of small state exceptionalism ought to be placed at the center of global discourse to prompt appropriate collective action. madame president, the rising seas and intensifying storms pose an existential threat to small island developing states. major emitters that fail to set-and honor -ambitious mitigation pledges are committing a direct act of hostility against sids, and we ought to resist their recklessness against our interests. in the same vein, the financing of climate resilience and adaptation measures by our development partners cannot be shoehomed into the same glacially slow, labyrinthine bureaucratic processes that have stymied other cooperation initiatives. our friends and partners must recognize the fierce urgency of this unfamiliar and unprecedented climate threat, and must demonstrate decisive political and developmental action to arrest this extraordinary existential threat. climate change cannot be handled by business-as-usual practices, however tried and true. our global climate accords have birthed entities with ostensible objectives to funnel and deliver urgently mitigation and adaptation financing to the most vulnerable states. however, these entities place the promised support at the center of an impenetrable web of unwieldy rules and processes that serve only to frustrate those most desperately in need oflife-saving cooperation. madame president, similarly, the intemational commitment to the sustainable development goals falters on the paucity of tangible global effort to their achievement and timeline. in saint vincent and the grenadines, the sustainable development goals are adopted and embedded within our national development plans. despite limited resources, we have created both a zero hunger trust fund and a disaster contingency fund - innovative and unique responses to our own sustainable development needs. we have mainstreamed and prioritized goals related to clean energy, economic growth, sustainability, climate action and biodiversity. we have chalked up home-grown progress in tandem with selfless solidarity from some of our regional and global friends and allies but much more is required to be done. [we knew from the outset that the sdgs could not be achieved without massive new commitments of resources, both within and across borders. goal 17 of the sdgs - partnership for the goals - is the fulcrum by which all other goals are realized. there have been a number of attempts to assess and quantify the resources necessary to attain the sdgs, but those assessments have been largely ignored in an era of cuts to development assistance and retreats from multilateral cooperation. unfortunately, like the battle against climate change, the attainment of the sdgs cannot proceed on the basis of hollow words and faith. faith without tangible works is dead. saint vincent and the grenadines therefore calls for a frank, high-level discussion on development assistance and mechanisms to fill the chasm between aspiration and realization.] 8 saint vincent and the grenadines continues to seek new avenues for people-centered development and economic growth amid rapidly-changing realities. the specter of trade wars poses an immense danger to our developmental aspirations, as does the continual tightening of the procedural noose around the throat of our banking and financial services industries. the prospect of de-risking and the loss of correspondent banking relationships is not an individual banking or business decision, but a clear and present threat to the economic viability of many small states. the modem manipulation of states' access to global banking and finance mechanisms - whether informed by politics, stigma or indifference - is a flagrant violation of the intemationallyrecognized right to development. it is imperialism of a most insidious kind, imposed facelessly from a distance. the united nations must urgently confront this grave and gathering menace in a coordinated and action-oriented manner. saint vincent and the grenadines is also making increasingly innovative forays into capitalizing on the vast potential of the blue economy,tourism, niche agricultural products and our historical knowledge in the medicinal cannabis industry. we seek the cooperation of our friends and partners in supporting these initiatives. [our nation, like many others, charts its developmental path not in a straight line, but in a relentlessly forward march over, around and through the obstacles we face. today, we are challenged by a host of problems, both of our own making and of an external genesis. however, no mater the challenge, our resilient and resourceful citizens remain ever confident in the triumph of our possibilities. ours is a people who have confronted all past and current challenges - from invading armies to encroaching seas - with an indomitable spirit of verve and optimism. we believe that, what ever the future brings, our faith will see us through. a faith in god, in ourselves, and in the principles that bind us together as a nation and as a caribbean civilization. we approach our multilateral engagements with a similar spirit.] madame president, saint vincent and the grenadines' faith in the principles and potential of the united nations is made manifest in its active participation in all aspects of this body. in recent years, we have demonstrated that small size is no impediment to impactful contributions on the world stage. saint vincent and the grenadines has played a leadership role in the un's post-financial crisis response; in revitalization of the general assembly; in security council reform; in advancing the law of the sea; in small arms control; in ambitious measures to combat climate change; and in the global response to non-communicable diseases. most recently. saint vincent and the grenadines chaired the administrative and budgetary committee of the united nations, and currently serves as the president ofthe economic and social council. in a similar manner, we feel the responsibility to bring our unique perspectives to bear on the work of the united nations security council. the perspectives of small states - inclusive of small island developing states - have been historically the least heard in the security council. as the threats to international peace and security have evolved in diverse ways, so too, has the need for a diversity of viewpoints on the security council increased. small island states have largely solved - and solved spectacularly - the challenge of forging peaceful, harmonious societies amidst many of the social, ethnic, political, historical and cultural fissures that 10 traditionally lie at the root of many breaches of international peace and security. we have confronted these challenges not with a surfeit of weapons or dollars, but with mutual respect, dialog, and an understanding that unique situations require not static ideological solutions, but flexibility and innovation geared towards the specificities ofthe issue at hand. the need for more of this type of practical, principled pragmatism on the security council is self-evident. it is why the candidacy of saint vincent and the grenadines has been endorsed by the member states of the caribbean community, and it is why saint vincent and the grenadines continues to call for reform of the membership ofthe security council to reflect modem realities and challenges. madame president, our pragmatism affords us the opportunity to see the world as it is, unencumbered by historical or ideological blinders. the united nations, which justly counts among its members states with populations as small as 10,000 people, somehow continues to remain blind to the 23 million residents of taiwan. there is simply no principled basis to deny taiwan the right to participate in the work ofthe specialized agencies ofthe united nations. madame president, the relevance of this institution is rooted in its responsiveness to the needs and challenges ofthe peoples we collectively represent. we can and must do more to address those needs in direct and 11 transformative ways. we must ever more match noble intent with decisive action in pursuit of our charter objectives. accordingly, we urge practical resolution ofthe pain and suffering of the palestinians, the people of yemen, and those afflicted by the evil of terrorism whether statesponsored or not. similarly, the madness of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the threat of their use is a standing affront to humanity, peace and security and thus demands our continued collective response. our international agenda for corrective action includes too: trafficking in persons; illegal drugs and small arms; refugees from ravaged lands; violence against women and children; the growing scarcity of water and food in many nations; the war against chronic non-communicable diseases; the rising tide of religious intolerance in certain places; and the reunification offamilies arising from abductions of yesteryear. [but beyond the indispensible utility of practical, targeted and tangible responses to issues and events, the united nations is also a powerful symbol of incredible resonance. it is a magnet, with the potential to draw us together and draw out of us the type of cooperation and solidarity that has formed the basis of all human triumph from time immemorial. it is a monument to our noblest instincts and greatest aspirations. it is a 73-year-old affirmation of the biblical observation that it is good and pleasant for brethren to dwell in unity.] madame president, we live amid frantic attempts in diverse quarters to rekindle the dying embers of xenophobia and unilateralism in pursuit of a past glory stuffed with mythology. but this noble institution is the keeper of a different flame. our bedrock principles stand as an open rebuke to those who traffick 12 in base triumphalism and pursue actions that are fueled by both short memories and short sightedness. ours is a flame of respect - for sovereignty, for diversity of views, for dialog, for peace and for development. in changing times, and amid new challenges, the principles that fuel this flame must be zealously defended. as keepers of this flame, and as holders of these principles in trust for future generations, we cannot falter and be found wanting in the face of reactionary assaults. another way is possible, and that way, that path, is lit by the timeless principles that continue to animate and invigorate the best efforts of the united nations. long may those principles continue to guide our collective journey of peace, prosperity and peoplecentred development. what then is required of us? the answer is timeless as it is wise: to do justly, to love mercy, and to work humbly with our god! i thank you. 13","ralph e. gonsalves, prime minister of saint vincent and the grenadines, said the adverse effects of the 2008 global economic and financial crisis have been far-reaching, especially for the countries least responsible for it. the financial architecture has been reassembled with little more than cosmetic changes; economic difficulties have caused many nations to look inward; craven demagogues have exploited economic hardship; and illiberal intolerance has risen in all corners of the world. “solidarity has been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency,” he said, underlining the need for integration, cooperation and consensus building. while acknowledging this context demands that the united nations systemic flaws be urgently addressed, he stressed that the organization remains the only institution with the authority and capacity to enable global cooperation. the principles of non-intervention and non-interference are of particular importance to small island developing states, given that they lack military might and wealth and are constrained within narrow borders, he continued. every violation of the principle of non-intervention is an indirect assault on their survival. consequently, his country stands firmly against interventionist assaults on the sovereignty of cuba and venezuela. he called for a resumption of respectful dialog between the united states and cuba. furthermore, unwarranted and illegal intervention in venezuela is an impediment to the people’s quest for peace, democracy and liberty. “the peoples of latin america and the caribbean have repeatedly reaffirmed that our region is a zone of peace. our peoples are not the pawns and playthings of any nation,” he stated. “beyond the headlines, the story of climate change is grimly told in daily experiences of floods, droughts, landslides, coastal erosions, lost lives and livelihoods across our region,” he said, describing climate change as a multifaceted existential problem. the prospects for an effective international solution are receding. he called for the concept of small state exceptionalism to be placed at the center of global discourse and responses addressing climate change. major emitters that fail to set and honor ambitious mitigation pledges are committing a direct act of hostility against small island developing states. decisive political and development action is urgently needed. global climate accords have placed promised support at the center of an impenetrable web of rules and processes that frustrate those most desperately in need of cooperation. the international commitment to the sustainable development goals suffers from the lack of tangible global efforts, he underscored. however, his country has embedded them in its national development plans and created a zero hunger trust fund and a disaster contingency fund. as it continues to seek new avenues for people-centered development and economic growth, the specter of trade wars looms, and its banking and financial industries face increasing procedural impediments. manipulating states’ access to global banking and finance mechanisms violates the internationally recognized right to development, he emphasized, urging the united states to confront this grave issue. highlighting his country’s active participation in the work of the united nations, he said the need for principled pragmatism on the security council requires that its membership be reformed to better reflect modern realities and challenges. “the relevance of this institution is rooted in its responsiveness to the needs and challenges of the peoples we collectively represent,” he stated. he pointed out that the united nations remains blind to the 23 million residents of taiwan even though there is no principled basis to deny it the right to participate in the work of the specialized agencies of the organization. he also called for practical resolutions to the pain and suffering of the palestinians and the people of yemen."
Samoa,"statement by honourabletuilaepalupesoliaisailelemalielegaoi, prime minister of the independent state of samoa at the general debate, united nations general assembly seventy third session. new york, 28 september 2018 madam president, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. i have had the privilege to address the general assembly in the last 21 yearsas samoa's prime minister and my message has remained consistent throughout the passing years. put simply, '^climate change poses the single greatest threat especially to small island developing states like samoa, not through our doing or choice, and that the need to take effective action to mitigate against climate change impacts is urgent and real"". climate change as well encompasses the breadth of security issues facing our blue pacific region including human security. environmental and resource security, transnational crime and cyber security. as we have explained to the united nations, climate change is one of the most pressing security challenges for island countries - affecting food security, access to safe water, fundamentally affecting our ability to draw sustenance from the pristine ocean and seas that surround us. climate change is the highest priority challenge facing countries of the world and does not discriminate between rich and poor. and the logic of our perspective is simple. climate change embodies the fullness of samoa's realities and aspirations. it impacts our society, our economy, our culture, our faith and our way of life and will continue to be our overriding priority policy concern and major pre-occupation including of our pacificregion, today and weli into the future. it is a societai problem requiring a decisive response from the world community. its giobal reach and impact shouid unite and strengthen our resolve, not weaken and divide us. as a united community, there is a great deal that we could achieve to arrest and even reverse the threat of climate change. its impacts are worsening by the day. no one country, or single group of nations, and no single organization can solely win the war against climate change. the divergent, yet inextricably linked interests of member states demands that we work together. our paris agreement on climate change was a beacon of hope especially for the vulnerable island states. it is based on shared responsibilities, trust, collaboration and principled action. it demonstrates a new brand of cooperation and broad outlook, where the narrow pursuits of self-interests, the use of economic and political expediencies were to be set aside. it was meant to be a timely reminder that no action is too small or insignificant. all contributions matter and every action counts irrespective of who provides it. importantly, it places the responsibility of addressing climate change squarely on every leader and on every individual country in terms of the implementation of their nationally determined contributions to the paris agreement. it is indeed worrisome and alarming that the level of commitments to the paris agreement by member states will not keep global warming anywhere below 1.5 degrees celsius which is the ideal and moral goal to save planet earth. without that, the continuing existence of some low-lying islands in our pacific region and elsewhere will be in grave doubt. we must work together with a sense of urgency and commitment to address climate change, today, and now. it should not just be the science that recommends what we should do, but also our conscience and the political will to follow through. clearly, we want leaders who view the world as a single constituency where all must work together within the limits of their capacity and capability to be part of the total solution. samoa wants to be part of the solution because it is in our interest to do so. as for those suggesting they are implementing bold actions for the sake of our vulnerable islands, they need to be quietly reminded that in the final analysis, implementation initiatives, will ultimately benefit their economies, people and survival of their countries. for vulnerable countries, the issue is not about setting new targets, commissioning more studies and reports or even more polite talk shops and structured dialog sessions, it is about adaptation now and long-term survival. the united nations remains our last best hope to provide the political will and the necessary commitment to turn the tide against climate change. samoa appeals to member states of our organization in positions of world leadership, to lead the charge in finding and implementing solutions to the causes of climate change. as custodians of our world's environment, we owe it to our future generations to do what needs to be done quickly, and decisively. in the same way that nations in leadership roles are called to account in doing the right thing for our world, so must all the member states of the un uphold their part of the bargain in the work that needs to be done. without this cooperation from all member states, reaching the objectives we all know should be achieved, would continue to elude us. the pacific region is already facing the destructive impacts of climate change and disasters. cyclones, floods, droughts. sea level rise and ocean acidification are taking their toll on the health and well being of our peoples, environment and economies. disaster related economic losses in pacific isiand countries as a percentage of gdp are higher than aimost anywhere else in the world. our people are waiting, the world is watching. it is incumbent on each individual leader and country to raise the level of ambition not just as an inspirational goal, but as deliverables of the paris agreement. for the pacific peoples and our blue pacific region, urgent ambitious action on climate change is the only option. we welcome the determination resonated in the unsecretary general's remarks to the general assembly earlier this month to 'sound the alarm' on the need for bolder action on climate change. these are big asks to deliver on. it will be naive to think otherwise. but when the future existence of sovereign island nations, populations and cultures are at stake, then there is a moral imperative for the world to act decisively and collectively. madam president the pacific leaders are increasinaiv conscious of and concerned about the security of our reoion. and we look at security not just from the orthodox perspective of state security, but what security means for us pacific communities. the framework for pacific regionalism identifies security as one of the four objectives of regionalism - ""security that ensures stable and safe human, environmental and political conditions for all"". forum leaders have renewed commitment to work together as one blue pacific continent particularly in view of the renewed geopolitical interests in the pacific region. suddenly the pacific is swimming in a rising tide of so-called 'fit for purpose' strategies stretched from the tip of africa, encompassing the indian ocean and morphing into the vast blue pacificocean continent - that is our home and place. the big powers are doggedly pursuing strategies to widen and extend their reach and inculcating a far-reaching sense of insecurity. the renewed vigor with which a tree and open indo-pacific strategy' is being advocated and pursued leaves us with much uncertainty. for the pacific there is a real risk of privileging indo over the 'pacific' while the pacific region currently enjoys a period of relative stability, drivers of instability exist in the region and beyond. the 2017 state of pacific regionalism report indicated that shifting global and regional geopolitics is creating an increasingly complex and crowded region that places the pacific at the center of contemporary global geopolitics. this trend, coupled with broader challenges such as climate change, rising inequality, resource depletion, maritime boundary disputes and advances in technology, will continue to shape the pacific regional security environment. while the world be-labors the issues of security around military might and the wonders of technological advancement in reaching such ends, our priority in the pacific is to maintain stability of our governments and countries. we can do this through a review of our governance pathways and ensure that our elected leaders respond to people's needs. pacific island forum members have a proud history of working collectively in response to events and issues that have challenged regional security, peace and stability, from the 1985 rarotonga treaty created a nuclear free zone in the south pacific, to a collective approach to addressing the existential threat of climate change. the pacific region's current geopolitical and geostrategic context underlines the need for an integrated and comprehensive security architecture, incorporating an expanded concept of security. a stable and resilient security environment provides the platform for achieving the region's sustainable development aspirations. in recognition of this, in 2017, forum leaders ""agreed to build on the biketawa declaration and other forum security related declarations as a foundation for strategic future regional responses, recognizing the importance of an expanded concept of security and regional cooperation in building resilience to disasters and climate change.^"" leaders have also prioritized action on climate change and disaster risk management, fisheries, and oceans management and conservation - all of which have significant security elements. as if being vulnerable to climate change is not a lifelong challenge, the label of ""pacific small island developing state"" can also have its unintended trials and tribulations. for far too long we have been given to believe ""'they are little and classified 'have nots'. we are susceptible to being characterized as countries that have little, and that we should be grateful for whatever is offered to us. we are highly protective of our means of livelihoods and have embraced regional action to ensure the sustainability of our fisheries resources. and we are actively asserting our ambitions to ensure that there is inheritance for the generations to come. any such approach for engagement with partners must be genuine and durable and premised on understanding, friendship, mutual benefit and a collective ambition to achieve sustainable results. they must also be nonpartisan and non-interventionist. and in the process, our partners have fallen short of acknowledging the integrity of pacific leadership and the responsibility they carry for every decision made, in order to garner support for the sustainable development of their nations. some might say that there is a 'patronizing' nuance in believing that pacific nations do not know what they were doing or were incapable of reaping the benefits of close relations with countries that are and will be in the region for some time to come. in cases where emerging partners have engaged with pacific countries without conditionality, the relationships are perceived to be associated with corruption or unprecedented environmental degradation. one has the tendency to be bemused by the fact that the reaction is an attempt to hide what we see as strategic neglect. 8 where we are now would not have been possible without the valuable support of our circle of partners, and the value of the partnerships we had nurtured and cultivated over the years to respond to the multitude of needs of our people. the friendly relations we have with some partners are construed by others as compromising and obtrusive, prompting someto speak up for us to ward off the influences we are supposedly too naive to recognize. by the same token we are given alternatives that reflect interests beyond altruism and conversion of the poor. as pacific leaders we need to ask ourselves what we ought to do in order to make a difference for us and for the world - and to promote our values premised on peace stability and security. our geographical isolation and insularity no longer shields or protects us from the increasingly complex and dynamic security challenges transnational crime, nuclear proliferation, challenges to sovereignty, and humanitarian crises. the rules based international system is being bent out of shape. gone were the days when we took only what we needed from our environment; when we were a lot more conscious of the importance of the continuity of our cultures and values, unadulterated by the infringing, impinging world around us. then, we did not worry much about borders because the original migrations of our peoples defined for us our ocean space and place. poverty was not a part of our consciousness because we cared for each other and the oceans provided their bounty. we should not be influenced by economic dependence as that is a compromise in itself. we should seek to strengthen domestic cohesion, develop resilience and rethink our governance pathways. the leaders of the pacific islands forum are committed to a vision for the pacific - that it be a region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity, so that all pacific people can lead free, healthy, and productive lives now and into the future and moreover, we have committed to working together to achieve this vision. the blue pacific platform offers all pacific countries the adaptive capabilities to address a changing geostrategic landscape. the opportunity to realize the full benefits of the blue pacific rests in our ability to work and stand together as a political bloc. and the challenge for us is maintaining solidarity in the face of intense engagement of an ever growing number of partners in our region. we should not let that divide us! madam president in 4 weeks time, samoa will be hosting the interregional meeting of small island developing states and their development partners in preparation for the five-year review of the samoa pathway during the high-level week next year in september. my government looks forward to welcoming our guests and we thank the united nations member states and the small island developing states in particular for agreeing to allow the samoa pathway to make a brief return to its namesake and birthplace. 10 let me conclude by acknowledging the support of all those member states of the united nations, samoa's circle of friends, who supported our candidate's re-election to the committee on the rights of the child. thank you 11","tuilaepa sailele malielegaoi, prime minister of samoa, pointed out that his message to the assembly over the last 21 years has remained consistent: climate change constitutes a huge threat to small island developing states such as his. action is urgently needed to mitigate that real threat, he said, adding that climate change encompasses the breadth of security issues facing the blue pacific region, including human, environmental and resource security, transnational crime and cybersecurity. it affects food security, access to safe water, and fundamentally affects samoans’ ability to draw sustenance from the pristine ocean around them, he lamented. the global reach of climate change, he added, should unite and strengthen the international community s resolve, not weaken and divide it. as a united community, there is a great deal it could do to arrest and even reverse climate change. but, no one country, or single group of nations, and no single organization can solely wage and win the war against climate change. describing the paris agreement on climate change as a beacon of hope for vulnerable island states, he noted that it is based on shared responsibilities, trust, collaboration and principled action. it demonstrates “a new brand of cooperation” and a broad outlook, that set aside the narrow pursuits of self‑interest and the use of economic and political expediencies. for vulnerable countries, “the issue is not about setting new targets, commissioning more studies and reports or even more polite talk shops and structured dialog sessions”, he stressed. it is about adaptation now and long‑term survival. the united nations remained their best hope to provide the political will to turn the tide against climate change. outlining the destructive impacts of climate change that the pacific region is already facing, he noted that cyclones, floods, droughts, sea level rise and ocean acidification are taking their toll on the health of people, environments and economies. “our people are waiting, the world is watching,” he said calling on each individual leader and country to raise the level of ambition, not just as an inspirational goal, but as deliverables of the paris agreement. for the pacific people, urgent, ambitious action on climate change is the only option, he underscored, welcoming the determination resonated in the secretary‑general’s remarks earlier this month to “sound the alarm” on the need for bolder action. these are big tasks, but when the future existence of sovereign island nations, populations and cultures is at stake, then there is a moral imperative for the world to act decisively and collectively. turning to the renewed geopolitical interests in the pacific region, he said, suddenly the “pacific is swimming in a rising tide of so‑called fit‑for‑purpose strategies stretching from the tip of africa, encompassing the indian ocean and morphing us into the vast blue pacific ocean continent”. the big powers are doggedly pursuing ways in which to widen and extend their reach, inculcating a sense of insecurity. noting that the renewed vigor with which a “free and open indo‑pacific strategy” is being advocated leaves the region with much uncertainty, he said there is a real risk of privileging “indo” over the “pacific”. any approach for engagement with partners must be genuine, durable and premised on understanding, and mutual benefit, he stressed."
San Marino,"republic of san marino statement by h.e. mr. nicola renzi minister of foreign and political affairs with functions of prime minister of the republic of san marino at the general debate of the 73'^^^ session of the united nations general assembly new york,29 september 2018 madam president, mr. secretary general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the government of the republic of san marino, i would like to congratulate h.e. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her election as president of the 73rd session of the un general assembly and to wish her a fruitful work. fler long experience both as ecuador's ambassador to the united nations and as minister of foreign affairs, as well as her deep knowledge of the organization, are valuable resources for the united nations. the republic of san marino, which this year has taken on the role of vicepresident of the general assembly, supports the priorities of her agenda, as set out in her inaugural speech, and believes that these are important to give a fundamental impetus to the necessary reforms concerning the most important areas of the un activity. the san marino delegation will ensure you. madam president, its utmost collaboration during all works of the general assembly. i would also like to express my country's gratitude to the outgoing president, h.e. miroslav lajcak, for the important work carried out during the 72nd session. my country would also like to extend its special thanks to secretary general antonio guterres, for his energy and determination in leading the united nations and in the reform processes of the organization. madam president, the theme chosen for this session,""making the united nations relevant to au people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable, and sustainable societies"", is undoubtedly of great relevance. it gives member states the opportunity to contribute constructively to the work of the general assembly. there is a strong correlation between the two concepts that make up the subject of the debate: on the one hand, while the united nations must be closer to its citizens by translating the fundamental principles of its global action into concrete results, it is essential, on the other hand, not only to defend, but also to strengthen international cooperation and our organization. recent developments in the global socio-political landscape have created obstacles to the development of multilateralism and are putting it at risk. today,in consideration of the magnitude of global challenges, their increasingly evident interrelationships, the need for member states to work together to overcome difficulties, it is more and more essential to adopt an approach towards common and coordinated policies,in one word multilateralism. the republic of san marino has decided to cooperate within the framework of international structures and mechanisms at the top of which is the united nations, because it believes in the strength of dialog, democracy and respect for others. indeed, the very peaceful coexistence of peoples reues on such values. my country believes that the united nations must increase its leadership role in the management of global governance due to its deeply democratic nature, its universal participation and undisputed legitimacy. the cultural diversity and traditions represented within the united nations are not an obstacle, but an enormous asset, which makes it possible to adopt an approach reconciling the interests of the international community, so as to attain human and sustainable development. we cannot ignore the fact that in recent years other fora, such as the g20,have and are exerting a great influence at the global level in the management of global governance. san marino is grateful to these informal groups for the role they have played. however, in their decision-making process, these groups should be more transparent and inclusive and should take into account the interests, concerns and aspirations of the countries that are excluded, in particular those of developing countries. the action of these informal groups must not be in competition with, but complementary to that of the united nations. trust, inclusiveness and dialog are essential elements in support of multilateralism and its ability to produce concrete results at the global level. madam president, this year s theme is inevitably linked to the un reform process. this process is of fundamental importance for the future world balance, for guaranteeing international peace and security and must remain at the center of all our efforts. the reforms must make the structures of the organization functional to the objectives of its global action: the credibility and authoritativeness of the united nations depend on its ability to transform objectives into concrete actions that have a real and measurable impact on the lives of people. the united nations must be closer to its citizens, communicate better and show them the importance and effectiveness of multilateral collaboration for the lives of all of us. in this regard, the republic of san marino reiterates its support to the reform agenda secretary-general antonio guterres is implementing in the fields of peace and security, management and un development system. we are confident that these reforms will improve un contribution to sustainable development, will ensure greater effectiveness in the resolution of armed conflicts, in the search for sustainable peace, and ultimately will strengthen the un system's ability to produce more concrete and visible results. madam president, the republic of san marino expresses its concern about the increasing number of conflicts in many parts of the world and supports the coordinated action of the united nations in the field of peacebuilding and peacekeeping. religious radicalism, terrorism, transnational organized crime, trafficking in drugs and human beings, weapons of mass destmction, violent extremism, marginalization and exclusion pose a threat to international peace and security. it is essential to analyze the root causes of conflicts if we want to favor disarmament and de-radicahsation. at the same time, we need to promote, through education, respect for and protection of human rights, the rule of law and access to justice. the united nations has often been criticized in recent years for the inability of the security council to intervene adequately in syria and other conflict situations. unfortunately, this has undermined the credibility of our organization. the republic of san marino hopes that the security council wiu now be able to fulfill its mandate effectively. in this regard and in order to support a rapid and decisive action of the security council,i am pleased to recall that my country has joined the code of conduct drawn up by the act group (accountability, coherence, transparency) to refrain from using veto in cases of crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. san marino has also joined the joint proposal by france and mexico for voluntary suspension of the veto by the permanent members of the security council. in pursuing the goals of peacemaking and sustainable peace, the united nations must promote a strategic partnership in which governments, the united nations system, international, regional and sub-regional organizations, civil society, the private sector and universities work together to achieve common goals. the relationship between peace and development is clear: there can be no sustainable development without peace, just as there can be no peace without sustainable development. in this regard, the implementation of agenda 2030 becomes essential for the construction ofinclusive, resilient and peaceful societies. three years have passed since the adoption of agenda 2030. the international community is working hard to make the sustainable development goals(sdgs)come true. while, on the one hand, progress has been made in the implementation of some goals and targets, on the other hand, it should be noted that there are strong inequalities in the implementation of the agenda not only between countries but also within them. the republic of san marino underlines the central role plaid by the high-level political forum in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives, thanks to its fouow-up activity. in this context, san marino supports the ministerial declaration that was adopted this year by the forum. madam president, the most difficult and important challenge to the achievement of the objective of sustainable development is the eradication of poverty in au its forms and dimensions,in particular extreme poverty. although the level of extreme poverty has fallen significantly in the last ten years, as shown by the data contained in the secretary general's report on sdgs, poverty nevertheless remains the main cause of hunger and the number of undernourished people reached 815 million in 2016. the agenda emphasizes universal respect for human rights and human dignity: peace, justice, equality and non-discrimination are fundamental rights whose implementation becomes essential for the construction of inclusive societies. the principle according to which no one should be left behind requires the adoption of specific measures to support people in vulnerable situations. agenda 2030 takes into account the needs of children, young people, people with disabilities, the elderly, indigenous people, refugees, displaced persons, migrants, people living in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies, or in situations of armed conflict. respect for cultural and ethnic diversity, as well as equal opportunities are central to the full realization of human potential. the promotion of actions in support of children and young people is a key element, since they must grow up free from all forms of abuse and exploitation. unfortunately, children pay a very high price in areas of armed conflict: many lose their lives, are kidnapped, raped, used as a shield or recruited as soldiers. moreover, their schools are often destroyed, as are their hospitals, depriving them of their fundamental rights. my country, which is part of the group of friends of caac, believes that international humanitarian laws and human rights laws must be respected in conflict situations. san marino has ratified the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of the child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts and it supports the paris commitments. moreover, this year san marino has added its name to the list of countries supporting the safe schools declaration, an important tool for the protection of educational facilities from military use during conflicts. only with the effective and fuu participation of women in decision-making processes that have a direct impact on their lives, will it be possible to build sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies. the republic of san marino reaffirms its commitment to the fight against au forms of violence based on gender, all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation. the objective of gender equality, emancipation of women and girls and full realization of their human rights must be achieved. gender equality must also be translated into equality in educational opportunities, with particular regard to scientific subjects, because technology, science and innovation in general play a vital role in meeting global challenges and in the promotion of sustainable development. at the same time - and the republic of san marino is particularly convinced of this - the perception of sustainable development through new technologies, science and innovation must be transmitted through means of communication that do not distort the truth, so as not to undermine the very concept of freedom. the republic of san marino, in this regard, is offering a concrete and motivated contribution, also at international level, to the theme of correct information, with the objective of combating the increasingly dangerous phenomenon of fake news, which is deceptive, uncontrolled and able to incite hatred and nurture prejudices. the commitment of the international community must be directed towards all vulnerable groups, without exception. people with disabilities and the elderly, for example, must be guaranteed full participation in social, economic and cultural life. madam president, the effects of climate change are one of the greatest challenges of our time because of their unprecedented impact on our lives and, in particular, on the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable. at 1.1 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels, 2017 was one of the hottest three years of all time. the effects of chmate change do not respect national borders, they spread everywhere, in every country and continent. they are increasingly damaging national economies, communities and countries. this is a global problem that requires solutions that need to be coordinated globally. moreover,it is essential to strengthen international cooperation in order to help developing countries to move towards a low-emission economy. the republic of san marino recognizes the deep synergy between the implementation of the paris agreement on chmate change and agenda 2030 and welcomes the recent entry into force of the agreement. events related to climate change, such as drought, which generates food and water shortages, have increased competition to have access to these and other natural resources. conflicts are a major cause of food insecurity. as a result, about 74 million people today are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. the number of conflicts has increased over the last decade and has led to the displacement of miuions of people. in 2017, 68 milhon people were forced to leave their homes. in addition to persecution and armed conflicts, natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes, partly due to the effects of climate change, have forced millions of people to seek refuge in other countries. other disasters, such as socio-economic deprivations, lack of food, water, education and health, have led miuions of people to seek their fortune elsewhere. all this has contributed to the increase in migratory flows, a major challenge that the international community has been facing for some years. san marino has followed the intergovernmental negotiations that led, at the end ofjuly, to the finauzation of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, to be formally adopted in december during the intergovernmental conference in morocco. given its transnational nature, no country can face the migration phenomenon on its own. the compact strengthens the universality of human rights, including those of migrants, their dignity - regardless of their status -, access to basic rights and their protection. its objective is not to stop migration, but to manage it in the best possible way through strengthened international cooperation. my country believes that the implementation of the compact wiu bring greater security, order and economic progress for the benefit of all. the global compact is a clear example of what multilateralism can do, of its potential and importance, similarly to the recent agenda 2030, the paris agreement on climate change and the addis ababa action agenda. indeed, through tangible measures aimed at financing development, the compact lays the foundations for a global plan of action. madam president, in order to face today's world challenges, we need a renewed commitment to multilateralism. this is only possible through a strong united nations organization, capable of coordinating, in an effective way, our economic, environmental and social poucies at a global, regional and local level. in conclusion, i would lilce to reiterate the strong support of the republic of san marino to all initiatives aimed at implementing the principles enshrined in the charter of the united nations. thank you for your attention.","nicola renzi, minister for foreign and political affairs of san marino, said global developments are putting multilateralism at risk at a time when member states must work together to adopt common and coordinated policies. san marino believes that the united nations — with its deeply democratic nature, its universal participation and its undisputed legitimacy — must increase its leadership role in managing global governance. he reiterated his country’s support for the secretary‑general’s reforms, saying they will strengthen the organization’s ability to produce more concrete results. the security council’s inability to intervene in syria and other conflict areas has undermined the united nations’ credibility, he said, reiterating san marino’s position that permanent members not use their power of veto in decisions involving genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. emphasizing the relationship between peace and development, he said there remain strong inequalities in the implementation of the 2030 agenda, within and between countries. the principle of leaving no one behind requires specific measures to support those living in vulnerable situations. he emphasized the need for children to grow up free of all forms of abuse and exploitation, as well as the importance of respecting international humanitarian law and human rights law in conflict situations. gender equality must be translated into equality in educational opportunities, particularly in scientific areas. he added that san marino is contributing at the international level to efforts aimed at combating the increasingly dangerous phenomenon of fake news, which is deceptive, uncontrolled and liable to incite hatred and to nurture prejudice. as well, persons with disabilities and the elderly must be guaranteed full participation in social, economic and cultural life, he continued. climate change is a global problem that needs globally coordinated solutions, including more international cooperation to help developing countries move towards a low‑emission economy. he added that implementation of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration — “a clear example of what multilateralism can do” — will bring greater security, order and economic progress to the benefit of all."
Sao Tome and Principe,"perm nent mission of the democr tic republic of sao tome and principe to the united nations 73rd session of the united nations gener l assembly general debate new york, 29 september 2018 statement by his excellency ¦ mr. urbino jose gon alves botelho minister of foreign affairs and communities of the democratic republic of sao tome and principe 675 third ave ue, suite 1807, new york, ny 10017 madam president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly your excellency the secretary-general of the united nations heads of state nd government your e cellences ministers of foreign affairs and e ternal relations distinguished delegates l die and gentlemen your excellences, it is with great honor and satisfaction that, for the first time, i address this magna general assembly, as the minister of foreign affairs and communities, representing the de ocratic rep blic of sao tome and principe. first of all, let me, with great pleasure, address my first words to her excellency maria fernanda espinosa garces, whom i congratulate for her election to the presidency of the 73rd session of the general assembly of the united nations, expressing our support to your excellency in the course of your mandate, which, we believe, will be very successful. we emphasize the fact that your e cellency is only the fourth woman to undertake such a noble function and we hope this number to increase in the future in the name of a greater inclusion of women in positions of such i portance in the organization. i also congratulate the outgoing president, his e cellency miroslav lajcak, for the manner in which he has conducted the work of the previous general assembly session, in a judicious, zealous and selfless ay, in an extremely difficult international context. i also would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the memory of the former secretarygeneral of the united nations, the late kofi annan. a man who dedicated his life in making the, world a more peaceful place and worked tirelessly for that purpose, always with a great sense of our humanity. we must preserve his legacy by continuing to strengthen our organization as the ultimate and overall guarantor for the search for peaceful, durable, consensual solutions, 2 legitimated by inte ational law, in order to achieve the desired goals of peace, security, stability and progress for all. madam president ladies and gentlemen we welcome the choice of the theme for this session: making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared-responsibilities for peaceful, equitable nd sustainable societies. indeed, our organization is . facing very complex challenges for which it is called to provide effective, concrete and comprehensive responses that are truly relevant to all eople. let us emphasize the issue of migration, where the global leadership of the united nations must at all times manifest itself in fostering dialog among nations seeking global solutions and promoting concerted policies in hosting the refugees, as well as in supporting their countries of origin, to better address this world-wide roblem, that often has devastating consequences for those . who in search of better living conditions, are exposed to flagrant injustices everywhere. if we really want peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, our efforts must continue to be conducted seeking solutions not only to migratory problems but also, at the negotiation table, to mitigate the effects of the current armed conflicts existing throughout the world, and to prevent the emergence and escalation of regional tensions which can generate others of the same kind. we therefore launch from this tribune a strong appeal to continue the dialog aiming the peaceful resolution of tensions that are occurring all over the planet, areas of conflict that keep claimin thousands of innocent lives, in particular the conflict in syria. we also continue to call for an understanding in the central african republic, so that the negotiations can put an end to a conflict that has harmed thousands of people, whose refugee situation has led to a serious humanitarian crisis in the country. we warmly salute our sister republic of guinea bissau for convening legislative elections next november, and express them the best of lucks as we are certain that these elections will mark a 3 new era of harmony and prosperity ith the resumption of the regular functioning of its democratic institutions. in the same way, we also salute the democratic republic of congo by convening the general elections scheduled for december this year, and we formulate warm vows for them to be trans arent and fair and conducted in a peaceful and harmonious environ ent. on the other hand, we are pleased to note that positive steps have been taken concerning the reconciliation processes between ethiopia and eritrea as well as between the belligerent parties in the re ublic of south sudan, and we strongl encourage for this path to be continued. regarding the sahara matter, we express our support to the secretary-general of the united nations and his personal envoy, in their efforts to relaunch the political process on the basis of the parameters set by the security council in 2007, and we welcome the adoption of its resolution 2414 which calls for the need to achieve a olitical, pragmatic, realistic and long lasting solution for the dispute. the democratic republic of sao tome and principe welcomes the historic developments on the korean peninsula and calls on all those involved to continue the dialog and negotiations in the benefit of the interests of all parties, towards the development of the region. with regard to the situation in the middle east, we appeal for the dialog and the continuation of negotiations to find a peaceful and negotiated solution in respecting to the right of the palestinian people to conduct their own destiny, accordingly with the fundamental princi les of international law. in the same line, we renew our call for efforts to continue to be pursued to nonnalize the relations between cuba and the united states of a erica so that we can see the lifting of the trade embargo as soon as possible, which has for decades been an obstacle to the progress of that country. once again, unfortunately, we must regret the terrorist acts that insist to claim so many lives around the world. such heinous acts, without any respect for human life, will always merit from us the fir est and vehement condemnation. . 4 we also take this sovereign opportunity to condemn the terrorist acts of boko haram on the territory of our neighbors and brothers, the federal republic of nigeria, whose harmful consequences continue to undermine the development and security of the entire gulf of guinea. likewise, we strongly condemn the terrorist acts that have caused so much suffering to the martyred peoples of the sahel region, in particular the republics of mali, niger and burkina faso. we reaffir the strong com itment of the democratic republic of sao tome and principe to actively collaborate with its regional and inte ational partners in all initiatives aimed at eradicating this phenomenon from our societies. only by acting together can we truly build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, as the theme of this session suggests. madam president ladies and gentlemen the leadership role of our organization undoubtedly goes hand in hand with actions that bring together efforts to combat climate change. every day we are confronted with the devastating effects of climate change around the world. natural disasters are occurring on a larger scale and ith greater intensity, leading to the loss of lives, especially in the least developed regions of our planet. the global effort must continue under the auspices of the united nations framework convention on climate change, and indeed it must be a shared responsibility for everyone, because it is up to all of us to safeguard the future of coming generations. it is therefore urgent to put into practice the provisions of the paris agreement, so that the necessary technical, financial and hu an resources are properly directed to ards the immensity of the task we have in hands. we therefore call for the next conference of the parties, the cop 24, which will be held in katowice, poland, in december, to be very successful and that the dialog that has been taken place could in fact make it possible to implement that agreement. sao tome and principe will do everything in its power to advocate the crucial importance of com on and universal efforts to ado t the necessary policies in this regard. 5 likewise, we refer to the sustainable development goals, whose achievement of the established targets, in order to really benefit everyone, ill greatly require the support of the different specialized agencies of our organization, in formulating and implementing the policies necessary for its aterialization. sao tome principe notes with particular appreciation what has been the ractice in our country, where such collaboration has allowed us to. take irm steps in that direction. we must also highlight and welcome the continued efforts of the african union in the implementation of the inclusive agenda 2063, the materialization of which, we believe, will enable' african countries to free themselves from the chains of overty, thus enabling their peoples to have a better future. the spirit that has guided us so far must continue to be strengthened, ta ing into account our specificities and constantly remembering what unites us: the well-being and development of the whole of africa. madam president ladies and gentlemen the democratic republic of sao tome and principe, a small developing island state, with all the constraints that this condition entails, pursues a policy adapted to its reality, respecting multicultural diversity and human rights. with an economy that is very vulnerable to exte al shocks, the government currently in charge has designed and has made efforts to achieve an ambitious transformation agenda for the 2030 horizon. these actions closely follow the uidelines of both the sustainable development goals and the agenda 2063 of the african union. it has been a difficult task and we would like to register the support of both the organizations, that have closely collaborated with the government, and our important bilateral partners, who s support the democratic republic of sao tome and principe widely acknowledges, and since it is not a finished one, we would very much appreciate to continue counting on such contributions. on next october 7, sao tome and principe will hold legislative, local and regional elections. we call on the inte ational community to join us as independent observers to once again witness the 6 strength and quality of our democracy, which will be further consolidated with this electoral act that reveals our democratic ma urity. madam president ladies and gentlemen our organization must indeed assu e its global leadership role in the congregation of efforts for the development of all peoples; in the unceasing pursuit of peaceful solutions to the conflicts t at continue to exist in the world; in efforts to combat climate change; in reducing inequalities; in promoting gender equality and equity policies; in combating the scourge of terrorism and hatred based on race, sexual orientation and religious beliefs; in promotin intercultural dialog among peoples; and in the uncompromising defense of peace and human rights. these values, hich we are sure we all share, must be continually observed and all of our efforts must be conducive to their protection and reinforcement in a spirit of frank and open dialog that benefits all. the democratic re ublic of sao tome and principe maintains and reaffir s its unequivocal commitment to the ideals of peace and frate ity amongst eoples, and will always collaborate very closely so that our common problems could have common solutions and shared responsibilities, so that we can build, under the ideals of our organization, a more prosperous, just, peaceful and sustainable societies. i thank you for your attention. 7","urbino jose goncalves botelho, minister for foreign affairs of sao tome and principe, said the united nations must manifest itself in fostering dialog among nations and promoting concerted policies to address the migration crisis. he appealed to member states to continue efforts to resolve tensions and conflicts around the world, particularly in the central african republic and the humanitarian crisis there. he saluted guinea-bissau and the democratic republic of the congo on the upcoming elections in those countries and noted the positive steps towards reconciliation in ethiopia and eritrea, and in south sudan. he supported the efforts of the secretary-general and his special envoy to relaunch the political process concerning western sahara based on the parameters set by the security council in 2007 and welcome the adoption of council resolution 2414 (2018), which calls for a political, pragmatic, realistic and long-lasting solution for the dispute. he called for the continuation of negotiations in the middle east and the normalization of relations between the united states and cuba so the embargo on the latter may be lifted. he regretted terrorist acts around the world and condemned the acts of boko haram in nigeria, which undermined the development and security of the entire gulf of guinea. he reaffirmed his country’s commitment to collaborate with regional and international partners to eradicate terrorism. turning to climate change, he said global efforts must continue under the auspices of the united nations framework convention on climate change and put into practice the provisions of the paris agreement. he looked forward to the next conference of the parties (cop 24) in poland to continue the dialog and move forward to implementation. achieving the sustainable development goals will require the support of specialized united nations agencies, he said, also highlighting and welcoming the efforts of the african union in the implementation of the inclusive agenda 2063. he noted his government’s efforts to achieve both the sustainable development goals and agenda 2063, calling both the united nations and the african union important bilateral partners. looking forward to his own country’s upcoming elections, he invited the international community to join as independent observers to witness the strength of his country’s democracy. sao tome and principe must assume its leadership role in the congregation of efforts for the development of all peoples, he concluded, reaffirming his country’s commitment to the ideals of peace and fraternity among people."
Saudi Arabia,,"adel ahmed al-jubeir, minister for foreign affairs of saudi arabia, said his country is focusing on a peaceful solution to conflict, undertaking various mediation efforts. the peace agreement reached between ethiopia and eritrea should be deemed historic and essential. “this illustrates the political and critical role played by saudi arabia in the advancement of international peace and security,” he said. turning to the rights of the palestinian people, he underscored their right to an independent state, and the need to respect relevant security council resolutions. on the conflict in yemen, he said that houthi militia continue to manufacture missiles and carry out activities that destabilize the region. he stressed the need for a political solution to the crisis in yemen. saudi arabia will continue to facilitate all humanitarian efforts to alleviate the suffering of the yemeni people, he added, underscoring that his nation provides economic support and essential supplies to yemen. terrorism and extremism are major challenges facing the world, he continued, also adding: “our region has never been spared.” the kingdom has set up institutions to oversee the fight against terrorism and extremism. on iran, he said that tehran continues its terrorist activities and aggressive conduct, expressing support for the latest united states policy on iran. tehran has trained and armed terrorist militias. such aggressive conduct constitutes a glaring breach of all international laws and treaties. “iran should be held accountable in the international legal system,” he stressed. turning to the boycott against qatar, he said that doha supports terrorists and hosts extremists, and spreads hateful rhetoric through its media outlets. the syrian crisis has entered its eighth year, he continued, stressing that that country’s people must be able to live on their own soil. saudi arabia supports legitimacy in libya, he added, urging libya’s unity and respect for its territorial integrity. the international regime that has existed for centuries is rooted in sovereignty and respect for international law. “this is not up for discussion. sovereignty is a red line that cannot be crossed,” he stressed. the kingdom has placed the saudi citizen at the heart of its development plans."
Secretary-General of the United Nations,"***embargo until delivery*** ****** the secretary-general -address to the general assembly new york, 25 september 2018 your excellency madam president of the general assembly, distinguished heads of state and government, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, our world is suffering from a bad case of “trust deficit disorder”. people are feeling troubled and insecure. trust is at a breaking point. trust in national institutions. trust among states. trust in the rules-based global order. within countries, people are losing faith in political establishments, polarization is on the rise and populism is on the march. among countries, cooperation is less certain and more difficult. divisions in the security council are stark. trust in global governance is also fragile, as 21st-century challenges outpace 20th-century institutions and mindsets. we have never had a true system of global governance, much less a fully democratic one. still, across many decades, we established solid foundations for international cooperation. we came together as united nations to build institutions, norms and rules to advance shared interests. 1 we raised standards of living for millions, forged peace in troubled lands and — indeed — avoided a third world war. but none of this can be taken for granted. today, world order is increasingly chaotic. power relations are less clear. universal values are being eroded. democratic principles are under siege. the rule of law is being undermined. impunity is on the rise, as leaders and states push the boundaries at home and in the international arena. we face a set of paradoxes. the world is more connected, yet societies are becoming more fragmented. challenges are growing outward, while many people are turning inward. multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that we are moving in the direction of a multipolar world. but multipolarity will not, in itself, guarantee peace or solve global problems. a century ago, europe was multipolar. a balance of power was deemed sufficient to keep rivals in check. it was not. without strong multilateral frameworks for european-wide cooperation and problem-solving, the result was a grievous world war. today, with shifts in the balance of power, the risk of confrontation may increase. 2 in assessing the peloponnesian war in ancient greece, thucydides said, and i quote, “it was the rise of athens and the fear that this instilled in sparta that made war inevitable.” this is what the political scientist graham allison calls the “thucydides trap”. but in his book “destined for war”, reviewing many examples of rivalry in the past, he concluded that conflict is never inevitable. indeed, with leadership committed to strategic cooperation and to managing competing interests, we can avoid war and steer the world onto a safer path. individual leaders have the duty to advance the well-being of their people. but it runs deeper. together, as guardians of the common good, we also have a duty to promote and support a reformed, reinvigorated and strengthened multilateral system. we need renewed commitment to a rules-based order, with the united nations at its center and with the different institutions and treaties that bring the charter to life. and we need to show the added value of international cooperation by delivering peace, defending human rights and driving economic and social progress for women and men everywhere. that is why i am so committed to reform, and to making the united nations more effective in responding to the needs and aspirations of “we the peoples”. in the face of massive, existential threats to people and planet -- but equally at a time of compelling opportunities for shared prosperity -- there is no way forward but collective, common-sense action for the common good. this is how we rebuild trust. excellencies, in my address last year, i highlighted seven challenges. one year on, they remain sadly unresolved. there is outrage at our inability to end the wars in syria, yemen and elsewhere. 3 the rohingya people remain exiled, traumatized and in misery, still yearning for safety and justice. palestinians and israelis are still locked in endless conflict, with the two-state solution more and more distant. the threat of terror looms, fed by the root causes of radicalization and violent extremism. and terrorism is ever more interlinked with international organized crime and the trafficking of people, drugs and arms. the nuclear peril has not eased, with non-proliferation at serious risk. nucleararmed states are modernizing their arsenals. a new arms race could be triggered, and the threshold for their use lowered. we have seen outrageous uses of chemical weapons, in full impunity despite their ban. protections against dangerous biological weapons are weak. inequality is undermining faith in the social contract and is a clear obstacle to the achievement of the sustainable development goals. tensions over trade are on the rise. migrants and refugees continue to face discrimination and demagoguery in the context of clearly insufficient international cooperation. and in this year marking the 70th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, the human rights agenda is losing ground and authoritarianism is on the rise. as the politics of pessimism spreads, we must guard against self-fulfilling prophecies. those who see their neighbors as dangerous may cause a threat where there was none. those who close their borders to regular migration only fuel the work of traffickers. and those who ignore human rights in combatting terrorism tend to breed the very extremism they are trying to end. excellencies, 4 it is our common duty to reverse these trends and resolve these challenges. we need to move ahead based on facts, not fear — on reason, not illusion. prevention must be at the center of all we do. this session of the general assembly is a real opportunity for progress. to mention just one example, i welcome the strong show of support for my action for peacekeeping initiative – which has been endorsed by 148 states and organizations. it aims to help our missions succeed in today’s protracted and volatile contexts. but today i want to concentrate on two epochal challenges which, since last year, have taken on surpassing urgency: climate change and the new risks associated with advances in technology. let me take them each in turn. ladies and gentlemen, first, the direct existential threat of climate change. we have reached a pivotal moment. if we do not change course in the next two years, we risk runaway climate change. climate change is moving faster than we are – and its speed has provoked a sonic boom sos across our world. according to the world meteorological organization, the past two decades included 18 of the warmest years since record-keeping began in 1850. this year, for the first time, thick permanent sea ice north of greenland began to break up. the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the highest in 3 million years – and rising. 5 making matters worse, we — as a community of world leaders — are not doing enough. we must listen to the earth’s best scientists. we must see what is happening before our eyes. we need greater ambition and a greater sense of urgency. we must guarantee the implementation of the paris agreement. it has immense potential to set us on the right course, but its targets -- which represent the bare minimum to avoid the worst impacts of climate change -- are far from being met. i am concerned that recent negotiations in bangkok towards implementation guidelines ended without sufficient progress. the next conference of parties, cop24 in poland in december, will be a key moment. it must be a success. as i said recently, we cannot allow katowice to remind us of the divisions among member states that paralyzed copenhagen. the good news is: technology is on our side. clean energy is more affordable and competitive than ever. if we pursue the right path, climate action could add $26 trillion to the global economy by 2030. green economy policies could create 24 million new jobs. more and more companies and investors are finding that green business is good business. far from being a fundamental threat to the economy, climate action is generating new industries, new markets, more jobs and less dependency on fossil fuels. the real danger is not the threat to one’s economy that comes from acting. it is, instead, the risk to one’s economy by failing to act. governments need to be courageous and smart. that means ending trillions of dollars in subsidies for fossil fuels. it means establishing an adequate price for carbon. 6 it means stopping investments in unsustainable infrastructure that lock in bad practices for decades to come. our future is at stake. nothing is immune -- climate change affects everything – and everything can be undermined. keeping our planet’s warming to well below 2 degrees is essential for global prosperity and the security of nations. that is why, next september, i will convene a climate summit to mobilize action and finance. we will bring together countries and cities, the real economy and real politics, business, finance and civil society, to focus on the heart of the problem. the summit will take place one year before countries have to enhance their national climate pledges under the paris agreement. only a significantly higher level of ambition will do – and the summit will be an opportunity for leaders and partners to showcase their ambition. for this to be possible, we must act today. the world needs you to be climate champions. excellencies, let me now turn to new technologies and what we can do to uphold their promise and keep their perils at bay. and there is great promise. scientific progress has helped to cure deadly diseases, feed growing populations, drive economic growth and connect businesses, communities, families and friends across the world. rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and biotechnology have the potential to turbocharge progress towards the sustainable development goals. artificial intelligence is connecting people across languages, and supporting doctors in making better diagnoses. driverless vehicles will revolutionize transportation. but there are also risks and serious dangers. 7 technological advances may disrupt labor markets as traditional jobs change or disappear, even as the number of young job-seekers continues to grow. retraining will be needed at previously unimaginable scales. education must adapt, from the earliest grades. the very nature of work will change. governments may have to consider stronger social safety net programs, including, possibly, universal basic income. at the same time, technology is being misused by terrorists and for sexual exploitation and abuse. organized criminal networks lurk on the dark web, profiting from encryption and near-anonymous cryptocurrency payments to traffic in people and illegal goods. some reports estimate that cybercrime is now putting $1.5 trillion in the pockets of cybercriminals annually. malicious acts in cyberspace – such as disinformation campaigns -- are polarizing communities and diminishing trust among states. and more and more people are getting their information from news or social media feeds that echo their views, reinforce tribalism and assure people that they are right and the other side is wrong. the digital revolution is also being used to discriminate against women and reinforce our male-dominated culture. indeed, there is a deep gender gap in access to digital technologies, widening the digital divide. we must dismantle obstacles and create opportunities for women, ensure equality fand change on-line and toxic corporate cultures. the technology sector must open up and become more diverse – not least for its own benefit. with technology outracing institutions, cooperation between countries and among stakeholders will be crucial, including member states, the private sector, research centers, civil society and academia. there are many mutually beneficial solutions for digital challenges. we urgently need to find and apply them. at the united nations, we are harnessing technologies in support of the sustainable development goals. we are creating innovation labs, including in 8 my office. and in july i established a high-level panel on digital cooperation, a dialog platform for all key actors. excellencies, the impacts of new technologies on warfare are a direct threat to our common responsibility to guarantee peace and security. the weaponization of artificial intelligence is a growing concern. the prospect of weapons that can select and attack a target on their own raises multiple alarms — and could trigger new arms races. diminished oversight of weapons has implications for our efforts to contain threats, prevent escalation and adhere to international humanitarian and human rights law. let’s call it as it is. the prospect of machines with the discretion and power to take human life is morally repugnant. heaven forbid, any new war could very well include with a massive cyberattack not only targeting military capacities, but also critical civilian infrastructure. i am encouraged by the ten possible guiding principles elaborated in geneva last month by the group of governmental experts on lethal autonomous weapons systems. more work on these issues, aimed at building trust between and within nations, will be needed if we are to ensure responsible use of new technologies. i urge you to use the united nations as a platform to draw global attention to these crucial matters and nurture a digital future that is safe and beneficial for all. excellencies, despite the chaos and confusion of our world, i see winds of hope blowing around the globe. just days ago, i witnessed the signing of a historic peace agreement between the leaders of ethiopia and eritrea in saudi arabia 9 soon after, the presidents of djibouti and eritrea met in jeddah to launch a peace process. eritrea and somalia have established diplomatic relations. and in the same region, in the context of a summit of the intergovernmental authority on development, the two rival leaders in south sudan have finally signed a peace agreement. i am hopeful that these efforts will continue to be consolidated so that the people of the horn of africa can finally turn the page on war and conflict. the courageous initiative of the singapore summit between the leaders of the united states and the democratic people’s republic of korea, along with the recent meeting of the two korean leaders in pyeongyang, offers hope for the possibility of a full and verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a context of regional security. in my recent visit to colombia, i was impressed by the peoples’ strong commitment to peace, now reaffirmed by president duque. in central asia, i personally witnessed strengthened cooperation after uzbekistan went through a peaceful political transition. greece and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia have taken a major step towards resolving their differences. our peacekeeping mission in liberia ended a decade-and-a-half of work this year following the country’s first peaceful democratic transition, adding to peacekeeping successes elsewhere in west africa. the approval of compacts on refugees and migration represents another sign of hope, even if there is still a long way to go to reconcile full respect for the rights of people on the move with the legitimate interests of states. hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of extreme poverty across the world over the past three decades, and we averted looming famine in four countries in the past two years. armenia’s young people were at the heart of that country’s peaceful political transition earlier this year – showing the potential of youth to use their voice to advance democracy. 10 and the drive for gender equality is gaining ground, amid a growing awareness of pervasive discrimination against women and girls, from violence, harassment and exploitation to unequal pay and exclusion from decision-making. the united nations must lead the way in pursuit of gender equality. for the first time in united nations history, there is full parity in our senior management group and among resident coordinators leading country teams around the world. we are firmly committed to equality and empowerment everywhere. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, as our late secretary-general, kofi, once reminded us: “we share a common destiny. we can master it only if we face it together. and that, my friends, is why we have the united nations”. our future rests on solidarity. we must repair broken trust. we must reinvigorate our multilateral project. and we must uphold dignity for one and all. thank you. *** 11","antónio guterres, secretary-general of the united nations, said the world is suffering from a bad case of “trust deficit disorder”, with people losing faith in political establishments amid rising polarization and populism. cooperation among states is more difficult, divisions within the security council stark, and trust in global governance fragile as twenty-first century challenges outpace twentieth century institutions and mindsets. while living standards for millions have improved, and a third world war avoided, that cannot be taken for granted. “multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most,” he said. while a multipolar world will not in itself guarantee peace or solve global problems, shifts in the balance of power may increase the risk of confrontation, he cautioned. leaders have the duty to advance the well-being of their people, but as guardians of the common good, they also have a duty to promote and support a reformed, reinvigorated and strengthened multilateral system. leaders must renew their commitment to a rules-based order, with the united nations at its center and with the different institutions and treaties that bring the united nations charter to life, he stated. they must also demonstrate the added value of international cooperation by delivering peace, defending human rights and driving economic and social progress for women and men everywhere. “in the face of massive existential threats to people and planet — but, equally, at a time of compelling opportunities for shared prosperity — there is no way forward but collective, common-sense action for the common good,” he underscored. “this is how we rebuild trust.” recalling the seven challenges he set out in his address to the general debate at the opening of the seventy-second session a year ago, he noted that, sadly, they remain unresolved. he cited, among other things, wars in syria and yemen, the situation of the rohingya people, the israel-palestinian conflict, nuclear peril, the use of chemical weapons, trade tensions, discrimination against refugees and migrants, and growing authoritarianism as the human rights agenda loses ground. it is the common duty of all to reverse those trends and move ahead on the basis of facts, not fear, with prevention at the heart of all efforts. focusing on climate change, which represents a direct existential threat, he stressed: “we have reached a pivotal moment. if we do not change course in the next two years, we risk runaway climate change.” world leaders must listen to scientists, see what is happening before their very eyes and guarantee implementation of the paris agreement. voicing concern about insufficient progress at the bangkok negotiations on implementation guidelines, he said the upcoming conference of the parties must be a success. the good news is that technology is on the side of progress, with the potential to create jobs and contribute to the global economy. the real danger is the risk of failing to act. governments must end fossil fuel subsidies and establish fair prices for carbon. “our future is at stake. climate change affects everything,” he said, announcing that he will convene a summit on climate change in september 2019 to mobilize action and financing one year before states are to revive their paris pledges. only a higher level of ambition will do, he said, adding: “the world needs you to be climate champions.” while new technologies hold great promise, they also pose risks and serious dangers, including criminal activity and disruption to labor markets, he continued. malicious acts in cyberspace, such as disinformation campaigns, are polarizing communities and diminishing trust among states. social media and the digital revolution are reinforcing tribalism and reinforcing a male-dominated culture. the technology sector must become more diverse, not least for its own benefit. with technology outpacing institutions, cooperation between states and stakeholders is crucial, he said, stressing the urgency to find and implement mutually beneficial solutions to digital challenges. further, the dangers of new technologies on warfare also need to be urgently addressed, particularly now that the prospect of weapons which can select and attack targets on their own could trigger a new arms race. “let’s call it as it is: the prospect of machines with the discretion and power to take human life is morally repugnant,” he said, warning that any new war could include a massive cyberattack against civilian infrastructure as well as military capacities. he urged the international community to use the united nations as a platform to nurture a digital future that is safe and beneficial for all. despite chaos and confusion in the world, there are winds of hope, he said, citing peace initiatives between eritrea and neighboring states, the signing of a peace agreement between the rival leaders of south sudan, and summit meetings between the leaders of the democratic people’s republic of korea and the united states and republic of korea. he also cited a strong commitment to peace in colombia, steps taken by greece and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia to resolve their differences, and peaceful political transitions in armenia, liberia and uzbekistan. approval of compacts on refugees and migrations is another sign of hope, while the drive for gender equality is gaining ground. “our future rests on solidarity,” he said. “we must repair broken trust. we must reinvigorate our multilateral project and we must uphold dignity for one and all.”"
Senegal,,"sidiki kaba, minister for foreign affairs of senegal, said he believed the theme of this year’s session was timely, relevant and provided an opportunity to take stock of collective action, especially in light of current global challenges that needed multilateralism to find solutions. the united nations is the embodiment of multilateralism and is the only forum where solutions can be arrived at as a common global family. however, he noted that there is a rising tide of pessimism and some accuse the united nations from deviating from its charter. against this backdrop, it must be proven the united nations is a vital platform for international affairs. to render the organization more effective it was essential to overcome ideological differences while promoting sustainable development and a world free of poverty, he said. he noted that sustainable development must be achieved in all facets — economic, social and political — and this must be the international community’s driving force. in this same vein, it is of paramount importance to finish the doha round to create mutually beneficial trade rules and set a fair price for commodities. moving on to the issue of climate change, he remained committed to the paris agreement. more financing is needed for the green climate fund; this will ensure that states can deal with climate change. in addition, it would be beneficial to strengthen international law in this field. he noted the need to complete reform processes as well as the need for political will to ensure the united nations can adapt to the new global political arena. in addition, he highlighted the fact that africa lacks a permanent seat on the security council. moving on to other issues, he said the adoption of a global compact on migration was more necessary than ever before, especially because migrants comprise 3 per cent of the global population. highlighting the attention given to the situation of women and girls, he noted his country’s robust plans and goal to emancipate women and girls. of importance is the issue of water, as senegal will host the world water forum; it is involved in numerous other water-related initiatives, including the united nations water task force on climate change. he underscored that the united nations represents the deepest desires of humankind and has historical responsibilities. in closing, he said: “i wish to echo the rallying cry of kofi annan, who said the united nations was important only as it could solve humankind’s problems. i urge the international community to be rallied permanently in achieving a better world for all.”"
Serbia,"ep blic of serbia general debate 73rd regular session of the general assembly of the united nations statement by h.e. ms. ana brnabic, prime minister of the republic of serbia new york, 26 september 2018 madam president, m . secretary-general, excellences, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to address you on behalf of the republic of serbia. first of all, i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate h.e. ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces, on the assumption of the presidency of the 73rd session of the general assembly of the united nations. i assure you, madam president, that serbia is deeply committed to advancing, in practice. the topics on this session s agenda: peaceful, equitable, and sustainable societies. having said that, i must also say that it is indeed a pleasure to see a fellow stateswoman presiding over this important institution. my congratulations are also due to h.e. r. miroslav lajcak for his stewardship of the 72nd session of the general assembly, as well as to h.e. mr. antonio guterres, secretary-general, for his en agement and commitment to promotin important reform processes within the un system. excellencies, i will not say anything new or original if i say that the world of today - be it europe, americas, asia, africa, australia - faces significant, and increasing, challenges: already grave consequences of climate change; migration; terrorism; the rise of populism; and greater divides between us, at a time when we need greater conver ence. we’ve all heard this throughout our discussions and from more than one leader durin the un general assembly debate. i will, however, say this: in looking for our way out of this and in striving to build a better world for all of us, we all need to start from ourselves and the thin s we must do by ourselves, first and foremost as individuals, then our countries, then our regions, then our continents and then the united world that e are. we, once more, need to start bringing the nations of the world together, much like 70 or so years ago. serbia is on the way of rethinking itself, as a prosperous, dynamic, creative, innovative, open society, within the united europe, that is whole, free, and at peace. i am often asked - when others are leaving european union, when so many are doubting the prospect of united europe - why would joining the eu be your first and fo emost strategic goal? and, i have often asked myself the same thing. and, in life, when you are not sure of answers, you go back to basics. you clea your head of the daily clutter, for et political misconceptions and spins, and think of basic values. that s where you get your answers from. the basic value of the european union, much like the basic value of the united nations, is: peace. it s not economy, or trade, or bi er market. it’s peace. all of these other things, and much, much more, came, and will always come, as a spillover effect of peace. european union was a peace project, and it is a successful one. and we want, we need, to be part of it - so there is sustainable peace, and consequently stability and prosperity, in the balkans - this troubled region of the world that used to be known as the powder keg of europe. i am extremely proud of what serbia has been able to achieve in the past four years. we’ve built macroeconomic stability and proved we are responsible and reliable partner. our economic activity has intensified, unemployment has more than halved compared to only four years a o, and we are seeing speedy recovery. today, serbia is one of the countries with the highest economic growth in europe, characterized by a substantial and ever greater influx of foreign investment. we’ve embarked on a comprehensive public administration reform with one simple goal: for it to become citizen-focused. we are reminding, on a daily basis, our administration, all of us, that we are there to serve, and not to be served. we are also working on strengthening the rule of law - through reforms of judiciary, working with media, establishing honest dialog with civil society organizations, building institutions to fight organized crime and corruption, ensuring fairness and justice for all. what we are doing is not easy and we are far from always bein successful, but it is a path to which we are fully committed. talking about things which are not easy, but for which one needs to take responsibility in order to build peace and prosperity in one s region, one’s continent, and one’s world, i cannot emphasize enough how important regional cooperation and stability is for serbia. and, here, we are talking about the region which has never, ever, been stable, or very predictable, or part of the world known for peace, reason and pragmatism. on the contrary. we’ve always been known for, and we’ve always been proud of, our excessive emotions, sacrifices, poetic struggles, traditional animosities. today, serbia is trying very hard to leave this in the past and grow to become more reasonable, instead of more emotional; more pragmatic, instead of immersed in myths; proud of its victories and not of its losses; a country which is building unexpected friendships, in place of traditional animosities. and i am proud to say that our pres dent has been leading the way in this internal strug le of ours to grow and mature; to leave the past behind and turn towards a much different future. first and foremost, i am addressin here the issue of our autonomous province of kosovo and metohija which split down the middle even the un - less than half of the un member countries recognize the unilateral declaration of independence of kosovo, while more than half, i.e. more than 5 billion people in the world, refuse to recognize the illegal secession of kosovo. what serbia has been trying to do in the past year, is essentially trying to close pandora s box which was opened 10 years ago when unilateral declaration of independence was proclaimed by authorities in pristina, and the rush by a number of countries in the world to recognize that unilateral declaration of independence regardless of international law and standards; regardless of the fact that this was done only 4 years after serbian churches and monasteries, world heritage sites, were looted and burned; and regardless of the fact that international community always stated standards before status as their mantra - and when everyone saw that standards are not on pristina’s agenda, they decided to break their own mantra and decide on the status. serbia of today is committed to peace and, if i may say so, behavin as an adult. we ve signed the brussels a reement more than five years ago, and implemented it. pristina signed it, but still did not implement even one single word of it. we will continue insisting on the full implementation of the brussels a reement and establishment of the community of serbian municipalities, but we will remain tolerant and patient. i can tell you today: however difficult, and difficult it is, however challen ing, and challenging it is; however sometimes hopeless and wasteful the dialog with pristina might be, we will stay committed to finding a compromise which will ensure sustainable peace, prosperity and brighter future for all people in the region. serbia will continue demonstrating readiness to compromise, which is far from easy; but in that we need a counterpart which is politically bold, responsible, committed and trustworthy, and that has not been the case thus far. i am therefore askin the international community to continue suppo ting the efforts that serbia initiated. to achieve progress in the dialog, we need undiluted and consistent support by the international community. your excellencies, serbia is committed to working with other nations across the globe on taking our common destiny , as many in the un refer to it, into our own hands. we want to claim accountability towards future generations. we want them to hold us accountable. that is why we are investing so much in peace, understanding and reconciliation in the region. and, on the other hand, we are equally investing in our future. the key priorities of my government are youth and education. we need to start teaching our youth how to think, and not what to think. not just serbia, but all of us, need to start investing more than ever before in education which will create more innovative, braver, more free-thinkin individuals who will then, in turn, create the world which is freer, fairer, and which is also, if i am to be honest, more fun. the world which will value people for who they are and the values and beliefs they stand for, rather than where they are from, what color is their skin, or who they love. serbia is very fortunate because we have a lot of people, especially young people, who are amongst the best in the world in creative thinking, video gaming, genome research, digital agriculture, animation, physics, machine engineering, blockchain, artificial intelligence, big dat analytics, maths, biology, software development and programming. our absolute key priority is to support them and to make sure we create a system, institutions, so that more of them can realize their full potential. not only that this will be the basis for the future growth of serbia, but perhaps more importantly, we hope to be able to empower them so that they will, together with others from all over, build a better world for all of us. without any doubt, our future is digital, and as general secretary gutteres said at the opening of the general debate, technology js on our side . although small, i believe serbia can and will play an important role in digital developments in the future which will help us deal with climate change, by far the biggest challenge ahead of us; alleviate hunger by increasing efficiency and making agriculture smarter; help with poverty reduction by ensurin easy access to finance even to the poorest, most disadvantaged ones, those which we cannot leave behind. this is how serbia sees its path to more peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. this is us, serbia, doing our bit for the better world. thank you.","ana brnabić, prime minister of serbia, saying at the outset it was a “pleasure to see a fellow stateswoman presiding over this important institution”, turned to a range of global challenges that require targeted action. climate change, migration, terrorism and the rise of populism must be addressed first by individuals, then at national, regional and global levels. stating she is often asked why serbia would strive to join the european union when others are leaving it, she answered that its basic value, like that of the united nations, is peace. the european union is important to forging sustainable peace, stability and prosperity in the balkans, “this troubled region of the world that used to be known as the powder keg of europe”, she said. expressing pride in serbia’s recent accomplishments, she pointed to macroeconomic stability, unemployment cut in half, and one of the highest economic growth rates in europe, with ever greater foreign investment. embarking on comprehensive public administration reform, she said her administration believes “we are there to serve, and not to be served”. the country is strengthening the rule of law through reforming the judiciary, working with media, establishing honest dialog with civil society organizations and building institutions to fight organized crime and corruption. strongly emphasizing the importance of regional cooperation and security to her country, she acknowledged that the area has always been known for and proud of “our excessive emotions, sacrifices, poetic struggles, traditional animosities”. however, today serbia is trying to leave that in the past and become more reasonable, pragmatic, proud of its victories rather than losses, and to build unexpected friendships. turning to the issue of kosovo, she pointed out that less than half of member states recognize the unilateral declaration of its independence, while more than half, representing 5 billion people, refuse to recognize its illegal secession. serbia is trying to “close pandora’s box”, which was opened a decade ago with this unilateral declaration of independence. underlining serbia’s commitment to peace and that it is “behaving as an adult”, she provided examples of how the country had advanced that concept. while serbia signed and implemented the brussels agreement more five years ago, priština had signed but has not yet implemented the accord. although dialog with priština was “sometimes hopeless and wasteful”, she stated serbia will remain committed to finding a compromise that will ensure sustainable peace, prosperity and a brighter future for all in the region. she asked the international community for undiluted and consistent support for serbia’s efforts. turning to youth, she said the entire international community must invest more than ever in education to create more innovative, braver, more free‑thinking individuals who will then create a world that is freer, fairer and even more fun. as a country with many young people, serbia makes it an absolute priority to support them, creating a system and institutions to enable them to reach their full potential."
Seychelles,"statement by h.e. r. danny faure president of the republic of seychelles at the general debate during the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly 25 september 2018 united nations headquarters new york your excellency president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly, your excellency, secretary-general of the united nations, distinguished heads of state and government, esteemed delegates, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor for me to address the 73rd sess on of the general assembly the same year we mark 100 years since the great nelson mandela s birth, a true son and leader of not just africa, but the world. madiba s legacy of democracy, equality, and peace are more relevant than ever amidst today s growing uncertainties. madame president, on behalf of the people of the republic of seychelles, it is a privilege to congratulate you on your election as president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. i wish you the very best as you discharge your important responsibilities. i would also like to congratulate your predecessor, his excellency miroslav lajcak, for his successful leadership of the general assembly in its 72nd session. i would also like to pay tribute to the statesmen and giants of history who have walked these halls, without whom our organization would not be what it is today - a symbol of unity and cooperation across al i the nations in the world. as we celebrate the anniversary of this great organization, let us pause and reflect on the true purpose that lies at the heart of the united nations. we must renew our commitment to not only the charter, but the founding principles, which must always guide us in our deliberations and actions. these values of cooperation are critical to the continued peace and prosperity of all our nations, and all our peoples. we cannot let these values come under threat. as a collective, we must continue to embrace multilateralism, which has underpinned the values of our orga nisation for nearly three quarters of a century. 1 seychelles continues to embrace the multilateral system that is the un, and we fully support the evolut on and progress that will come out of the un reform. this reform stresses the need for a more coordinated approach among the un country teams to successfully deliver the 2030 agenda and related sustainable de elopment goals. we give utmost importance to multilateral cooperation and in this spirit the government of seychelles and the un country team on the 30th of august this year, signed the first strategic partnership framework 2019-2023 which defines collective support from 18 u agencies. madame president, the challenges we face in the international system remain a poignant reminder of an evolving world to wh ch we must adapt to secure lasting peace and prosperity. without targeted approaches that touch the lives of our most vulnerable people, and fully embracing the promise of the sdgs, we run the risk of leaving some behind. strong institutions are essential to a vibrant democracy, where there is transparency and accountability to the people. my mandate as president of the republic of seychelles has been highlighted by, in part, my desire to ensure that our institutions not only ser e the people but grant them the necessary recourse should they feel the need. only throu h the strengthening of institutions and by binding ourselves to international law and norms can our people truly have accountable governments. i call on the advanced economies to support the strengthening of institutions in developing nations, not through handouts, but through the sharing of expertise and best practices for the benefit of all. qnly through the strengthening of institut ons can we assure respect for human rights, rule of law, and independent judiciaries, which will in turn ensure the future favors a vibrant democratic order. madame president, speaking from the standpoint of an islander, i cannot disassociate the concept of a lasting peace and prosperity from the perils of climate chan e. climate change has become an existential threat not only to the li es of people in island states, but the world as a whole. 2 as islanders, we live this stark reality every day. we see its effects n our eroding coastlines and unpredictable weather patterns. we see its effects on our coral reefs and rising sea levels. i recognize the need for development as a driving force to lift our people out of poverty, but we need to remain aware of its consequences on our planet and our future. through our neglect, we risk our children inheriting a planet beyond their capacity to repair. should we not uphold our commitments made, from paris to the fij cop23 in bonn last year, we will reach an inescapable crisis. i believe in the power of our collective efforts to shape a future of which we can all be proud. in this context, i would like'to draw your attention to the theme of our 73rd session, ""making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. the words sustainable societies has particular resonance for small island developing states. for our united nations to be a truly inclusive and keep up with the challenges of an ever-changing world, seychelles ali ns itself firmly with the african union position callin fpr a long overdue and comprehensive reform of the security council. this includes the equitable representation of africa which comprises, after all, more than a quarter of the members of the united nations. sustainability has always been and will continue to be at the heart of the development efforts of seychelles. as a nation, we have shown the world our commitment to this process. seychelles, alongside its fellow small island developing states, has been actively en a ed in this discourse to ensure that our concerns and needs are adequately addressed. our nation was forged by the ocean. we are acutely a are of the challenges that poses ith the threat of climate chan e. flowever, the ocean also presents a myriad of untapped opportunities. at the beginning of this year, seychelles pioneered a blue economy strategic policy framework and roadmap, to multiply the economic potential of our territorial waters whilst also protecting it for generations to come. for us, the blue economy is the next frontier of development. it is about oceanbased sustainable development focusing on economic diversification, shared prosperity, food security, and healthy and productive oceans. 3 it is encouraging to note that other like-minded states are developing this concept regardless of their geography. seychelles is shifting from a dependence on bilateral aid donors to developing innovative sources of financ n for our emerging blue economy. we are trying to leverage the wealth of the ocean that surrounds us and engage in exciting new partnerships. nevertheless, we reco nise this will not be enough to meet our all sustainable development and climate action obli ations under the 2030 a enda, the paris agreement, and the samoa pathway for sids. this is why seychelles is one of those small island developin states that continues to advocate for a sids-specific vulnerability and resilience index, which would take into account the unique vulnerabilities and specificities of small island developing states and better reflect the realities that we face. the agenda of small island developing states is inextricably linked to that of humanity s. madame president, the united nations was born of the horrors of a destructive world war. it was charged with upholding the idea that, as a collective, our differences could be resolved through dialog and international diplomacy. to ether, we continue to demonstrate the success and unrelenting power of diplomacy, and in the case of the smaller states like ours, we have also proven that might is not right. in this unique forum, we have equal representation. seychelles remains committed to the ideals of the united nations and will remain an active voice within this organization. today, we are presented with a unique opportunity to transform our world through our collective efforts, and create lasting partnerships. we have a unique opportunity to sculpt a future for our children they can be proud to inherit. let us be on the right side of history and live up to the ideals upon which this or anisation was born. thank you. 4","danny faure, president of seychelles, said that 100 years since the birth of nelson mandela, his legacy of democracy, equality and peace is more relevant than ever. he urged member states to reflect on the true purpose of the united nations and called for a renewed commitment to the organization’s charter and its founding principles. cooperation is critical to the continued peace and prosperity of all nations, he said. the international system faces challenges that require targeted approaches to benefit vulnerable populations and fully embrace the promises of the sustainable development goals, he continued. because strong institutions are essential to vibrant democracies and ensuring respect for international law, advanced economies should support the strengthening of institutions in developing countries through sharing of expertise and best practices. peace and prosperity cannot be disassociated from the effects of climate change and its existential threat to the world as a whole, he stressed. neglecting the effects of climate change will pass on to the next generation a world beyond repair. if states do not uphold climate commitments, they will face an inescapable crisis. turning to the theme of the seventy-third session of the general assembly — “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” — he said the words “sustainable societies” are particularly relevant to small island developing states. his country aligns itself with the african union in its call for united nations security council reform, including equitable representation of african states. on economic development, he said that seychelles pioneered a blue economy strategic framework and roadmap to multiply the potential of its territorial waters while also protecting them for future generations. the country is shifting from dependence on bilateral aid to developing innovative sources of financing for its emerging blue economy. as well, seychelles continues to call for a vulnerability and resilience index that accounts for the unique vulnerabilities of small island developing states, he said."
Sierra Leone,"permanent mission of the republic of sierra leone to the united nations 336 east 45th st., £lth floor • new york, ny 10017 statement by his excellency mr. julius maada bio president of the republic of sierra leone at the 73^^ session of the united nations general assembly thursday 27*^ september 2018 new york madam president, colleague heads of state and government, distinguished delegates, it is a distinct honor for me to address this august assembly for the very first time as president of the republic of sierra leone. i warmly congratulate you, madam president, on your election as president of the 73*""^ session of the united nations general assembly. i want to assure you of my country's fullest support and cooperation during your tenure. i commend your predecessor, his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak of serbia for his sterling leadership during the 72""^ session. i would also like to commend the secretary-general, his excellency mr. antonio guterres, for his dedication and commitment to the pursuit of world peace and development. on behalf of the government and people of sierra leone, i extend heartfelt condolences to the government and people of ghana and to the united nations family on the passing of mr. kofi annan, former secretary-general of the united nations. he served humanity and the world with distinction, and in our country's hour of need, he helped steer our nation out of the deep abyss of seemingly intractable war. may he rest in perfect peace. he always showed us what is possible and what is best in humanity. madam president, our commitment to building a peaceful and more secure world, as espoused in the united nations charter, as well as, our commitment to the implementation of agenda 2030, the paris agreement on climate change, and on-going reform processes of the united nations, resonates with the theme ^^making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for feacefuly equitable and sustainable societies. the work of the united nations should continue to be guided by the values on which it was founded, including, promoting peace, security, human rights, equality of all nations, and the promotion of social progress and better standards of life. madam president, in april this year. sierra leoneans registered their commitment to democratic governance with yet another peaceful transfer of power from an incumbent political party to the opposition. we acknowledge with humility the many messages of commendation from various parts of the world for conducting peaceful and credible presidential, parliamentary and local councils elections, which led to my election as president. on behalf of the people of sierra leone, we sincerely appreciate invaluable contributions of the international community in facihtating and monitoring our electoral process. we acknowledge the role of the united nations and our development partners for supporting the successful conduct of those elections. we are a successful model of a stable democracy - one that has evolved and matured in 20 years from the chaos and lawlessness of civil conflict. but stable democracies must be sustainable. sierra leoneans voted for a change of government; they voted for a new direction and the right direction. my government is ready to maximize our country's potential for development because we believe that development sustains emerging, successful, and stable democracies like ours. the international community has invested hugely in facilitating and stabilizing sierra leone's democracy. the international community must continue to play its role in sustaining sierra leone's democracy in collaboration with the government and people of sierra leone. in particular, we acknowledge the support of undf and uncdf for their support for our economic transformation. in addition to our firm commitment to good governance and prudent and accountable management of our nation's resources, we are ready to foster a conducive and congenial environment for credible gdp growth. we call on our bilateral partners to help us deliver on the expectations of our people with development funds, technical assistance, and the cultivation of valuable trade links. we cordially invite all credible investors into an open and congenial investment environment where all your investments are guaranteed and protected by our relevant laws and where we have worked assiduously to remove barriers to investment. help us to sustain our stable democracy. madam president, this assembly made a historic pledge during the world summit held in 2005: a pledge ^ strengthen the united nations with a view to enhancing its authority andefficiency, as wellasits capacityto address effectively, andin accordance with the purposes andprinciples of the charter, the full range of challenges of our time"". a number of gains have been made, including the establishment of the peacebuilding commission and the human rights council, and the adoption of the resolution on responsibility to protect. these gains are laudable, but the need for reform is urgent and imperative. we should now endeavor to demonstrate the political will to particularly redress the historical injustice done to the african continent. the present geopolitical realities are compelling for a comprehensive reform of the security council to make way for equitable representation in all organs of the united nations. africa is the only region without representation in the permanent category of the security council. africa is also under-represented in the non-permanent category. africa's demand for two permanent seats with all the rights and prerogatives of current members, including the right of veto, and two additional non-permanent seats is a matter of common justice, and the right to have an equal say in decisionmaking on issues that affect the ajprican region. it is time that we addressed this longstanding injustice and imbalance perpetuated in the present configuration of the security council without any further delay. africa is committed to on-going reforms that will make the united nations fit for purpose. as the coordinator of the african union committee of ten heads of state and government on the reform of the united nations, we reiterate our concern over the continuous inaction of this body to adopt measures that will lead to africa taking its rightful place in the security council. unless we are able to contend with the reform of the security council - the most critical question of the day - our organization will be seemingly constituted on undemocratic and discriminatory principles. let me reiterate the urgent need for comprehensive reform of the security council. 1.2 billion of the world's population of 7.5 billion are african. 1.2 billion of the world's population continues to contribute its fair share to maintaining world peace and security. about 70% of the decisions made at the un security council ultimately affect those 1.2 billion africans. those 1.2 billion people are affected by over 70% of the un's resolutions. 1.2 billion of the world's population therefore asks why it should be excluded from representation on the un security council. those 1.2 billion people simply want their voices to be fully represented on the un security council. madam president, my government's blueprint document for moving our country forward - the ""new direction"" - focuses on taking sierra leone beyond the phase of peacebuilding and consolidation to firmly establishing a stable, peaceful, open, and pluralistic democracy that is a responsible and committed member of the community of nations. atthe domestic level, my government has established priority areas including job creation; access to quality education; youth empowerment, empowerment of women and the disabled; combating graft and corruption and fostering a culture of accountability and transparency; ensuring effective and efficient public service delivery; and strengthening civic responsibility and national cohesion. guided by both our specific situation and sustainable development goals (sdgs), our governance initiative and policy actions involve strengthening our democratic institutions, opening up democratic spaces, promoting democratic dialogs, and creating a more just and equal society. we see these as precursors for the sustainable growth of our economy and our development as a nation. my government's economic and development policies, as i stated inter-alia, create a congenial environment for credible private sector investment and entrepreneurship. we are eager to work with and listen to the private sector. our policies are enabling and our investment framework is attractive. we can ensure the full legal protection of all investments and we can ensure predictable and profitable revenue streams and returns on investments. sierra leone is at the beginning of adopting renewable energy. we now need public and private investment for commercial and industrial use, powering hotels, agriculture, and small-scale manufacturing. my country is endowed with significant renewable energy resources in solar irradiation, coastal and offshore wind, mini-hydro, and bioenergy. my government's target of 60% renewable energy capacity by 2030 is practicable especially to generate growth in rural areas. our country, like most developing countries, has been on the expensive and dirty hquid fuel treadmill since independence. my government is seeing international technical assistance and capacity building for migrating a percentage of my country's power-generation away from heavy liquid fuel to liquid natural gas (lng) trucked to site. my government is seeking collaboration between local companies and us engineering companies that have proven experience in working on powerafrica funded lng-fower projects in africa. we believe that investment in renewable energy sources and lng will help us meet sdg 7 by modernizing our energy generation systems and this will have a multiplier effect in helping our country meet sdgs for poverty alleviation through job creation and increased investments, health delivery, water, and cities. we are determined to make sierra leone the renewable energy hub of the egowas regional block. our vision is good for our world's climate, good for foreign and local investors and development, and good for our country. my government has a bold vision for science, technology, and innovation. i have established the first directorate of science technology, and innovation we have set a bold and achievable target of 2025 for developing solid ict infrastructure that will support graft-free governance and the delivery of effective, reliable, responsive, and transparent services from banking and business to education. agricultural extension, revenue collection, healthcare delivery, access to justice, governance, tourism, trade, and the rule of law. madam president, we have undertaken extensive reforms in line with sdg 16 plus to create a peaceful, just, and inclusive sierra leone with resilient institutions. we are engaged in judiciary and criminal justice reform and in collaboration with civil society and partner organizations, we continue to build on gains injustice delivery that take into account disparities in access to justice. we have launched a focused and sustained campaign against graft and waste and misuse of public funds. our national revenue authority has streamlined revenue collection and reduced tax evasion and theft. we have launched a free quality education program that provides access to basic through secondary education for the girl child and other children of school-going age. we are building, re-tooling, and opening up our governance, healthcare, financial, and other institutions to empower our women, young persons, the aged, and disabled compatriots. we are also reviewing discriminatory laws and practices and we will engage communities in order to change traditional strictures that have excluded those persons. in particular, our young people, like young people the world over are energized and eager to make sierra leone a better place. our development policies and priorities harness their vibrancy and direct it into targeted education and skills training, entrepreneurship, and strong civic participation. we are working toward a comprehensive biometric identification system so that all citizens can fully participate in the economic and civic life of our nation. in particular, we acknowledge the support of undp, kiva and uncdf in strengthening our national digital identification system. their assistance modernizes our credit reference bureau that will radically transform the financial inclusion landscape and the ease of doing business in our country. we are fully committed to promoting a free press, rescinding adversarial public order laws, and protecting and promoting the right of citizens to know and to access information. we have instituted a national civic education commission to further ensure the unrestricted participation of every sierra leonean in our stable democracy. for all of the foregoing, we need a constructive but intensive and sustained engagement with our bilateral partners and partner institutions. madam president, my government is committed to increasing equitable access to quality healthcare for sierra leoneans. we call on bilateral partners, organizations, private persons to help us invest in and also develop our critical institutional, technical, human resource capacity, as well as develop infrastructure that ensures the delivery of quality healthcare for sierra leoneans. we recall with great appreciation the magnanimity of the world as we dealt with recent deadly epidemics like the ebola virus disease, and the sustained interventions of our partners in helping us battle tropical diseases including malaria, cholera, and typhoid. we need more help in all those areas and in expanding and maintaining all immtmization levels at a 100%. my government has increased healthcare investment. but that will not be enough. we call on the international commimity to enhance our institutional and technical capacity for preventative healthcare, and for managing public health and environmental sanitation issues including waste management and storm drain water management in urban areas. madam president, sierra leone welcomes the un's renewed commitment to conflict prevention as embodied in its charter. the world, more now than ever before, needs a stronger united nations and consistent and effective multilateralism that collectively ponders and cooperatively resolves mankind's common challenges from trade to climate change, and from world security to our common humanity, and our collective social and economic well-being. our foreign policy should be driven by the golden rule, impartiality, and cooperation. this is the only way humanity can respond effectively, without hesitation, to the global challenges that we face. we acknowledge the continued relevance of the program of action and the international tracing instrument, which constitutes the global framework to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. we welcome the secretary-general's reform agenda in sustaining peace, including the efforts to reform peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools available to the un in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security. my government will bolster sierra leone's participation in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security as a troop and police contributing country and supporting un peacekeeping operations, especially with the deployments of formed units or contingents of both military and police. sierra leone stands ready to continue contributing to world peace and security. madam president, with a strong belief in a shared vision and a common destiny. sierra leoneans stand with the world in meeting the world's challenges. sierra leoneans equally look to the world for all the help the world can offer to help consolidate sierra leone into an economically developed, open, inclusive, and pluralistic democracy. we are ""one, with a faith that wisdom inspires; one, with a zeal that never tires."" . » r we are optimistic because our country stands ready on the threshold of a newdirection. i thank you for your attention.","julius maada bio, president of sierra leone, said his country’s commitment to the united nations charter and the building of a more secure world resonates with the theme of this year’s general assembly debate. sierra leone recently demonstrated its commitment to democratic governance with yet another peaceful transfer of power from an incumbent political party to the opposition, he said, thanking the international community for facilitating and monitoring the electoral process. his country stands ready to maximize its potential for development and he called on bilateral partners to help deliver on the expectations of the people of sierra leone. since the general assembly’s 2005 pledge to strengthen the united nations and enhance its authority and efficiency, some gains have been made, he continued. however, the need for reform remains urgent and member states must work to redress the historical inequalities done to african countries. present geopolitical realities are compelling for a comprehensive reform of the security council, he said, pointing out that africa is the only region without permanent representation and underrepresented in the non-permanent category. the united nations will be undemocratic and discriminatory if security council reform is not addressed. he said sierra leone’s blueprint for progress focuses on taking the country beyond the phase of peacebuilding and consolidation, and firmly establishing a stable and pluralistic democracy. the government emphasizes job creation, access to quality education, youth empowerment, empowerment of women, combating corruption and fostering a culture of accountability and transparency. grounded in the sustainable development goals, sierra leone’s policy actions involve strengthening democratic institutions, opening democratic spaces, promoting democratic dialog and creating a more just and equal society. sierra leone is in the opening stages of adopting renewable energy, he said, pointing to the need for increased public and private investment in the industry. its target of 60 per cent renewable energy capacity by 2030 is practicable, especially to generate growth in rural areas. investment in renewable energy will have a multiplier effect in helping the country achieve goal 7, he said, adding that sierra leone has a bold vision for science, technology and innovation. he highlighted how sierra leone is undertaking extensive reform to create a peaceful, just and inclusive environment. the government has launched a free education program and is retooling its governance and financial and health‑care institutions. on health care, he called on international partners to help invest in critical institutional, technical and human resources and to help improve the country’s preventative health infrastructure. welcoming the united nations renewed commitment to conflict prevention and acknowledging the relevance of the global framework to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit arms trade, he also called on the international community to help consolidate sierra leone’s development efforts."

mfa.gov.sg/newyork speech by minister for foreign affairs of the republic of singapore • dr vivian balakrishnan at the 73rd session of the un general assembly new york, 29 september 2018 madam president excellencies distinguished delegates 1. i congratulate her excellency maria fernanda espinosa of ecuador on her election as president of the 73rd session of the general assembly. i also thank his excellency miroslav lajcak, the foreign minister of slovakia, for his leadership of the 72nd session. madam president, 2. multilateralism is at a crossroads. in recent years, we have witnessed a crisis of confidence in the concept of multilateralism and its institutions. whether in trade, security or dispute resolution, questions have arisen about whether the multilateral system can continue to deliver ef ective solutions for our problems. as a small, open and trade-dependent state, singapore has watched this recent retreat from multilateralism with grave conce . this is why i want to mount a defense of multilateralism today. there is perhaps no better forum for me to make this argument than here at the un, the ultimate bastion of multilateralism. 3. it is easy to understand why there is a resurgence in isolationist, protectionist and xenophobic sentiments in the political arena all over the world. we are living in volatile, uncertain and disruptive times. the digital revolution is increasingly disrupting the way we live, work, play, communicate and organize our societies. non-state actors and transboundary threats such as terrorism, infectious pandemics and climate change remain a clear and present danger. frontier issues such as artificial intelligence and cybercrime have leapt from the pages of science fiction. social cohesion is breaking down. 4. at the same time, the international order as we know it is also being disrupted. since 1945, many countries and regions have benefitted from the open 1 and inclusive global order that was substantially underwritten by a single power - the united states. today, we are transitioning into a multipolar world, where other powers are starting to assume a greater role in various spheres. this is a transition that has to be managed carefully. importance of rules-based multilateral system 5. i am not saying that multilateralism is perfect. in fact, we need to recognize that it hasn t always fulfilled all its promises. and sometimes, it has been over-sold as a panacea. how then do we make multilateralism wor in this shifting geostrategic context? 6. my take is that every state has to make room to accommodate new realities and find a new modus vivendi. foreign policy and trade policy always begin at home. politics is always local. the global order will need to evolve and our roles and responsibilities will need to be rebalanced. in this perilous period of transition, we cannot and should not abandon the mles-based world order that has brought about unprecedented peace and prosperity for 70 years. 7. in fact, the scale and transboundary nature of the challenges we face today demand more cohesion nd cooperation. there is a strong case to be made for doubling down on multilateralism, rather than retreating from it. we need a clear framework of rules and norms to ensure predictability and stability in inter¬ state relations and commerce. defining these mles through a multilateral process in which all states engage one another as equals, is necessary to build consensus and respect for the rule of law. 8. compliance with the agreed rules by all states is not only essential for global stability and the governing of the global commons, but is especially important to small states such as singapore. the principle that agreements will be respected and implemented is fundamental for our survival. without the rule of law, the strong do what they will, and the weak suffer what they must . small states like singapore will not survive in such a world. that is why singapore has been a staunch defender of the un, inte ational law and the multilateral system. 9. take trade for example. globalization has not benefitted everyone equally. pockets of poverty and hunger continue to persist around the world. our people are worried about jobs. unfortunately, the conventional arguments in favor of free trade, economic integration, and cooperation between countries have gone out of fashion. today, trade frictions between the us and china have raised the specter of a trade war. 2 10. we cannot simply blame globalization. govern e ts of the day have an obligation to consider long-term and sustainable solutions, instead ofjust raising trade barriers. for example, to truly address widening inequality and wage stagnation, we must address its root causes. in the midst, of the digital revolution, we must ensure that our people have the right skills for new emerging jobs. it is futile to fight to protect obsolete technologies and yesterday s jobs. on the contrary, we must try to take advantage of the new opportunities of the global market to create the jobs of the future. it is thus our responsibility, as govern ents, to actively put in place policies to train, retool and reskill our citizens by investing in infrastructure, training and education. this is why singapore is restructuring our education system. we are putting in serious money to enable our people to continuously upgrade and learn new skills through a program we call skillsfuture. our focus is to restructure our economy - to identify and work with the private sector to transform jobs, enhance our competitiveness and elevate productivity. this is fundamentally an investment in our people to make sure that they are ready for the future. 11. ultimately, no country benefits from trade conflicts and protectionism. the negative impacts will ripple through the global supply chain and undermine growth and prosperity in all countries. at a time of increasing inter-connectedne and inter-dependence, it is now more than ever that we need a multilateral approach and strong mles. singapore will continue to be a strong supporter of the rules-based multilateral trading system. the critical importance of the world trade organization camiot be over-emphasized, as the neutral arbiter of inte ational trade disputes. developing rules and norms to govern cyberspace 12. another area where we urgently need to promote the adoption and implementation of mles and norms is in cyberspace. to reap the full benefits of digital technologies, we must develop a tmsted and open cyberspace underpinned by inte ational law and well-defined nor s of responsible state behavior. 13. the inte ational telecommunications union ranked singapore as the country most committed to cybersecurity in its 2017 global cybersecurity index. yet, in july this year, one of singapore’s health databases was subject to an advanced persistent threat. this was a deliberate, targeted and sophisticated cyber-attack. this shows that no country is i mune to cyber-attacks. 14. all states must work together to implement norms and rales prohibiting such attacks on critical infrastructure. as the only universal, inclusive, multilateral forarp, states have always turned to the un to develop the rales that gove the global commons. one example is the un convention on 3 the law of the sea (unclos), which provides the global legal framework for all activities in the oceans and seas. 15. just as we supported the unclos process, singapore stands ready to contribute to the un s work to develop and adopt norms and rules on cybersecurity. to this end, we support the reconvening of the un group of governmental experts (gge) and the continuation of its work in developing the norms of state behavior in cyberspace. 16. cybersecurity has been a priority under singapore’s chairmanship of the association of southeast asian nations (asean). at the 3rd asean mini terial conference on cybersecurity in singapore last week, asean agreed to subscribe in-principle to the 11 norms in the un gge’s 2015 report. 17. singapore is also committed to capacity building which is essential for states to effectively implement rules and norms of state behavior. singapore will launch an asean-singapore cybersecurity center of excellence in 2019. we have also partnered with the un office for disarmament affairs (unoda) on a u -singapore cyber program to raise awareness and build capacity in our region. regional cooperation in support of multilateralism: asean 18. our work in asean is rooted in our belief that regional organizations can demonstrate how multilateralism can continue to be relevant and beneficial to all our peoples. 19. as the asean chair this year, singapore will continue to work with asean member states and our exte al partners to ensure that the regional architecture remains open, inclusive and mles-based. 20. we are w rking with our partners to conclude the regional comprehensive economic partnership (rcep). when concluded, the rcep will be the world’s largest trading bloc, covering a third of the world’s gdp. but this is not just about big trade figures. it will send a powerful message that asean member states and our partners are committed to free trade, regional integration and inte ational cooperation. 21. asean member states are also working together to leverage the digital revolution for our peoples’ benefit. we established the asean smart cities network (ascn) at the 32nd asean summit in april. the ascn focuses on ensuring interoperability and integration of services, and allows cities in the region to share experiences, exchange solutions and lessons leamt. we have 4 just concluded an asean agreement on streamlining e-commerce regulations so that businesses can market and sell their products easily within asean. 22. asean member states are also committed to the peacef l resolution of disputes through multilateral processes. the situation in rakhine state in myanmar is a grave conce . the crisis is complex and deep-rooted and will not be resolved ove ight. there are accounts of brutal and shocking atrocities. we condemn all human rights violations. we expect the independent commission of enquiry established by the government of myanmar to carry out impartial investigations expeditiously and hold those responsible fully accountable. the voluntary return of displaced persons to myanmar in a safe, secure and dignified way should commence without undue delay. ultimately, a political solution needs to be found, involving reconciliation, fairness, justice, and better prospects for all communities. only then can there be a durable solution to this complex inter-communal problem. singapore s contributions to support the un and multilateralism 23. we have all been watching developments on the korean peninsula with concern. this year, singapore was able to make a small contribution towards easing tensions when we hosted the summit between the us and dprk leaders in june. the summit, as well as the three inter-korean dialogs held this year, are important steps towards lasting peace and stability on the korean peninsula. singapore hopes that dialog and efforts towards peace will continue. 24. let me conclude by saying that there is no doubt that multilateralism needs to be defended and the un strengthened to deal with complex global challenges. as members of the un, we each have a responsibility to work together, to improve and adapt the multilateral system we have built painstakingly over the last seven decades. we owe it to our people to find solutions and to build consensus, so that our people can lead better lives. ultimately, a rules-based multilateral system is indispensable to secure peace and prosperity for our people and our planet. 5","vivian balakrishnan, minister for foreign affairs of singapore, noting that multilateralism is at a crossroad, acknowledged that sometimes, it has been oversold as a panacea. nonetheless, in this perilous period of transition for the international community, he emphasized that “we cannot abandon the rules‑based world order that has brought about unprecedented peace and prosperity for seventy years”. compliance with agreed rules is not only essential for global stability and the governing of the global commons, but also for the survival of small states such as his. globalization has not benefited everyone equally and pockets of poverty and hunger continue to persist around the world. further, frictions between the united states and china have raised the specter of a trade war. the negative impacts of protectionism will ripple through the global supply chain and undermine growth, he cautioned. noting the urgent need to promote the adoption of rules and norms in cyberspace, he urged the international community to develop a trusted and open cyberspace underpinned by international law. the international telecommunication union (itu) had ranked singapore as the country most committed to cybersecurity in its 2017 global cybersecurity index; yet in july, one of singapore’s health databases was subject to a deliberate, targeted and sophisticated cyberattack. his country was ready to contribute to the organization’s work in developing norms and rules on cybersecurity, and especially supported the reconvening of the united nations group of government experts and the continuation of its work. turning to regional cooperation, he added that as chair of the association of southeast asian nations (asean) this year, singapore will continue to work with partners to ensure that the regional architecture remains open, inclusive and rules‑based. member states of that regional group are committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes through a multilateral process. expressing concern about the situation in rakhine state in myanmar and condemning all human rights violations, he noted that the crisis is complex and deeply rooted and will not be resolved overnight. the independent commission of enquiry established by that country’s government must carry out impartial investigations. in addition, the voluntary return of displaced persons to myanmar in a safe, secure and dignified way should commence without delay, he urged. turning to the developments on the korean peninsula, he noted his country’s small contribution towards easing tension by hosting the summit between the united states’ and the democratic people’s republic of korea’s leaders in june. the summit, as well as the three inter‑korean dialogs held this year are important steps towards lasting peace and stability on the korean peninsula. as members of the united nations, he concluded, all states have a responsibility to work together to improve and adapt the multilateral system built painstakingly over the last seven decades. “we owe it to our people, to find solutions and to build

Slovakia,"statement by h. e. mr. andrej kiska president of the slovak republic in the general debate of the 73^^ session of the united nations general assembly madam president of the general assembly, mr. secretary-general, distinguished heads of state and government, excellences, ladies and gentlemen, it takes decades to build peace and trust. but it takes seconds, one selfish or narrow-minded decision, to break them. we gather here every year to enhance what we have been building for over 70 years. an idea of world based on rules and principles of humanity, responsibility, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence. where wars and armed conflicts have no place. where disputes are solved in dialog. and where challenges are addressed in cooperation. we are continually becoming wealthier and more advanced. with all the resources we can generate together, we may have all the means to reach even the poorest of the poor. and yet, we are more often driven by selfishness and short-term interests. instead of enlarging freedom, cooperation and healthy competition, we introduce restrictions and trade wars. while globalization has created unprecedented wealth, inequalities are still dividing this planet. the economic figures are positive, but they get hardly translated into improved well-being and dignity of every human being in many parts of our world. in an amazing pace we continue developing technologies which allow us to connect, communicate and be closer globally. but the distance between people, the gap in understanding and empathy towards other cultures are still huge. and yet, thanks to innovations the world has never been smaller. what happens thousands of kilometers far from us can turn into a global problem in a matter of minutes. the global problems have direct impacts on our citizens. in this situation, the united nations plays an irreplaceable role. it has an enormous potential to overcome these paradoxes. its strong principles, responsible action and the driver for cooperation are what makes it so unique. let me touch upon these in more detail. the rules and principles and their enforcement must remain a backbone of this organization. because today it seems that playing by the rules have become old-fashioned. as if ignoring them was a sign of strength. and respect a sign of weakness. the number of armed conflicts has increased in the recent years. only in 2016 and 2017 the number of conflicts reached the peaks of the cold war era. the civilian casualties rise. we are talking about hundreds of thousands of innocent people directly affected by conflicts and wars. sovereignty and territorial integrity are the dna of stability and security — globally and regionally. but the occupation of georgia and ukraine and destabilization in the region are just one of many examples that the respect of rules is being replaced by ruthless power politics. the threat of nuclear weapons resonates much more often than we could have imagined in the past years. we hope that the current developments in north korea will bring tangible results. we must make sure the agreements will be kept. and if not, we need to act with resolve. too often we see thousands of civilians massacred by their very own regimes or in endless conflicts. as if we became immune to the breaching of the very norms of humanity and stopped counting the innocent lives in syria, yemen, palestine, myanmar, south sudan and elsewhere. together we have agreed that using the weapons of mass destruction will be unacceptable without exceptions. any use of chemical weapons must be a red line to our tolerance. an automatic trigger for resolute actions. so it is shameful to see repeated use of chemical weapons against own citizens for the sake of survival of a tyranny in syria. or for us, europeans, shockingly, the attacks in salisbury in great britain with the perpetrators avoiding responsibility and shamelessly denying facts. it is our responsibility to make sure that no perpetrator will escape unpunished. we must firmly show that we do not bent our principles to aggressive politics. that we will not undermine the authority of this organization by inaction. we have a great responsibility towards our citizens, towards international community and this planet. to lead, to stand firmly behind our values, to defend them. we must listen to our people to address their problems. but also to see far enough to inspire them. particularly vis-a-vis extremism, populism, radicalism, xenophobia or racism. propaganda, lies and twisted truths. or terrorism. their goals are simple and yet effective — to spread fear, hatred and doubts. to erode our beliefs and values. to undermine our unity. they provide seemingly quick and simple solutions provoking confrontation and drawing dividing lines. it is no surprise they find a fertile soil everywhere we fail to deliver. people living in poverty, starving of hunger or diseases, with no access to education or health care, are one of their natural targets. and we will not win this fight if we do not offer these people and their children a hope to live a better life in dignity, free of fear of hunger or death. that is why our unity in implementing the development goals, in fighting the climate change or addressing migration is so important. we need to turn our plans and our promises into a global reality. failing to do so only sends a signal of our weakness, leaving these people and this planet as an easy prey. 8 unprecedented progress in innovations and new technologies brings new challenges. i am very much concerned about malicious activities in cyber space. growing manipulation in social media is undermining democracy worldwide and indoctrinating our populations. cyber space knows no borders. it is anonymous and provides unlimited room to strike at us. the choice of means is endless. to manipulate elections, to influence decisions. to spy on us or sneak into our computers, networks and everyday lives. it is as dangerous as any conventional threat. as such it requires our utmost attention. but we don't do anything yet or barely a little. the global companies prefer their profits to their responsibilities. so it is up to us, the states, to set new standards and where needed, regulations. because today we dont lead. we only follow. and the price of inaction may be soon very high. too often, we hear political leaders calling to fight extremism and propaganda with the same tools and rhetorics. they can't be more wrong. the only honest answer is to support tolerance, freedom of speech and critical thinking in our societies. the only potent defense is to reinforce our values and to bring candid solutions to people's problems. only when we deliver, our electoral constituencies may become immune to extremist ideas and propaganda. in this effort, we need to remember that free media are our allies not enemies. they are guardians of our principles. they are often the first to spot when things go in the wrong direction. they keep those, who break the rules, accountable. 10 thus we should be very much worried about increased attacks on journalists, attempts to eliminate the freedom of press and growing restrictions on civil societies. sadly, last year dozens of journalists were killed. hundreds were imprisoned and thousands oppressed. the climate of hate continues to spread portraying them as enemies of the state, as the enemies of nation or faith. but they play a key role in our mission for the better world. and as such they must be protected. 11 cooperation none of our countries, even the most powerful ones, is big enough to face the current challenges on its own. be it migration, terrorism, climate change or solid economic growth. while our most important duty of us, the politicians, is to serve our people, it will only be possible if we truly understand the value of cooperation. if we understand that if we truly want to change this world and this planet for better, we need to think of others - individuals, nations, and countries. and patiently explain this principle to our people. 12 as kofi annan said: ""more than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. we can master it only ifweface it together. and that, myfriends, is why we have the united nations."" i admit that multilateralism is not always an easy way. but it is the only sustainable one. the united nations will serve its purpose as long as we, the member states, stand true to our commitments. for as long as we respect the rules and principles and will be ready to defend them. because the noble idea and strong principles of this organization the true values of tolerance, empathy, compassion and solidarity are the best equipment for us to face any challenge. if we protect these values — the moral compass of humanity, then the evil of aggressive power politics, selfish nationalism, extremism or racism shall not prevail. 13 we may not know what comes tomorrow. but we may know how to respond if we let the moral compass guide us. and it is the best assurance we can have in the times of uncertainty. to protect our values. madam president, 1wish to conclude by congratulating you on your assumption of the presidency. the challenges 1spoke about are not easy to tackle. but 1 have full confidence in the united nations and your office that you will steer this assembly through these times with utmost dedication to fulfill our common goals. for what 1also wish to proudly thank and congratulate to your predecessor mr. miroslav lajcak — for a professionalism with which he served the united nations and its peoples. thank you.","andrej kiska, president of slovakia, said “we are more often driven by selfishness and short-term interests,”

Slovenia,,"borut pahor, president of slovenia, said that the case for multilateralism is clear. “no state, no nation will gain if it only strives to assert its own interests,” he continued. slovenia stands firm in defense of multilateralism with the united nations, committed to the multifaceted system based on shared values, rule of law and human rights. respect for international law and rule of law is a precondition to peace and security. as a country in the western balkans region, slovenia stresses the importance of international law and the judgements of international courts relating to the region’s reconciliation process, he said. recognizing and accepting historic facts no matter how painful are the basis for stability and progress. “the western balkans are in need of both,” he emphasized, expressing support to the euro‑atlantic membership perspective in the region. solutions must be wise, comprehensive and highly responsible, rather than cause a domino effect and negative impact. the united nations has been instrumental in promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms worldwide, he said. no rights of states, no emergency, no political reasons can ever excuse violations of human rights. he expressed hope that the united states, a traditional promoter and supporter of human rights, will remain committed to this ideal. war, violence, extremism and terrorism always present grievous assaults on human rights. he called on all to work together to foster a culture of mutual respect for diversity. he said that impunity represents one of the major obstacles to the prevention of grave and systematic violations of human rights. “ending impunity is essential for the war-torn society to recover,” he added, expressing strong support for the international criminal court. he noted the conflicts in syria, humanitarian disasters in yemen and afghanistan, growing regional tensions in the sahel, continued violence in libya, and the refugee crises in myanmar and venezuela. “we need to face these crises with determination,” he said. slovenia supports solving the pressing proliferation issues through diplomatic means, he said, reiterating support to the joint comprehensive plan of action. he underscored that special attention should be paid to the prevention of sexual abuse and exploitation, including in armed conflicts. sexual and gender‑based violence presents a barrier to women’s participation in peace and post‑conflict activities. he expressed support for the 2030 agenda and working together in cooperation and partnership to achieve myriad global goals."
Solomon Islands,"solomon islands government ¦ statement by the hon. rick n. houenipwela, mp 73rd united nations gener l assembly deb te making the united n tions relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies friday, 28th september, 2018 new york l madam president excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, at the outset, allow me, on behalf of my government and the people of solomon islands, to con ey our warmest greetings, to you madam president and the members of this august assembly.. our warmest congratulations to you madam president/on your election as president of the 73rd session of the general assembly. i am confident, that under your leadership, you will ably guide our deliberations during this current session. madam president, i assure you of my delegation s full support and cooperation during your tenure in office. i also commend and thank your predecessor his excellency miroslav lajcak, for his sterling stewardship of the 72nd session of the general assembly, and, we thank him for his leadership. solomon islands also joins other members in mourning the loss of the late koffi anan, former secretary general of the united nations and a proud son of ghana and africa. we acknowledge his immense contributions to the work of our organization. the late kofi anan was truly a global statesman. madam president, i welcome the theme chosen for this session. it reflects the ultimate goal that this august body strives to achieve. making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful equitable and sustainable societies. 2 this is indeed a powerful theme. it speaks of a united world with both equal responsibilities and equal opportunities. it also speaks of the need to be united in achieving peace and tranquility amongst all our nations and peoples. indeed, madam president, the implementation of the sdgs requires a unified global partnership and the concerted joint efforts of all stakeholders to mobilize all available resources to achieve these sdgs. it recognizes that by being together we can conquer the inequities of today that have befallen us, be it man-made or natural. it also reflects the preamble of the un charter which speaks powerfully of our mission to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women, and of nations large and small."" our preamble clearly articulates the principle of universality, for all peoples and all nations regardless of their size. madam president, the world has, unfortunately, entered an era, in which the foundation and strengths of multilateralism is being challenged and undermined by unilateral state posturing and maneuvers. we have seen a proliferation of insular focussed policies by some countries, causing them to renege on their commitments under various international frameworks and treaties. 3 the united nations allows us to consolidate our collective resolve and solidarity for maintenance of international peace and security; promote sustainable development advance respect for human rights and promote the rule of law. sdgs madam president, solomon islands reaffirms its commitment to achieving the sdgs by 2030. to this end, we have incorporated the sdgs into our national development strategy 2016-2035. we also welcome the mid-term review of the small islands developing states (sids] accelerated modalities of action (samoa) pathway. it is my hope, that the outcomes of the review will provide the impetus needed to reinvigorate the speci l case for sids going forward. the review should also ensure that all partners and stakeholders, together with sids, address, more effectively, challenges faced by sids and take full advantage of the opportunities through genuine and durable partnerships. solomon islands acknowledges, that achieving the sdgs will be an arduous and challenging task. however, it is a path that we must trek. we welcome all the assistance and support from our development partners towards this cause. ldc 4 madame president, this year solomon islands met two of the three criterions for ldc graduation, for the second consecutive time. the committee on development policy recommended that solomon islands graduate from the list of ldcs. the economic and social council [ecosoc], has also recommendation that this august body consider and endorse our graduation accordingly. while my government appreciates the report and its recommendations, i must point out that as a post-conflict state, solomon islands will require the development of appropriate prudent macroeconomic and fin nce policies to maintain the threshold indicators upon which the recommendation for graduation is premised. it is therefore my fervent hope that this assembly will grant solomon islands an opportunity to properly assess the potential impacts of ldc graduation on key sectors which sustain our economy. a predictable and workable strategy that would put us on a continued upward trajectory, will need to be developed as well. i call on the united nations system to support us in these assessments and in the development of appropriate strategies that would assist us to boldly move forward with confidence. the solomon islands government respects the process of graduation that is based on an agreed rules-based system and will endeavor to graduate from he ldc status. however, any appropriate and relev nt assessment undertaken of the country must be well-conceived, thorough, and consultative. as you are aware, graduation from ldc status of sids such as solomon islands will not 5 improve our vulnerabilities. to that end we are pleased to know that a special taskforce has been established to ensure a smooth transition of sids from ldc. climate change madam president, whilst we in solomon islands are not subject to threats of an armed invasion, we are nevertheless continuously being invaded by a common enemy that we call climate change . climate change is the greatest threat facing humankind. for us in the pacific islands this threat is existential. the resulting climate change related extreme weather events means that solomon islands is more susceptible to natural disasters of greater severity. the threat of sea level rise, as well as inundation and salination of arable land, the destruction of biodiversity, including through a warming ocean and acidification, are ingredients for the causation of food security concerns and increase the risk of potential conflicts. in light of this threat, solomon islands calls for collective lobal leadership in climate change action and for strengthened commitment towards positive outcomes in cop24 in katowice, poland, this year. solomon islands joins other pacific islands states in strongly urging the largest emitters of green house gasses to take urgent actions in reducing this harmful emission. reduce now or regret later. 6 in the ongoing dialog on the climate challenge appropriate financial support to sids address their loss and dama e resulting from destructive effects of climate change, must be seriously considered. in our efforts to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and meet our intended nationally determined contributions [ndcs], solomon islands remains committed to transitioning to the use of renewable energy. on behalf of my government and people of solomon islands, i extend our gratitude to our partners, including the asian development bank, world bank, the green climate fund, the economic development cooperation fund of korea and australi n development assistance, for their financial assistance and support towards the tina hydro dam project. this project when completed will cater for some 80% of the capital, honiara s power consumption needs. i acknowledge the bilateral assistance provided by the governments of italy, spain, austria and luxemburg towards the pacific small island developing states, including solomon islands, to support renewable energy projects. we look forward to continuing the partnerships in the coming years. madam president, adequate and quality infrastructure is a prerequisite for positive economic and inclusive growth. investment in infrastructure projects positively impacts on a majority of the population and enhances accessibility to goods and services, both private and public. in this connection, solomon islands is grateful to the government and people of japan in the transformative development ofmajor infrastructures such as the 7 honiara city main roads, honiara sea port and the proposed upgrade of honiara international airport. the opening of the second international airport in munda, and the undersea fiber optic cable are also game ch nging infr structures, for which the people and government of solomon islands are grateful for this valuable assistance from australia and new zealand. cooperation solomon islands has benefited through south-south cooperation on capacity development programs with countries such as papua new guinea, fiji and cuba, including the potential to explore other innovative opportunities such as pharmaceutical solutions. the people of solomon islands are forever grateful to all our development partners for the genuine and durable partnerships. we will collaborate and increase efforts going forward. oceans madam president, as a large ocean state, the issue of conservation and proper management of ocean resources, is an important priority for solomon islands. we will ac ively engage on matters concerning the management of oceans. with regard to oceans management on the high seas, my government welcomes, the recent first intergovernmental conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument, under the united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos), concerning areas of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. 8 a successful outcome of fair and equitable framework will again prove the relevance of this organization and its convening powers. at the regional level, solomon islands subscribes to the blue pacific initiative which sets the context for the development of our regional priorities. we believe that maintaining the wellbeing of the oceans should be a key priority as acknowledged in sdg14. restoration of fish stocks, implementation of science-based management measures, monitoring, control and enforcement are but some of the measures which solomon islands is promoting through domestic and regional arrangements. at the national level, i am pleased to inform the assembly that we are in the final stages of developing an ocean policy that will rationalize, enhance coordination and support implementation of all ocean-related legislations and policies. the development of the national policy is a voluntary commitment that we announced at last year s ocean conference. madam president, security concerns have become more complex. it now involves activities beyond traditional definitions. some of these now include new threats such as climate change, cybercrimes, transnat onal organized crime and so forth. therefore, it is now more important than ever, that we work more closely and collectively with the international community to address these security concerns and threats. 9 this year we witnessed constructive engagement towards better managing relations along the korean peninsula. the un must continue to ensure that conflict prevention and resolution remains a central plank to its work as mandated by the un charter. solomon islands recognizes that the stability in the middle east is critical to world peace. a peaceful middle east will lead to a prosperous world. solomon islands also continues to call for peaceful settlement and supports the two state solution in the israel and palestinian conflict. in the pacific, security concerns are driven by external factors, human security and clim te change challenges. in recognizing the importance of our changing security landscape, pacific islands forum leaders undertook to build on the positive platform established by the biketawa declaration. this culminated in our adoption earlier this month of the boe declaration, at the recent pie summit in nauru. as we continue to work towards the goal of global peace, the need to actively engage in peacekeeping remains. madam president, although small, solomon islands is contributing towards achieving global peace and security, through participation in the un s peace keeping program. so far solomon islands has contributed 12 officers towards the united nations african mission in south sudan. 10 solomon islands is committed to increasing our participation in un peace keeping missions. cognizant of the important role of un peacekeeping missions, we call on the un's collective support towards ensuring that the sustainability of un programs is not being undermined by funding shortfalls. having benefited from the regional assistance mission to solomon islands, solomon islands values the importance of peacekeeping missions. madam president, to sustain peace, adequate resources are required. the international community also recognize this. in this connection, solomon islands has benefited from the peacebuilding funds approved under the peacebuilding commission in november 2017. through the resources provided under the peacebuilding fund e have been able to facilitate dialog involving a wide range of stakeholders on key issues including land reform, rural development, border issues, and youth and women s participation. recognizing the complex and ever-changing global security landscape and realities, solomon islands reiterates the call for the reforms of the security council to be inclusive by expanding its focus to non-traditional security priorities. sids must have a voice, through a dedicated seat in the nonpermanent-seat category in the council 11 ncd madam president the biggest threat facing the pacific islands apart from climate change, is the threat caused by non-communicable diseases. approximately 70% to 80% of all deaths in the pacific can be attributed to ncds, with many of these deaths being premature. in the pacific, including solomon islands, the high prevalence of ncds translates to an economic burden on health care systems. two thirds of beds at national referral hospital in honiara, our capital is occupied by ncd patients. the burden that ncds has on the productivity of the people of the solomon islands, and opportunities foregone to provide care for ncd patients, is an eminent socio-economic concern for an economy with a small human resource base. the nternational community already acknowledged the ncd challenge to sids in the samoa pathway. now is the time for action. taiwan madam president, whilst, we speak of leaving no one behind, we still close our doors to taiwan and continue to contradict our own principles by leaving taiwan s 23 million people behind. m dam president, the implementation of the sdgs requires a unified global partnership. taiwan is ready, willing and able to engage in and contribute to the wide range of substantive un programs for the welfare of humanity. 12 solomon islands continues to call for the participation of taiwan in the united nations specialized bodies including unfccc, world health organization and the international civil aviation authority organization. taiwan is the 22nd largest economy in the world and as such taiwan must be part of the global solutions in the various international frameworks. moreover, it has a lot to contribute through its experience and technology capability. if we are to focus on shared responsibility nd promote peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, we must give taiwan and its 23 million people a chance. despite the contributions of taiwan towards the well-being of citizens of the globe, we continue to ignore the right of taiwan to self-determination. madam president, the time has come for this august body to give due recognition to taiwan as a legitimate member of the family of nations. madam president, it is important th t administrating powers, the non-selfgoverning territories and all relevant organizations honor their commitments made under the charter of the 1960 declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples. to that end and in ccordance with the 1998 noumea accord, solomon islands/welcomes the referendum to be held in new caledonia on 4th november 2018 that is both free and fair. solomon islands re ffirms that human ri hts principles are universal, indivisible, interrelated and must be treated in a fair manner. all states have the moral duty and responsibility to uphold, respect and promote human rights 13 and; where necessary take preventive protective and punitive measures against human rights abuses and violations. solomon islands recognizes and respects indonesia s sovereignty over its territorial boundaries. my government commits to work with the government of indonesia on areas of mutual interest including human rights concerns in papua and west papua. madam president, solomon islands is committed to the principles of good governance and transparency. we have passed the anti-corruption act which aims to eliminate the scourge of corruption from all levels of our society. in addition, parliament has passed our whistle-blowers protection act giving due protection to those that that bring issues of corruption to the attention of the relevant authorities. solomon islands is also committed to the democratic principles and processes and we are equally committed to the holding of free and fair elections in early 2019. madam president, solomon islands is an ardent believer in collective action. we are staunch supporters of multilateralism. as such we stand in solidarity with all members of this body - the pinnacle of multilateralism. without the un, as a small island country, we will not be able to be heard. other louder voices will drown ours. our expectations from this organization will remain high. as such, adequate resources for programs and projects that will impact citizens is needed. the un has flaws. but solomon islands continues to 14 feel the impact of the power of working together on global issues that are championed by the un. we believe that the principles and values upon which the un is founded remain relevant. making united nations relevant to all people is not just about standing up and talking about it in this august body. it is incumbent upon us all to be seen as making united nations relevant to all peoples in the actions we take individuall and collectively. madam president, 1 thank you. 15","ricky nelson houenipwela, prime minister of solomon islands, said implementing the sustainable development goals requires a unified global partnership, one which recognizes that together the world can conquer the inequities of today. however, the very foundation and strengths of multilateralism are currently being challenged and undermined by unilateral posturing and insular policies that have seen some countries reverse their commitments to international agreements. yet, the united nations allows its membership to consolidate collective resolve to achieve progress in all fields. citing examples of national progress on reaching the goals, he said solomon islands completed a midterm review of the samoa pathway and has met two of three criteria for graduation from the group of least developed countries. yet, as a post‑conflict state, his country will require prudent macroeconomic and finance policies to maintain threshold indicators. expressing hope the general assembly will grant solomon islands an opportunity to assess the potential impact of graduating from the group, he said a predictable, workable strategy would put the country on a continued upward trajectory. calling on the united nations for support during these processes, he noted with pleasure that a special task force has been established to ensure a smooth transition. raising climate change concerns, he called for collective global leadership and strengthened commitment towards the forthcoming twenty‑fourth session of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, to be held in poland. for its part, solomon islands remains committed to transitioning to renewable energy use and is, through partnerships, completing infrastructure projects and cooperating with other nations on a range of development programs. goal‑related efforts also include ocean management, developing an ocean policy and subscribing to the blue pacific initiative, which sets the context for developing regional priorities. given the increasingly complex global security threats, he said, working together is more important than ever. highlighting progress on the korean peninsula, he said efforts must now focus on achieving stability in the middle east and peacefully settling the israeli‑palestinian conflict. noting the pacific islands forum’s outcome document on the region’s shifting security landscape, he expressed support for united nations peacekeeping operations. having benefited from the peacebuilding fund in 2017, solomon islands has facilitated dialog with stakeholders on key issues. recognizing the ever‑changing global security situation, he reiterated a call to reform the security council, adding that the small island developing states must have a voice through a dedicated non‑permanent seat. turning to other threats, he said action is urgently needed to address non‑communicable diseases, which cause almost 80 per cent of all deaths in the region and are placing a heavy burden on health‑care systems. on other issues, he called for the united nations to recognize taiwan as a member state and pledged his government’s commitment to work with indonesia on areas of mutual interest, including human rights concerns in papua and west papua. to address national challenges, the government passed anti‑corruption and whistle‑blower‑protection legislation and is committed to holding free and fair elections in 2019. “without the united nations, as a small island country, we will not be able to be heard,” he said, expressing ardent support for multilateralism. “the united nations has flaws, but solomon islands continues to feel the impact of the power of working together on global issues.”"
Somalia,"satement h.e ahmed isse awad minister of foreign affairs federal rebulic of somalia on the occacion of the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nation general assembly new york 29 september 2018 madam president, mr secretary general, excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen. it is a profound honor for me to address the united nations general assembly on behalf of the president of the federal republic of somalia. our administration has now completed one and a half years; whereas i am glad to say that we have significantly made huge strides in the security sector reform, and in political and economic transformation, we are mindful of the enormous challenges that we face in fixing somalia, and especially in overcoming the threats of terrorism. i am equally mindful of the huge expectations that our people have in our president's leadership, and in providing lasting solutions to the challenges of security. it is for that reason that our president, his excellency mohamed abdullahi mohamed had spent six weeks at the defense headquarters, and spent time at various defense positions; giving directions, and on-the-ground approvals, at the forward operating bases. we have initiated a new round of operations that have successfully opened up road networks, supply routes and in turn liberated towns and villages from the occupation of al-shabab terrorists. we recognize providing lasting solutions to the challenge of security is an immense undertaking; it is one that needs multi-faceted approach. while we-together with our partners- militarily take out and dismantle all terrorists hideouts, we are also engaging our religious leaders, elders, the youth, women and civil society groups to turn the tide against the twisted ideology of hate and religious intolerance. the silver lining is, young men and women are not joining alshabab out of a desirable appeal. that ideology is no longer popular; alshabab and alqaeda do not have a ready stream of new and volunteer recruits in somalia. not anymore. it is also important to note that some within their ranksmostly the young men and women- have headed our amnesty offer, denounced violence and peacefully surrendered. senior commanders, former sector heads and infantrymen have unconditionally surrendered as well, bringing with them arsenal and non-standard tactical vehicles known in military terms as ""technicals"" thecombination of these factors has further weakened the terror network's logistical and planning capabilities. alshabab how largely exists as an amorphous network that operates as an irregular outfit, one that plans terror attack from the shadows, but not as a stronger insurgent force that can sustain resistance. we are now engaged in the creation of civil networks to encourage a healthy partnership enforcement and communities to flush between out law remnant terrorists. our people acknowledge that sustaining security is a collective responsibility; this awareness has in turn helped us establish effective policing models that involve the public. our quest for a peaceful and stable somalia would not stop at defeating alshabab, but it is the first step. our comprehensive security sector reform is the basis for developing the capacity, streamlining, strategizing and implementing a practical transition that envisions aneffective force, and steady security institutions. we recognize that promoting justice, respecting the rule of law and protecting peoples' rights is a key component in peace building. this quest includes an organized, gradual, and systematic transfer of security tasks to forces agreed in our national security architecture, while at the same time establishing political and economic measures to support and sustain the transition at the federal, state and community level. on behalf of the people of somalia, i unequivocally say, we are truly grateful to the brave men and women who served and continue serving in the african union mission for somalia. they've made huge sacrifices to keep our people safe, and that shall never be forgotten. we remain indebted to them. to consolidate our collective gains in security, and to further support the somali security institutions, to enable us to take over from amisom, i call on the un to lift the arms embargo on somalia. this embargo has been long-standing; it is what is leveling the field in our battle with the terrorist groups. when our force has the same fighting arsenal as the enemy, the odds are split. stronger fighting capacity would enable us to have the upper hand, it would entirely dismantle the terrorists, and possibly within a shorter time. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. it is our administration's foremost objective that we expand the democratic space of our people, it should be sacrosanct that every somali enjoys the inalienable rights to life, freedoms and protections enshrined in our provisional constitution-including freedom of the press, freedom of association and even the freedom to petition the government for redress from grievances. and that is the reason why we are winning the fight against terrorists. our people have been suppressed and subjugated for a long time by the terrorist networks. these freedoms and protections mean a lot to them. individually and collectively our people and communities recognize that it is the responsibility of their government to protect their liberties, our people equally appreciate that for the government to do that, we must all operate within the realms of our constitution. one of our core values is the protection, support and giving platform to minority groups, communities, and those with special needs. our people acknowledge that for the system of governance to be effective, the rule of law must reign supreme. only then can we attain the vision of a prosperous somalia. our quest for inclusive and reformed politics is on the right track. we have an agreed upon election model, adopted jointly by the central government and the federal member states in baidoa in june of this year, and endorsed by the international community in brussels, during the somalia partnership forum in july. we acknowledge that it is election period for some of the federal member states, our role- as the central government- would be to promote transparent, free and fair processes. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen we have set specific goals in economic development; we do have frameworks for key deliverables in attaining goals towards sustainable productivity- in agriculture, fisheries and livestock. somalia enjoys the double blessings of a strategic location on the horn of africa, and a vast wealth in natural resources. significant oil reserves, natural gas, and iron ore, arable and productive fields, as well as africa's second longest coastline after the island of madagascar provide enormous opportunities for sustainable output. this government's objective isto tap into these opportunities, transform our economy, streamline our trade and investment policies and open up new trade routes, and horizons for our people in that regard, we are seeking to strengthen alliances with our core partners to promote trade and investment opportunities even as we widen our scope in our quest for broader, far-reaching economic cooperation. we seek to strengthen strategic partnerships with our neighbors, the continent and the world where we share mutual interests in economic development, security and promotion of social cooperation. one of the key priorities of this government is to promote sustainable fiscal policies to grow our economy and instill the discipline required to maintain it. somalia is committed to working purposefully towards financial self-sufficiency and, as a result, reaching the crucial sustainable development goals. through the imf staff monitored program we have raised domestic revenue to unprecedented levels and we are in the process of normalizing relations with the international financial institutions through continuous dialog and meaningful engagement. these efforts are edging us closer towards debt relief. 10 somalia is committed to boost economic integration and free trade flow across the region. the horn of africa is undergoing a remarkable political and economic transformation. somalia is proud to be taking a huge role in the quest for the economic integration of the horn, and in taking mediator role in ending decades-long conflicts that has dogged the region, contributing towards realizing the african union goal of silencing the gun by 2020 a new dawn of leadership is at hand in the horn of africa, and a stronger desire to bolster historical ties for common interests provides the means for effective cooperation among the countries of the horn. to achieve our common goal of economic progress and prosperity for the horn of africa, i humbly call on the united nations to lift all economic sanctions on our neighbor, eritrea. 11 this move would ease flow of imports and exports, movement of people and businesses, and it would fulfill our vision for the successful economic integration of the region. there is evidence everywhere that africa is on the move towards greater connectivity and prosperity. east africa is becoming the continent's fastest growing region, as africa becomes the world's largest free trade area. it is time for us to turn our focus on, and encourage intra-african investment. somalia- with it's potential in resources, is committed to move with the continent. we've recently joined the comesa trade bloc, and we've also applied admittance to a number of other trade and economic blocs. 12 excellencies, ladies and gentlemen it is only by expanding the prospects for open markets, free trade, investments and policies that ease movement of people and businesses between the countries of africa that we can bring solutions for domestic, economic and social challenges that we face, and work towards realizing agenda 2063 of the african union. we need to formulate joint policies that provide lasting solutions for illegal immigration. policies that expand our scopes and vision in economic and social progress that in result bring about job creation and opportunities for our youth, provide meaningful employment and improve quality of education. it should no longer be business as usual when year in, year out we are losing hundreds of young productive men and women to the mediterranean, ostensibly in search for better living prospects. 13 it is even ironic that this happens as the world focuses on africa for its resources, markets, and labor. excellencies, ladies and gentlemen i am hopeful that better days, and better prospects are ahead for all us. for somalia, it is the beginning of a transformation; we have risen anew and fresh. we are not only optimistic, but we are also motivated. our security is improving, our economy is on an upward scale, our foreign policy has already received accolades in the region and beyond. we are focused on keeping pace with the ever-changing dynamics in economy and technology and embracing new ideas, and as such we are open to all investments. we are ready for business. thank you!! 14","ahmed awad isse, minister of foreign affairs of somalia, said that since assuming office a year and a half ago, his administration has made huge strides in security sector reform and political and economic transformation, yet is mindful of the enormous challenges ahead, particularly to overcome terrorism. new road networks and supply routes have been opened, liberating towns and villages from al-shabab. stressing the importance of a multi-faceted security approach, he said the government and its partners have militarily dismantled terrorist hideouts, while also engaging religious leaders, elders, youth, women and civil society groups to dramatically reverse the twisted ideology of hate and religious intolerance. joining al-shabab is no longer appealing to young men and women; that group and al-qaeda no longer have a ready stream of new and volunteer recruits in somalia. some have accepted the offer of amnesty, denounced violence and surrendered peacefully. senior commanders, former sector heads and infantrymen also have surrendered unconditionally, weakening the terror network’s logistical and planning capabilities. the government is now working with civil networks to flush out remaining terrorist. awareness that sustaining security is a collective responsibility has helped establish effective policing models involving the public, he said, citing plans to gradually transfer security tasks to the national security architecture. he thanked the african union mission in somalia (amisom) and called on the united nations to lift the arms embargo on somalia in order to consolidate collective security gains and further support somali institutions. “stronger fighter capacity would enable us to have the upper hand, it would entirely dismantle terrorists, and possibly within a shorter time,” he said. every somali should enjoy the inalienable right to life, freedoms and protections enshrined in the provisional constitution, he said, noting that a core value is the protection and support of minority groups, communities and persons with special needs. a prosperous somalia is only possible when the governance system is effective and based on the rule of law. somalia’s quest for inclusive, reformed politics is on the right track, he said, citing the election model adopted by the central government and federal member states in baidoa in june 2018. turning to economic development and sustainable productivity, he said that tapping into opportunities created by somalia’s vast natural resources and long coastline will help transform the economy, streamline trade and open new trade routes, while stressing the need to strengthen alliances with partners worldwide. to achieve the sustainable development goals, somalia is working towards financial self-sufficiency. through the international monetary fund (imf) staff monitored program domestic revenue reached unprecedented levels. the government is now normalizing relations with international financial institutions bringing it closer to debt relief. somalia is taking a huge role in achieving economic integration in the horn of africa and serving as a mediator to end decades-long conflicts dogging the region to achieve the african union goal of silencing the guns by 2020. towards that end, all economic sanctions on eritrea should be lifted. on agenda 2063, he stressed the need for joint policies that provide lasting solutions for illegal immigration. “it should no longer be business as usual when year in year out hundreds of young productive men and women are lost to the mediterranean in search of better living prospects,” he stressed, called it ironical as the world focuses on africa for its resources, markets and labor. he expressed hope for better days and prospects for all. “for somalia, it is the beginning of a transformation; we have risen anew and fresh. we are not only optimistic, but we are also motivated,” he said."
South Africa,"permanent mission of south africa to the united nations 333 east 38^' street 9™floor new york, ny 10016 tel: (212)213-5583 fax: (212) 692-2498 email: pmun@southafrica-newyork.net statement by h.e. mr cyril ramaphosa president of the republic of south africa on the occasion of the general debate of the session of the united nations general assembly united nations new york 25 september 2018 madame president of the session of un general assembly, ms maria fernanda espinosa, secretary general, mr antonio guterres, excellencies heads of state and government, majesties, heads of delegation, colleagues, ladles and gentleman, i have the honor to address this august body, the united nations general assembly for the first time as president of the republic of south africa. it is nearly a quarter of a century since the founding father of our democracy, president nelson rollhlahia mandela stood at this podium to declare that: ""the millions across our globe who stand expectant at the gates of hope look to this organization [the united nations], to bring them peace, to bring them life, to bring them a life worth living."" as we mark the centenary of the birth of this great global leader, we are bound to ask whether the united nations has met the needs and the expectations of the millions who stand at the gates of hope. we are bound to ask what contribution the united nations has made to a more peaceful, more prosperous and more equal world. more importantly, we are called upon to ask - as we did yesterday during the nelson mandela peace summit - what the united nations and the assembled global leadership must do to secure lasting peace, reconciliation and stability across the globe. allow me to express the deep gratitude of the government and the people of south africa to the international community for convening the peace summit to honor the memory of nelson mandela and advance his legacy. we applaud the political declaration of the summit, which recognizes the period from 2019 to 2028 as the nelson mandela decade of peace. this reflects a new and sincere commitment by the world's leaders to comprehensively advance peace and security and resolve all conflicts and wars. to succeed in giving effect to this commitment, the un must become what billions of people across the world want it to be - a representative and truly democratic global parliament of the people. throughout its seven decades, the un has been a source of hope for the oppressed, exploited and poor. during the dark days of colonialism and apartheid, we drew strength, inspiration and encouragement from the un and its charter in our quest for self-determination. to the poor, vulnerable, and marginalized, the un today is a beacon of promise in a landscape of doubt. to billions across the world, the un is the most powerful instrument we possess to achieve a more equal, more humane and more inclusive world. they are men and women with dreams and aspirations that transcend the hardships of the present, who want to contribute to a new global civilization defined by compassion, justice and solidarity. they want an end to the greed, ignorance and conceit that is driving the destruction of our only home, the earth. it is within our hands, as the leaders assembled here today, to forge a more representative, equal and fair united nations that is empowered and equipped to lead the struggle to end poverty, unemployment and inequality in the world. we are a youthful world, where more than half the global population is under the age of 30 years. one of the greatest challenges to the achievement of global prosperity and development is the continued exclusion of millions of women and young people from meaningful economic participation. it is therefore vital that we deploy every means at our disposal to address youth unemployment and ensure universal access to educational opportunities that are appropriate to the changing world of work. we need a deliberate program to ensure that the digital revolution - which carries such great potential for both disruption and empowerment - is effectively harnessed to promote social justice and human progress. the call to leave no one behind requires that we strengthen the institutions of global governance and make them more responsive to the needs of young people, particularly in the developing world. this is even more pronounced on our continent, africa, where two-thirds of its people were not yet born when nelson mandela was released from prison. this places a responsibility on us, as leaders, not only to put the interests of young people at the center of our efforts, but also to empower women and young people to be more prominent in directing the course of global affairs. it is young people who are fighting the wars that we started. it is women who are bearing the brunt and hardships of the wars that continue to destroy their families and lives. as we speak, young lives are being lost and futures are being destroyed. there is an urgency to the measures we must take to end conflict and war. not only must we stop the death, destruction and human suffering that is visited daily on millions of people, but we must act with purpose to prevent the loss of another entire generation to its aftermath. we must accept our shared responsibility - and our shared interest - in ending conflict, and, using the outcomes of the nelson mandela peace summit, to empower the united nations to be a more effective instrument for mediation, peace keeping and post-conflict reconstruction. in this spirit it is crucial that we should preserve the joint comprehensive plan of action with iran, which was one of the most important breakthroughs in international diplomacy in recent times. our resolve to end ongoing conflicts and our determination to root out terrorism must be matched by action and by the appropriate deployment of resources. we must act with the same urgency to resolve some of the world's most protracted and intractable disputes. the fact that the people of palestine have endured occupation and suffering for nearly as long as the united nations has existed, makes their plight no less pressing, nor their suffering any less acceptable. we must similarly intensify our efforts to secure the right of the people of western sahara to self-determination and full national sovereignty. institutions like the united nations, world bank, imf and the wto need to be reshaped and enhanced so that they may more effectively meet the challenges of the contemporary world and better serve the interests of the poor and marginalized. reform of the united nations, and particularly its security council, is a priority if we are to give full effect to the values and principles enshrined in the un charter. in this regard. south africa would like to express its profound gratitude for the strong mandate it received to be a non-permanent member of the united nations security council for the period 2019 to 2020. we must resist any and all efforts to undermine the multilateral approach to international trade, which is essential to the promotion of stability and predictability in the global economy. the history of the global economy informs us that no country can prosper at the expense of all others, and that no people can hope to live in comfort and security for as long as millions of others languish in poverty. it is therefore essential that we take collective responsibility for the development of all nations and for the improvement of the lives of all people. this responsibility is manifest in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, the paris agreement on climate change and the addis ababa action agenda on the financing of development, among others. together, they represent our common commitment to tackle poverty, underdevelopment and environmental degradation. they represent our common commitment to tackle diseases like aids, tuberculosis, malaria, diabetes and cancer. our task as global leaders is to pursue the policies that are required to turn intent into implementation and mobilize the resources needed to turn implementation into impact. your excellencies, as africans, we have made significant strides in addressing the challenges that have confronted our continent over many decades. we continue to vigorously implement our commitments contained in the african union agenda 2063, which is our collective plan to rid our continent of underdevelopment, poverty and conflict and improve democratic governance, the rule of law and the promotion of human rights. we have reached agreement on the establishment of an african continental free trade area, which will fundamentally transform african economies, giving rise to a new industrial age on the continent. we are working to silence the guns in africa by 2020, to bring an end to conflicts that have cost the lives of millions of our people, displaced many more and stunted economic growth and human development. as the continent with the youngest population in the world, africa has the potential to be the next great frontier for global growth. with effective investment in education, improved health care, good governance and greater economic integration, africa has the potential to develop its productive capacity on a scale and at a rate that will lift tens of millions out of poverty. the youth of africa are poised to transform their continent. allow me to conclude by once more drawing on the wisdom of nelson mandela, when he said: ""sometimes it falls on a generation to be great."" this is not the generation that will stand expectant at the gates of hope. this is the generation that will change the world. this is their time, and this is their age. let their greatness blossom. i thank you.","matamela cyril ramaphosa, president of south africa, said nearly a quarter of a century has elapsed since nelson mandela stood at the assembly’s podium, declaring that millions of his people looked to the united nations “to bring them a life worth living”. asking if those hopes have been met, he said the organization is still called upon to ask what it must do to achieve peace, reconciliation and stability around the globe. welcoming the 24 september adoption of a political declaration marking 2019–2028 as the nelson mandela decade of peace, he said the organization is obliged to truly become what the people of the world want it to be: a voice for all, including the poor and marginalized, around the globe. “during the dark days of colonialism and apartheid, we drew strength, inspiration and encouragement from the united nations,” he said. today, he said, south africa is making strides in dealing with apartheid’s ugly legacy, including undertaking reforms to ensure that land “belongs to all who work it” and attracting millions of dollars in foreign investment. as world leaders assemble today, they must commit to forging a more fair, equal united nations that is better equipped to end the struggles against poverty and discrimination. those challenges are most pronounced in africa, which is “living in the age of youth” and bears a special responsibility to place young people and women at the center of its affairs. “it is young people who are fighting the wars that we started” and women who bear the brunt of conflicts, he stressed, underlining the urgency of measures needed to end wars, death, destruction and human suffering. emphasizing that commitments to address terrorism and end protracted disputes must be coupled with resources and action, he spotlighted the long‑standing plights of the palestinian people and western sahara, both of whom possess inalienable human rights. he also called for efforts to address youth unemployment and educational opportunities that are appropriate to the changing world of work. the potential of the digital revolution must be effectively harnessed to promote social justice as well as human progress, he stressed, also calling for stronger and more global institutions. indeed, he said, the united nations, the world bank, the world trade organization (wto) and others need to be revamped to better meet the needs of all peoples around the world. “we must resist any and all efforts to undermine the multilateral approach to trade” which is central to the global economy’s stability and predictability, he stressed, adding that history has demonstrated that no country can prosper alone. spotlighting the potential of the 2030 agenda to tackle those challenges and “turn implementation into impact”, he said african nations are working more closely together to rid the continent of underdevelopment and conflict while promoting the rule of law and human rights. for example, he said, the recently agreed african continental free trade area will give rise to a new industrial age in the region. “africa has the potential to be the next great frontier for global growth and development” with major investments in education, good governance, health care and large-scale industrial capacity aimed at lifting millions of people out of poverty. “the youth of africa are poised to transform their continent,” he said, reiterating south africa’s determination to always be a force for good, peace, development and progress around the globe."
South Sudan,"statement by h.e. gen. taban deng gai the first vice president republic of south sudan at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly 28th september 2018 new york, usa check against delivery your excellency maria fernanda espinosa graces, president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly, your excellency antonio guterres, secretary general of the united nations, your excellencies heads of state and government, honorable ministers, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, good morning madam president, it is my utmost honor to deliver this statement on behalf of h.e. gen. salva kiir mayardit, president of the republic of south sudan who unfortunately could not be present here today due to his engagement in consolidating and streamlining the implementation of the peace process. madam president, i would also like to congratulate you, madam president, on your election as president of this 73rd session of the general assembly and being the 4th woman to hold this position. the republic of south sudan affirms it commitment to play its role in supporting the implementation of the agenda you set for this historic session. on behalf of the people of the republic of south sudan, and my government i would like to reiterate our heartfelt condolences to the family of the former un secretary general h.e. koffi annan who passed away recently and to the entire un family. he played a crucial role in supporting the people of the republic of south sudan by ensuring that there was peace and was instrumental in formation of the republic of south sudan. 2 also, i was happy to witness the centenary of late madiba. it was indeed befitting that the un dedicated 24th september for the nelson mandela summit. he was an icon of peace, whose legacy will live forever. madam president, the theme that you have selected for this session “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, resonates very well with the vision of the republic of south sudan for peace and prosperity. madam president, your excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, allow me at this juncture to share with this august house some of the successes we have made in our long walk to peace and prosperity: last year, i stood before you as the first vice president of a country amidst violent conflict. today, i stand before you as a testament of what members of this body have helped achieve in the republic of south sudan, especially the dedicated un agencies operating in our country, the igad, au, eu, troika, china, igad partners forum (ipf), international partners and friends of south sudan. i am pleased to inform this august house, of a more united republic of south sudan, that is heading towards peaceful stability. with the continued support and goodwill from our regional and international partners, we are on schedule to hold free and fair general elections after a transitional period of 36 months. 3 the path towards this agreement begun at the 31st extra-­ordinary summit of igad assembly of heads of states and government on the republic of south sudan of 12th june 2017 in addis ababa, ethiopia. they aligned on the need for a high-­level revitalization forum (hlrf) of all the parties to the agreement on the resolution of conflict in the republic of south sudan (arcss). this process included new stakeholders and the inclusion of various groups including civil society, women groups, religious leaders, youth and eminent personalities as observers. the purpose of the hlrf, as stated by the extra-­ordinary igad heads of state summit held in addis ababa, ethiopia, was threefold. firstly, to institute a permanent ceasefire, second to give fresh impetus to the inclusive implementation of the provisions of the arcss and thirdly, to agree on new realistic timelines and implementation schedules towards democratic elections at the end of the transitional period. the government of the republic of south sudan unreservedly embraced the igad-­ led high level revitalization forum (hlrf) for the agreement on the resolution of the conflict in the republic of south sudan (arcss). its objectives were crystal clear and to that extent, the delegation of the government of the republic of south sudan attended the hlrf meetings fully prepared to utilize the opportunities to bring about the achievement of comprehensive and lasting peace. the 32nd extra-­ordinary summit of igad on the republic of south sudan entrusted h.e. field marshal omar hassan ahmed el-­bashir, president of the republic of sudan to facilitate a second (2nd) round of face-­to-­face discussions between h.e. gen. salva kiir mayardit and dr. riek machar teny and other political leaders to resolve the outstanding issues on governance and security arrangements of the igad-­ led high-­level revitalization forum (hlrf). madam president, 4 the signing of the khartoum declaration of agreement between the parties to the conflict in the republic of south sudan took place on the 27th june 2018. h.e. gen. salva kiir mayardit and dr. riek machar together with other political leaders approved under that agreement: i) declaration of permanent ceasefire throughout south sudan based on the cessation of hostilities agreement (coha) signed on 21st december 2017. ii) adoption of security arrangements in order to build one national army, police and other security organs of an inclusive character and iii) conclusion of the agreement on the revised bridging proposal before the closure of khartoum round of talks. on 12th september 2018, all the parties (transitional government of national unity (tgonu), sudan’s people liberation movement/army-­ in opposition (splm/a-­io), south sudan opposition alliance (ssoa), former detainees (fd’s), other political parties (opp) and other stakeholders to the arcss signed the final revitalized agreement on the resolution of the conflict in the republic of south sudan (r-­ arcss, 2018) in addis ababa, ethiopia. this was graciously attended and witnessed by the igad heads of state and government, the international community (au, eu, un, troika, china, ipf, international partners and friends of the republic of south sudan). in addition to the recently signed revitalized peace agreement on the resolution of conflict in the republic of south sudan on 12th september 2018 (r-­arcss) in addis ababa, ethiopia. we have also embarked on the national dialog and the ‘grassroots people to people’s peace initiatives since december 2015. it is our belief that this complementary three-­track approach is the only way to consolidate the efforts for peace on the ground. moreover, this ensures the return to accountability and the upholding of human rights in my country. in a unique environment such as the republic of south sudan, a multilayered approach like the one adopted by my government is the best way forward. madam president, your excellencies, distinguished delegates, 5 ladies and gentlemen, it is, therefore, against this background that the transitional government of national unity (tgonu) has embraced the full implementation of the agreement on the resolution of conflict in the republic of south sudan (arcss, 2015) as the only instrument pivotal to achieving this mission and vision. the government of the republic of south sudan is ready to welcome forces from the guarantors of the revitalized agreement on the resolution of conflict in the republic of south sudan (r-­arcss) to monitor the implementation of the peace agreement and encourages the igad & au to dialog with the united nations security council (unsc) on how the regional protection force (rpf) can help in monitoring and ensuring that peace holds in the republic of south sudan. with regards to security sector reforms, which are a major pillar of the revitalized agreement on resolution of the conflict in the republic of south sudan (r-­ arcss, 2018), my government reiterates its commitment and resolve to implement transitional security arrangements. indeed, they encompass a range of security sector reforms, including the cantonment of forces. moreover, the government is committed to transforming the sudan peoples’ liberation army (spla), and structures are already in place to achieve the aim of creating a professional national army. i am very pleased to inform this august house of the formation of the national pre-­ transitional committee (nptc), which is comprised of all the stakeholders, that shall be entrusted with the functions of oversight and coordination of the implementation of the peace agreement activities of the pre-­transitional period. madam president, your excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 6 connoted with the aim of achieving lasting peace is the establishment of mechanisms to tackle impunity and accountability. in the recently decided terrain case, the government interviewed the victims in order to hold the individuals responsible to account. a detailed investigation formula and evidence gathering process with the support of the us government through the fbi meant that the victims were able to identify their attackers and enable the law to prosecute those accountable to the full extent. since the eruption of the conflict in december 2013, the military court martial has tried 204 cases, including the terrain case. the terrain trials demonstrated the commitment of the spla to make its members account for their crimes, including abuse of civilians. it goes without saying that war has blighted the economy of the republic south sudan. we have seen tremendous loss in life, property and human dignity. no report can cut to my heart as the sight of our young and the infirm dying needlessly and suffering deprivation. indeed, i have been asked specifically why my government believes that it is a permanent peace this time? there is an african proverb that advises “to look where you have slipped, because it is there you will find what made you fall”. it is through a change of leaders’ attitude from entrenched positions that we have moved towards a reconciliatory and accommodating government of national unity. my president, h.e. gen. salva kiir mayardit has compromised on many positions and worked with more stakeholders for the sake of peace. the igad led peace initiatives have demonstrated the way in which african solutions to african problems, can lead to an agreement. madam president, your excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 7 i extend my heartfelt appreciation to igad, in particular the republic of sudan and the broader international community, without their critical role, this revitalized peace agreement would not have happened. in this regard, given the positive role being played by the republic of sudan in the peace process in the republic of south sudan and the region, we appeal for the speedy normalization of the relationship between the republic of sudan and united states of america. moreover, we call for the total lifting of sanctions against the republic of sudan. we urge the government of the republic of sudan for a speedy resolution of the contentious issues in blue nile, southern kordofan and darfur. this emanates from our strong belief that stability in these areas is critical for total and lasting peace in the republic of south sudan and the republic of sudan and the region as a whole. on abyei, as we await the settlement of its final status, the government of the republic of south sudan reiterates its support to the recommendations of the un secretary general to the un security council on august, 20th this year. we also commend the good work of unisfa and remain grateful to the federal democratic republic of ethiopia, the sole unisfa troops contributor. we also, urge this august house to support efforts still at the level of the african union to find a political solution to the abyei matter, in particular we call for the implementation of the au high implementation panel’s (hip)/ mbeki proposal of 21st september 2012, which has been accepted for more than six times to date by the au peace and security council. it is high time that we bring an end to the suffering of the ngok dinka people. madam president, your excellencies, 8 distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, conflict by itself can be a vehicle for positive change, if we are aware of where we came from, where we are now and where we are heading to. as brothers and sisters, we have hurt each other. as we seek national healing, my president h.e. gen. salva kiir mayardit, empowered a cross-­section of community representatives and mediators to set up a national dialog and other grassroots ‘people to people’ peace initiatives. the national dialog was launched to conduct a multilayered approach to repairing the social fabric. it has been heavily criticized by some external observers, mainly because of the misconception that it was considered as a substitute to the peace talks. at the launch of the national dialog in 2015, its aim was to create a forum in which the causes of conflict could be discussed, and among others things to ask the populace important questions such as those of national identity, governance and the relationship between the communities, including causes of inter communal conflict. the grassroots component has been the most effective, members of the committee visited regions starting from the community level asking questions designed to identify the causes of division whilst also searching for solutions to those divisions and how to heal them. the process allowed for those who didn’t have an opportunity to have their voices heard, to begin putting across their various viewpoints. the reports from the grassroots were candid in their nature, as the communities were allowed to express their opinions freely without fear of repercussions. we look forward to seeing the next steps of this process as we enter the transitional period. madam president, your excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 9 in “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, i would like to reiterate that my government welcomes the presence and support of the united nations agencies. however, the terms of this relationship need to be reconsidered, specifically in protecting the vulnerable citizens in the host country. it is only through a reflective approach that we can move forward towards adapting the nature of this institution to make it fit for the environment today. last but not least, as i speak of reviving peace in the republic of south sudan, it is only right to mention john f. kennedy who said “peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures”. i call upon members of the un family, including those who are skeptical, to give peace a chance in the republic of south sudan by supporting the critical implementation phase of the peace agreement. the republic of south sudan will continue its cooperation with the united nations, the regional bodies, igad, eac, au, eu, troika, china, other international partners and all our friends as we work to enhance conditions in our country. we undertake to consolidate peace, justice, rebuild strong institutions in our country, and stabilize our economy. we call upon you all as partners to support, cooperate, consult and dialog as we together partner in achieving your agenda for “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. this is our agenda too. thank you for your attention. 10 11","taban deng gai, first vice‑president of south sudan, highlighted how his country is heading towards peaceful stability. with the continued support and goodwill of regional and international partners, it was on schedule to hold free and fair general elections after a transitional period of 36 months. the path forward began

Spain,,"pedro sánchez pérez-castejón, president of spain, began by highlighting that for the first time in history a latin american woman is presiding over the general assembly. “i am a feminist politician,” he added. it is time to cultivate new cooperative leadership, based not only on a willingness to listen to others, but also a readiness to understand their motivations. it is time to accept that no single person has a monopoly on the truth, he said. spain is fully committed to the 2030 agenda, he added, stressing that the dignity of every single human being must be at the heart of all political action. without dignity and equality between women and men, without human rights, there can be no peace or development, he continued. “there is no greater injustice than that which defines what a human being will or will not be, based on whether they are born a boy or a girl,” he stressed. calling for the development of a global road map to eradicate all forms of discrimination suffered by women, he said that gender‑based violence, trafficking of women and girls, and female genital mutilation must be stopped. his cabinet of ministers is 60 per cent women, he said, commending the secretary‑general on having reached full parity in his senior management group for the first time in the history of the organization. it is crucial that women participate as peace brokers in all phases of conflicts. he also stressed the need to address the global migrant crisis, pledging commitment to the global compact on refugees. while spain has suffered the calamity of the economic crisis more than any other western european country, it has never turned its back on migrants. he went on to underscore that more than 15 million girls will never have the chance to learn to read and write, and that 330 million women are living on less than $2 a day. pledging spain’s full commitment to the 2030 agenda, he said his country adopted its own action plan to implement sustainable development. it focuses on combating gender violence, child poverty and energy poverty. in addition, spain is also committed to tackling climate change. “our future depends on renewable energy and clean technologies,” he added, expressing strong support also for the paris agreement. terrorism is still one of the major threats to freedom, he said, stressing the need to combat hatred and violence. “we must do all that we can to prevent young people from falling prey to fanaticism,” he emphasized. it is essential to invest in education and young people. the spread of armed conflict demands the international community’s attention. more than 160,000 spanish troops have served, with loyalty and commitment, to united nations peacekeeping operations. he expressed support for the france/mexico initiative to limit the use of veto power in cases of mass atrocities and for reform of the united nations proposed by the secretary‑general."
Sri Lanka,"address by h.e. maithripala sirisena, president of sri lanka at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly 25 september 2018, new york may the noble triple gem bless all of you! mr. president, mr. secretary-general, distinguished heads of state, distinguished delegates, friends, i am extremely pleased to participate in the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly representing sri lanka for the fourth consecutive occasion. sri lanka, as a member state of the united nations, is fully committed to adhere to its charter, conventions and agreements and their implementation. as head of state, i am pleased to note the progress that has been made by sri lanka and my government during the past three-and-a-half years. when i was elected by the people of sri lanka as head of state in january 2015, the executive office that i hold today, had excessive powers, which were comparable to those of a king, or even an emperor. i am pleased to state that i was able to relinquish these emperor-like excessive powers and transfer them to the parliament of sri lanka, fulfilling the utmost duty of an elected leader. during the past three-and-a-half years, democracy has been strengthened in my country. in addition, human rights, freedom of the people and the media as well as the independence of the judiciary have been strengthened. therefore, the sri lanka of today is not what it used to be threeand-a-half years ago. i can clearly state that the sri lanka of today is a society which is more inclusive and humane. we, as member states of the united nations, must consider it as our duty and responsibility to comprehensively study and reflect upon the contemporary political developments, economic disparities, and common challenges faced by humanity. when speaking of international political developments and trends, we must in particular focus our attention on refugees that have become a global issue as there are a large number of refugees all over the world. therefore, i believe that the efforts of the united nations, its member states and other organizations dealing with the issues related to refugees must be broader and more effective. sri lanka is a country that follows moderate policies with regard to the exercise of its foreign policy. we are a senior member of the non-aligned movement. the 1976 non-aligned summit, which is considered one of the most successful, was held in sri lanka. within the framework of non-alignment, we consider all nations of the world as friends. i am glad to note that sri lanka does not have adversaries in the contemporary world. when discussing international political issues, we must especially mention the issue of the palestinian people. i believe that the united nations and the world powers should approach this issue with greater understanding and attention. successive governments in sri lanka have supported the liberation struggle of the palestinian people. i believe that the united nations and all member states should adopt a more humane approach when advocating for the rights of the palestinian people, and taking into account the inhumane conditions they face, approach this issue in a broader manner. we all know that poverty is one of the fundamental problems affecting the world. i am of the view that the united nations can do more to address the issue of poverty. we know that today, hundreds of millions of people across the world suffer from hunger. climate change, income disparities, and certain shortcomings of governments to fulfill obligations towards their citizens, are among the key causes of poverty. the negative effects of climate change on economies have further exacerbated this problem. therefore, it is essential to assist and support countries which are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. i must mention that just as poverty plays a central role in many problems that plague the world, trafficking in weapons, illicit drugs and narcotics have also become grave threats to humanity. in this context, i am pleased about the agreement reached under the auspices of the united nations and the leadership of the us president donald trump on a ‘global call to action on the world drug problem’, yesterday. it is necessary that all countries do more towards combating illicit drugs with the assistance of the united nations, as a matter of priority. within the framework of action of the united nations, we must all work at national and international levels towards the implementation of the agreed outcomes of the paris agreement on climate change, finalized under the guidance of the former un secretary-general ban ki-moon, for the benefit of humanity as well as other living beings, our streams and rivers, and planet earth as a whole. i must state that sri lanka, as a un member state, gives utmost priority to these endeavors. speaking of internal matters of my beloved motherland, as i stated earlier, we have broadly strengthened democracy, human rights, fundamental rights and media freedom in the country. we must reflect on the situation of our country that prevailed forty years ago, and on the conflict that lasted for nearly thirty-years. it has been almost ten years since terrorism and armed conflict ended. during these ten years we have undertaken a broad range of reforms. my government in particular, has implemented several important steps in the post-conflict context. we have implemented, and continue to implement many programs aimed at fostering national harmony and reconciliation, and ensuring non-recurrence of conflict. as a country that has fulfilled and continues to fulfill our human rights obligations, we respectfully request the united nations and all other countries to continue to assist us in our endeavors. sri lanka's security forces defeated one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world. as a result, sri lanka remains an undivided country that enjoys sustainable peace. therefore, i must respectfully recall the yeoman service rendered by our security forces in defeating a dreaded terrorist organization, and i take this opportunity to thank our security forces for their great sacrifices in ushering peace and ensuring territorial integrity of sri lanka. at a time when almost ten years have passed since the end of the conflict, i call upon the international community to look at my country from a new perspective with new ideas. i call on you all to refresh your views on my noble motherland and assist us in our efforts towards achieving economic development, prosperity, and a secure future as a country at peace following a deadly conflict; as a country that is strengthening national reconciliation; as a country where national harmony prevails; as a country that has taken and continues to take every possible step to prevent recurrence of another conflict; and as a country that protects and upholds human rights. i respectfully request you to allow us the opportunity to resolve our own issues. the independence of a country is of paramount importance. i seek your support in our efforts, including in strengthening democracy and enhancing human development, while respecting our sovereignty. the sacrifices we have made and the initiatives we have taken in this regard are important for us in resolving our issues. as an independent country, we do not require foreign interference or threats. as a strong nation, we request all of you to allow us space to resolve our problems and to progress as an independent country. in this context, once again i wish to reiterate our request for your assistance and support for us to resolve our own issues as sri lankans. i further request your support in the efforts of my government to alleviate fear and suspicion among the communities living in our beloved motherland, and to build greater harmony. as i stated before, it is imperative to accord priority to address the issues of people in sri lanka and the world over who are poverty-stricken. we must find solutions to their problems, taking into consideration the ideas and thoughts of the younger generation. considering all of the above, i wish to finally reflect on what lord buddha stated in the salla sutta of the samyuktha nikaya in thethripitaka where it is said that a man pierced by a dart suffers twice: firstly, the physical pain caused by the dart, and secondly the mental agony caused in recollecting the act. similarly, the people of sri lanka have suffered both the physical pain of the prolonged conflict as well as the mental agony caused by the recollection of those unfortunate experiences. therefore, it is no one else but the people of sri lanka who need to be relieved of this pain. in conclusion, i respectfully request all to extend support to my people and country to progress towards a just, fair, equitable and humane society with economic prosperity, alleviating the pain that my people have endured. thank you. may the noble triple gem bless you.","maithripala sirisena, president of sri lanka, noted that his country as a member state of the united nations has always acted in accordance with treaties and conventions of the organization. he pointed out the satisfying progress sri lanka made in the last three and a half years. noting the emperor‑like power the executive presidency possessed, he said he handed it over to the parliament, and by so doing, democracy, the independence of the judiciary and freedom of the media have all been strengthened. sri lanka today is entirely different from the past, he stressed. recalling responsibilities and duties, he pointed to the prevalent issue of refugees as being very complex. even though the united nations and other organizations support refugees, he said, efforts must be more expansive. sri lanka, following a non-aligned foreign policy, has no enemies in the world. he voiced concern about the situation of the palestinian people, which required greater attention, adding that he supports their struggle for freedom. he called on the united nations to be more involved in fighting poverty, adding that hundreds of millions of people spend their day in hunger. he pointed out that the world faces many challenges in alleviating poverty and battling the consequences of climate change, saying that many efforts are needed by the heavily affected countries to be prosperous. he listed drug problems and the issue of pharmaceuticals as additional problems in their society. he mentioned the 24 september meeting of the united nations with the president of the united states on the global call to action on the world drug problem. efforts are required by every country in fighting illicit drugs. he highlighted the utmost importance of the paris agreement, adding that his country ratified it and will take necessary actions. concerning the conflict of the last 30 years, he pointed to the actions they took to consolidate democracy, protect human rights, strengthen national reconciliation and achieve economic prosperity, mentioning the massive transformations of the last 10 years. he stressed that the independence of a nation is of utmost importance. to continue the process of reconciliation, he said, we do not want any foreign power to influence us, adding, as sri lankans, we will find solutions to our problems, we simply need room to resolve them and the support of the united nations. he also said that the new generation deserved to be heard. the international community should look upon sri lanka from a fresh perspective as it is different today."
Sudan,,"eldirdiri mohamed ahmed, minster for foreign affairs of sudan, welcomed the leadership role of the united nations to promote sustainable development, serve humanity and confront challenges. he commended the partnership between the united nations and african union in darfur as well as the donor countries that promote stability and finance development projects. he also underscored his government’s successes and the tangible results of a national campaign aimed at collecting small arms and light weapons. this has led to a reduction in crime and has curbed drug and human trafficking. he further commended the role of the african union-united nations hybrid operation in darfur (unamid). negotiations are the only path to peace, he continued, calling for the opening of humanitarian corridors so that aid can reach people in need. sudan’s government has made ample effort to implement economic and fiscal reforms to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. however, despite efforts to mobilize local resources, unilateral sanctions imposed on sudan have undermined its development and ability to engage in development activities. sudan has the potential to achieve food security in the region, he said, adding: “you have to support our initiatives in that respect.” sudan did not support terrorism and must be lifted from the list of countries that does, he stressed. his country was and remains a sincere defender of justice and international cooperation. unfortunately, the selective approach adopted by the international criminal court has caused it to lose its impartiality. he aligned his country’s position to that of the african union, adding that the court is nothing but a political tool. turning to the migrant and refugee issue, he noted that his government has hosted more than three million refugees despite the harsh realities it faces. he urged the international community to provide his country with financial support in this regard. “we should not link any religion to terrorism,” he went on to say, adding that his government rejects all forms of terrorism to achieve political objectives, including islamophobia, abuse of religion and the spread of hatred. he also called on the international community to support regional initiatives to deal with various issues on the continent from conflict resolution to resource management. small and light weapons have a direct relationship to transnational organized crime and must be dealt with. welcoming the recently signed peace agreement with south sudan, he further commended the efforts of the intergovernmental authority on development (igad). acknowledging that the separation of south sudan from sudan was not easy, he said that sudan has made many sacrifices for south sudan. more so, those who doubt must give peace a chance."
Suriname,"ypb statement by the minister of foreign affairs of the republic of suriname, h.e. yldiz pollack - bei hle, at the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly, new york, 29 september 2018 excellency maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the general assembly colleagues, excellencies introduction it is an honor to deliver this statement on behalf of my president, his e cellency desire delano bouterse. madame president, i sincerely applaud your election as the first woman of the latin american and caribbean region, to preside over the 73rd session of the general assembly. in the course of this session year, the membership stands to gain greatly from your outstanding personal qualities and wealth of experience as a professional diplomat, at the helm of our general assembly. suriname pledges its unwavering support for your efforts in making our organization relevant again for the entire world community, in particular the disadvantaged and marginalized, including women and youth. madame president, as we remember the legacy of former secretary-general kofi annan, we honor his tireless efforts towards making the world more peaceful and humane by fighting against inequality and injustice, combating diseases and conflict with all the means at our disposal, and putting the united nations at the center of multilateralism. 1 ypb as honored as i am to address this gathering, that brings together so many world leaders, i am also disheartened by the somber tone expressed by secretary ge eral guterres, at the presentation of his annual report on the work of our organization. as the secretary general noted, targets set last year have not been met. and we have to ask ourselves will we make the same appeals this year, with tire same attitude of business as usual with regard to outcomes, whether effective or not? suriname concurs with the assessment of the secretary general that the fundamental issue confronting the international communit today is the lack of trust among nations. in this regard, as a small nation, my country firmly commits to upholding internationally accepted principles, which clearly define who we are, and which provide for predictable actions in our inte national relations, thereby creating a climate of trust, understanding and respect. we underscore the need for a rules-based world order with the united nations at the center, which is needed to create the necessary platform to address global concerns, among which the mobilization of funds to mitigate the effects of climate change. being a low lying coastal state, suriname is among the most threatened countries directly impacted by sea level rise. it is approximately 80% of our population that resides in the coastal area, while our main productive activities are also concentrated in this area, resulting in an existential threat. as we have witnessed in the past days, the forces of nature stroke once again, not only at our sister caribbean nations, but also elsewhere in the world, we are being urged to move beyond the rhetoric and take immediate action. mutual understanding, tolerance and solidarity madame president, my country is strate ically located on the guyana shield, has an abundance of natural resources, a unique biodiversity and an impressive forest cover of over 90%. 2 ypb moreover, our pop lation, including indigenous peoples, tribal communities of african descent, and various other ethnic groups, descends from all continents of the world. all expressing and enjoying exceptional tolerance and religious freedom, respect each other s cultural background, and all of whom are equally entitled and have access to social progr ms including healthcare and education. we ha e used this diversity inherited from our colonial past, to our advantage by rejecting the divide and rule of yesteryear. we are indeed proud that our people, coming from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, can live in peace and harmony with each other, forging bonds conducive to nation building and working towards the wellbeing of all citizens young and old. economic challenges and policy measures madame president, as it relates to our economic challenges and policy measures, my country as a commodity-based export economy, is highly vulnerable to commodity price shocks. the sharp downturn in gold and oil prices 3 years ago and the closure of the century-old bauxite operations in 2016 ha e led to a sharp recession and a severe loss in government revenues. the economy contracted by a combined 8% during 2015-16, while the government lost more than a third of its fiscal revenue in terms of gdp during 2012-1 7. this required unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy adjustments. to stabilize the exchange rate, reduce domestic demand, and reestablish a viable balance of payments position, the monetar authorities moved to a flexible exchange rate regime and sharply curtailed credit creation in the country, with credit to the private sector falling from 37% of gdp in 2016 to 28% in 2017. since october 2016, the exchange rate has stabilized, monthly inflation rates have fallen to less than one percent, and the current account deficit in the balance of payments has vanished. the fiscal response, usually a much more difficult undertaking, began in earnest in august 2015 with a massive contraction in government expenditure and increases in taxation. while the crisis continued to erode revenue in terms of gdp, expenditure was cut from more than 30% of gdp in 2015 to less than 23% in 2017. 3 ypb as a result, the unsustainable 10% of gdp deficit that emerged during the crisis years has already been cut to an estimated 5% of gdp in 2018. looking ahead, the government also put in place significant reforms to limit the impact of future export commodity shocks. institutional reforms will help promote foreign direct investment aimed at diversifying the economy away from its heavy reliance on extractive industries; fiscal reforms aim at reducing reliance on direct tax income and broadening the tax base; and the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund will stabilize income derived from extractive industries and help mitigate the fiscal impact of future shocks. our efforts have borne fruit, and the government is committed to continuing the fiscal efforts to restore the primary fiscal surplus that was typical in suriname. the international monetary fund and inte ational rating agencies have commended the efforts and foresee a continued improvement in the macroeconomic performance of suriname. black-listing, de-riskin and the graduation to middle income country these efforts to steer us on the right path of development are worsened by obstacles that are unjustifiable, and not of our making. first of all, madame president, i wish to refer to the matter of the classification of suriname as a middle income country, which i alluded to at this very rostrum last year, but which remains unresolved. our classification, like many other developing countries, including the caribbean, based on gdp per capita, does not reflect our vulnerabilities. we strongly reject this unrealistic classification which disregards the full set of challenges that we face. this is a matter, madame president, which should be addressed with urgency. access to concessional financing for our development is critical, to allow for the implementation of programs to benefit all our citizens. correspondent banking and de-risking, further aggravated by unilateral actions, among which blacklisting and the arbitrary seizure of funds, without due regard to the severe consequences to the community, including businesses and families, remain obstacles that we do not have ny influence on. an atmosphere of trust and political ill is crucial and should lead to dialo ue and cooperation in order to address all matters of concern. mitigating the effects of climate change 4 ypb madame president, although suriname contributes significantly to the mitigation of the effects of climate change through its high forest cover and low deforestation rate, it is regrettable to acknowledge that global commitments, based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, have yet to be materialized into tangible results. su iname is one of the 11 countries with a high forest cover and low deforestation rate, representing 20 percent of the earth s remaining tropical forests, and storing 18 percent of tropical forest carbon. yet, we are not fully benefitting from lobal arrangements associated with sound forest management. at cop23 (unfccc climate change conference), last year, suriname pledged to cap its forests at 93%. we also made the conditional commitment to maintain our leadership position as one of the most carbon negative countries. this pledge, subject to scientific, technological, technical and financial support, goes beyond national benefits into the realm of global gains for humanity. it is against this reality, that suriname will host a high level conference on climate finance mobilization in februar of next year. this conference will seek to initiate and implement new economic models of eco-sustainability to improve the quality of life for all. combating the illicit drug trade madam president, the scourges of illicit drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, terrorism as well as trafficking in arms and persons, place an unprecedented burden on the financial and human resource capacity of small developing countries, hampering their ability to implement policy measures ai ed at achieving development objectives. drug abuse and drug trafficking destroy families, disrupt communities and rob our youth from a productive future. 5 ypb and our open borders compel us to strengthen the coo eration with adjacent, neighboring and other countries to effectively combat transnational organized crime and the negative consequences associated with it. such cooperation must yield results and we join others in the fight against the world drug problem. we need more than lip service. we need joint action! likewise, we solicit international cooperation to protect our unique biodiversity which is under threat, through illegal poaching and trade in endangered species. bilateral, re ional and international/multilateral cooperation madame president, as it relates to our collabo ation at the bilateral, sub- regional and ultilateral levels, suriname continues to stand for international peace and security. we advocate for dialog in any e isting conflict and uphold internationally accepted principles of non-interference, non- intervention, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. suriname respects and protects all human rights, however, we strongly reject usin human rights for political gains. all conflicts that arise, are a consequence of departing from these valued principles. that is why i wish to reiterate, madam president, that these valued principles form the bedrock of suriname s foreign policy. in the same vein, my country applauds those who have chosen the path of dialog to resolve their disputes. in this regard, allow me to refer to the rapprochement between countries in the horn of africa, and on the korean peninsula. 6 ypb diversification of bilateral and regional partners madame president, our geographic location, positions us as a strategic hub. as such, suriname has strengthened its bonds with neighboring and adjacent countries and with those we enjoy re arkable historic ties with. as we strengthen partnerships based on mutual respect and benefit, we seek to advance our national development objectives with a focus on agriculture and tourism, through foreign direct investments, south-south cooperation and regional partnerships. suriname, with its human capital as its greatest asset, an abundance of natural resources such as fresh water, oil, gold, bauxite and other minerals, maintains warm and friendly relations with many countries. we focus on reinforcing existing partnerships and initiating new ones. as a result, many friends from all corners of the world are seeking to forge durable partnerships on the basis of mutual respect and benefit. madame president, the latin american and caribbean region has not been spared from tensions due to existing differences of opinion on various issues. the proclamation of the region as a zone of peace in 2014 has certainly contributed to ensuring that there is no room for military adventures. we stron ly appeal for dialo ue where there are differences. we must prevent outside forces to i pose their own agenda upon us, contrary to our interests as a region. let us focus on what binds us, and not what divides us! economic warfare it is reprehensible that some economically powerful countries resort to applying unilateral sanctions when they encounter ideological, political or trade differences. this economic warfare does not bode well in solving disputes. on the contrary, positions are hardened with far reaching consequences for regional and international stability, peace and security. 7 ypb suriname strongly rejects these coercive economic and trade measures since they are counter-productive and create an atmosphere of distrust, making a peaceful resolution of disputes almost out of reach. in this regard, we disapprove of the continuation of the economic, financial and commercial embargo against cuba and its people. time and again, the majority of nations takes a stand against this embargo. is it now, madame president, not the time to honor the demand of the majority of the international communit and put an end to the blockade? madame president, the current ar s race is deplorable and it absorbs tremendous resources. imagine what we could have achieved in making the world more humane if these resources where simply channeled to combating disease and hunger, improving food safety and securit . who would not aspire to these sustainable goals, eradicating poverty and hunger? like many other countries, we call for an end to the arms race, while also rejecting the militarization of outer space and the research of artificial intelligence for warfare purposes. multilateralism madame president, multilateralism remains essential for undertaking joint actions in achieving sustainable development and in addressing matters of global concerns such as maintaining peace and security, combating terrorism and transnational organized crime and addressing climate change. suriname supports these initiatives as we seek to reinforce the validity of multilateralism based on the principles and purposes of the united nations. the way forward madame president, we are convinced that the united nations remains the most important organization to discuss all matters confronting the international communit , aimed at finding solutions and taking into consideration the interests of its me ber states. it is therefore essential to make this 8 ypb institution more relevant than it is today, by making it more democratic, transparent and accountable. continued efforts to reform the united nations remain crucial to reflect the realities of today s world. for example, the process to reform the security council must be comprehensive, inclusive, balanced and consensus-based, taking into account the interests of both developed and developing countries and further promoting, preserving and strengthening international peace and security. madame president, your priorities for the 73rd session have been noted and suriname is fully supportive as together we try to make this or anization relevant again. we have to ensure tha our youth is engaged and participates in a structured manner in the affairs of this world organization, recognizing that they are a demographic dividend for development and have a unique and innovative perception on matters. as lead head in the caribbean community for youth development, suriname wholeheartedly supports the sentiments expressed earlier in the debate, to create a united nations agency dealing with youth. i expect that the recently launched un youth strategy will be inclusive and deliver on the aspirations of the world’s young people. madam president, in the final analysis, when suriname speaks, e speak to give strength to the voices of all countries, whether small or big, developed or developing. we ust globally recommit to the principle of dialog and the cause of lasting peace. this recommitment that i call us all to embrace, is the inherent right to decent life and protection for all who are born on this planet. through our organization, we have at our disposal all the means to take on this responsibility. 9 ypb we have no one but ourselves do this for us. let me concl de, madam president, by saying that if there were no united nations, today, we would be calling for its creation. therefore, as i said before, let us focus on what binds us, rather than hat divides us. god bless you, thank you!! 10","yldiz pollack-beigle, minister for foreign affairs of suriname, said a rules‑based world order with the united nations at its center is needed to address global concerns. noting that the mitigation of climate change requires the mobilization of funds, she pointed out that suriname is among the most threatened countries that are directly impacted by the rise of sea levels. approximately 80 per cent of its population resides in the coastal area, where its main productive activities are also concentrated. the forces of nature which recently struck again in the caribbean and elsewhere are evidence the international community must move beyond the rhetoric and take immediate action. as a commodity‑based export economy, suriname is facing economic challenges, she noted. the downturn in gold and oil prices three years ago and the closure of the century‑old bauxite operations in 2016 have caused the economy to contract. the government lost a third of its fiscal revenue. it put in place significant reforms that have borne fruit, but the country still faces obstacles that are unjustifiable, notably its classification as a middle‑income country. this classification based on gross domestic product (gdp) per capita does not reflect her country’s vulnerabilities. “we strongly reject this unrealistic classification which disregards the full set of challenges that we face,” she stated. underlining that access to concessional financing is critical, she said an atmosphere of trust and political will is crucial to address all matters of concern through dialog. suriname contributes significantly to the mitigation of the effects of climate change through its high forest cover and low deforestation rate, she pointed out. yet, global commitments based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities have yet to be materialized. what is more, suriname does not fully benefit from global arrangements associated with sound forest management even though it stores 18 per cent of tropical forest carbon. in that context, her country will host a high‑level conference on climate finance mobilization in february 2019, aiming to initiate and implement new models of eco‑sustainability to improve the quality of life for all. due to its open borders, suriname is strengthening its cooperation with adjacent and other countries to effectively combat transnational organized crime and its consequences, she continued. international cooperation has been solicited to protect her country’s unique biodiversity that is threatened by poaching and the illegal trade in endangered species. regarding trade, she said it is reprehensible that economically powerful countries resort to unilateral sanctions when they encounter ideological, political or trade differences, and voiced disapproval for the continuation of the financial and commercial embargo against cuba and its people. reaffirming that multilateralism remains essential, she stressed the need to make the united nations more relevant by making it more democratic, transparent and accountable."
Sweden,"national statement at the 73rd session of the united national general assembly, delivered by ambassador olof skoog on behalf of sweden 1 october 2018 mr. president, secretary-general, excellencies just a bit more than a week ago, we honored late secretary general kofi annan in this hall. it was a sad but dignified occasion. it was an inspiration as we set out on this 73d general assembly. we were reminded of the unique value of the united nations and the responsibility we, its members, have towards the people of the world - to promote peace, development and equal rights. and as kofi annan once said, i quote: “we don’t need any more promises. we need to start keeping the promises we have already made.” and, yes, the time to act upon our joint commitments is indeed here. sweden strives to act in accordance with its promises. we believe in international cooperation, in shared responsibility and participation. we believe in a rules-based order where international treaties and agreements are respected. excellencies, when sweden sought your support to serve on the security council, we promised to act on several urgent priorities on behalf of all of you. we continue to do our outmost to keep those promises. let me give only a few examples. we have worked consistently to reverse the trend of disrespect for international humanitarian law and to ensure humanitarian access to all those in need. we have insisted on diplomacy and political solutions to entrenched conflicts. that members of the security council, shoulder their responsibilities under the un charter including to resist the use of the veto. we have always sought meaningful decisions and outcomes that make a difference for people on the ground. we have tried to translate the secretary-general’s vision for improved prevention, into practice. we have aimed at introducing an all-inclusive approach to peace, including by analyzing new risks such as climate change and the risk of famine. we have focused on ensuring the care, safety and protection of children today, as it prevents conflicts tomorrow. platforms for stronger influence of youth has been introduced. and not least, we’ve has worked tirelessly and systematically to strengthen the role of women in order for the us to better sustain and build peace. we will continue to demand women’s participation in peace processes, that women’s voices are heard in negotiations and in the security council, that un mission’s mandates include a women, peace and security perspective, that gender posts in missions continue to be funded and that gender aspects are systematically included in mission reporting and monitoring. we have also ensured that civil society are heard at the council table and to deepen the partnership with regional organizations. mr. president, however, in too many instances, the security council, as a collective, have failed to deliver on promises to the people we are meant to serve. in syria and yemen, two of the worst humanitarian disasters of our time, humanitarian access is continuously denied and international humanitarian law blatantly disregarded. in syria, a political solution to the conflict is long overdue. horrendous crimes are being committed against the civilian population. we must work tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice, however long it may take. in yemen we have yet to see a full commitment by all to what the security council has clearly stated – that there can be no military solution. instead of committing to a political process we see an escalation of the conflict and a deterioration of an already horrific humanitarian situation. the suffering of the stateless rohingya population of myanmar continues. the un fact-finding mission recently presented solid evidence of the gravity of atrocities committed by the myanmar military, amounting to the worst crimes under international law. since myanmar systematically has failed to condemn, investigate and prosecute perpetrators, the international community must shoulder its responsibility and act to end impunity. the rohingyas should be able to return voluntarily and in safety, the kofi annan plan be implemented and credible peace processes for the outstanding conflicts be pursued. a middle east peace process remains elusive, and instead a rapid negative development is unfolding, including the continued disregard for international humanitarian law. 70 years after the un partition plan, and in spite of calls for un resolutions to be respected, fulfilling the promise of a two-state solution – with israel and palestine living side by side in peace and security, and with jerusalem as capital of both states, seems very far away. russia’s illegal annexation of crimea and the aggression in eastern ukraine constitute violations of international law. to date, this has caused over 10.000 deaths and unacceptable human suffering. the commitments made in the helsinki final act and the budapest memorandum must be honored, and the full implementation of the minsk agreements assured. excellencies, in the absence of political solutions and in the face of ongoing conflicts, the humanitarian efforts must be reinforced and protected. we pay tribute to the courageous and selfless efforts of all humanitarian workers worldwide. sweden has continued to deliver on our commitment to support strong, effective and principled humanitarian action worldwide. we have increased our financial contributions to the un-led global humanitarian response system and improved the effectiveness of our common efforts through our engagement in the grand bargain-process. we have also enhanced the way we link our humanitarian assistance with longer-term development assistance. let us not forget. there are also positive dynamics, reminding us to keep up hope and never give up the quest for peace also in the most difficult circumstances and entrenched conflicts. in the horn of africa there is positive change. a testament to what a difference courageous leaders and people can make. let us encourage and recognize this historic development, support its fulfillment and allow it to serve as an inspiration to us all. on the korean peninsula, there is hope that a political solution will emerge from years of escalation, high tension and mistrust. there is unity in the security council toward our common goal of complete denuclearization, peace and reconciliation on the korean peninsula through diplomatic means. excellencies, the 2030 agenda also brings hope. the commitments we have collectively made, puts an enormous responsibility upon us all. we need the un to assist us. the reforms initiated by the secretary-general, to make the un more fit for purpose, are creating better conditions for us to move from promises to action. sweden lives up to our promise to annually provide one percent of our gdi in official development assistance. more than 50 percent is channeled to or through the multilateral system. this reflects our belief in multilateralism and the 2030 agenda as central plan for our common future. it will require a multilateral system that is cost-effective, coherent, accountable, agile and delivers results for people. the funding compact between the un and its member states is a unique opportunity. we, the member states, need to improve the quality of our funding of the un. sweden have already taken steps by signing multi-year agreements of core support to un women, undp, unicef, unfpa, cerf, unhcr, unwra and wfp this year. core funding is crucial for the independent delivery and efficiency of the development system. mr. president, another global promise was made in paris, when we all agreed to seriously and urgently address climate change. the gap between current commitments and the required emissions reductions under the paris agreement is alarmingly large. the eu has made important progress towards reaching the targets, but we must all do more. sweden has adopted a climate policy framework, which establishes that sweden will have netzero emissions in 2045. we have also taken a leading role in climate finance and we remain firmly committed to our share of mobilizing the 100 billion usd annually by 2020. excellencies, this year marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the rome statute, by which the international criminal court was established – a milestone for accountability. political will and cooperation remain crucial for the court in carrying out its mandate. we will continue to honor its promise to support the court, its independence and impartiality. sweden will also continue to stand up for the protection and promotion of human rights. there will be no development without security, nor security without development and we will not enjoy neither without universal respect for human rights. global forced migration remains a challenge to many countries and more cooperation is needed to share the responsibility for the world's refugees. at the un summit on refugees and migrants on september 19, 2016, it was decided to work out two global frameworks – one on refugees and one on migration. these will increase the cooperation, accountability and structure to better manage the increasing refugee and migratory flows we see today. excellencies, in his comprehensive and timely agenda for disarmament, the secretary-general clearly articulated that measures for arms control and disarmament play a critical role for the prevention of armed conflict. groundbreaking international commitments have been reached. at the same time the field of disarmament remains filled with broken and unfulfilled promises. we are witnessing a deeply worrisome nuclear renaissance, with vast modernizations of nuclear arsenals underway. nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states should heed the call of the secretary-general to engage in a dialog and confidence building aiming at reducing risks and breaking the stalemate plaguing disarmament diplomacy. the npt framework is ideally suited for such efforts. excellencies, how can we work towards fulfilling our promises to 50 percent of the world’s population who are women and girls? sweden has focused on promoting equal access to rights, representation and resources. women’s voices cannot be ignored anymore, women must be included everywhere, all the time and at all levels. global normative frameworks and international commitments on gender equality and human rights are increasingly under attack, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights. more needs to be done to combat sexual harassment and sexual violence everywhere, in workplaces and society at large. this pertains also to the un system. the un zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse as well as sexual harassment and assault must urgently be turned into practice. we welcome the secretary-general’s gender parity strategy that has made gender balance the new standard. mr. president, we are about to close the high-level segment of this general assembly. in the very first intervention last week, the secretary-general set out the challenges to our world. deficit of trust. and the need to show the added value of international cooperation by delivering on the promise of peace, defending human rights and driving economic and social progress for women and men everywhere. mr. president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, international cooperation, and a well-functioning multilateralism at its core, is the best tool we have. so, let us be the generation that acted on our promises - not just as independent states, but as united nations. thank you very much.","olof skoog (sweden) said the passing of former secretary‑general kofi annan reminded the world of the unique value of the united nations and the responsibility of its members in promoting peace, development and equal rights. indeed, sweden believes in international cooperation, shared responsibility and participation, as well as a rules‑based order where international treaties and agreements are respected. condemning the disrespect for international humanitarian law, he called for diplomatic solutions to entrenched conflicts as well as the increased participation of women in peace processes to better build and sustain peace. however, in too many instances the security council has failed to deliver on its promises to those it is meant to serve, he continued. in syria and yemen — two of the worst humanitarian disasters of our time — humanitarian access is continuously denied and international humanitarian law blatantly disregarded, he said. meanwhile, the suffering of the stateless rohingya population of myanmar continues. noting that myanmar has systematically failed to condemn, investigate and prosecute perpetrators, he called on the international community to shoulder its responsibility and act to end its impunity. he went on to highlight the middle east peace process, saying that it remains an “illusion” that is rapidly unfolding. indeed, 70 years after the united nations partition plan, fulfilling the promise of a two‑state solution seems very far away. in the face of ongoing conflicts, humanitarian efforts must be reinforced and protected, he continued. for its part, sweden increased its financial contributions to the united nations‑led global humanitarian response system and improved the effectiveness of its common efforts through engagement in the grand bargain process. citing the horn of africa as an encouraging example, he said positive dynamics in the region are a testament to what a difference courageous leaders and peoples can make. after years of escalation, high tension and mistrust on the korean peninsula, he also expressed hope that a political solution can emerge in that region, emphasizing the common goal of complete denuclearization, peace and reconciliation through diplomatic means."
Switzerland,,"alain berset, president of switzerland, described a range of challenges including globalization, inequality, war and internal conflict, extremism, migration flows, climate change, health crises and the digital revolution. united nations member states must ensure that international institutions and organizations can address those challenges. however, he pointed to a “real crisis in multilateralism” when we are trying to forge the main pillars of future global governance. citing ongoing global crises particularly in the middle east, he said that switzerland is working for a just and lasting peace between israelis and palestinians based on a negotiated two-state solution in compliance with international law and relevant security council resolutions. with the conflict in syria entering its eighth year, the basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law and human rights are not respected. more than 13 million men, women and children depend upon humanitarian aid, demanding we step up efforts for a political solution. similarly, in yemen, the ongoing armed conflict has deprived millions of water, food and medical care. he called on all parties to cease hostilities and come to the negotiating table. these conflicts bring about large-scale health issues, he continued. the spread of disease, especially in war zones and refugee camps, overburdens weakened health systems and requires vital protection of facilities and personnel to maintain access to medical care. the united nations must be strong to fulfill its role as the cornerstone of peaceful coexistence between all states. accordingly, switzerland supports reform programs launched by the secretary-general in peace and security, development and management. determined to build a “better multiculturalism” beyond the talking stage, he said that his country is working to implement the 2030 agenda and its 17 sustainable development goals, aiming to establish a robust monitoring mechanism that provides for voluntary national reviews and progress reports. still, efforts are needed to combat global warming and negative environmental impacts of economic development. he stressed the importance of culture and cultural diversity in stimulating economic, social and environmental sustainability. he said that switzerland supports the human rights council, the international criminal court and united nations high commissioner for human rights, as respect for human dignity and fundamental rights are not optional. international cooperation is essential to preventing conflict and establishing a framework for lasting peace. he mentioned in particular the fight against impunity, as switzerland worked for the adoption of the rome statute and the creation of the international criminal court 20 years ago. turning to switzerland’s good offices, he said the country makes all necessary preparations “so that discreet peace talks of the kind undertaken by the parties to the conflicts in syria or yemen can take place”. as the home to several united nations agencies, geneva is a platform for dialog on new challenges in politics, society, innovation, science and economics. noting that trade protectionism and selfish interests “are enjoying a certain popularity at present”, he said such policies can only lead to a fall in trade and resulting decline in prosperity. describing that selfishness as a “malaise”, he said, “the world is not a zero‑sum game. it is a positive‑sum game where cooperation creates only winners.”"

assembly new york september 29''', 2018 madam president of the 73''*' session of the united nations general assembly, i would like to congratulate you and your country ecuador on your election as president of the current session of the general assembly and i wish you all success. i would also like to thankyour predecessor for presiding over the assembly during the previous session. madam president, ladies and gentlemen. every year we arrive at this important international forum, hoping that every comer of this world has become more secure, stable, and prosperous. today, our hope is stronger than ever, and so is our confidence that the will of the people shall eventually triumph. our hope and confidence are the result of more than seven years of hardship, during which our people suffered from the scourge of terrorism. however, syrians refused to compromise. they refused to succumb to terrorist groups and their extemal supporters. they stood their ground. they remained defiant, fully convinced that this was a battle for their existence, their history, and their future, and that they will ultimately emerge victorious. to the disappointment of some, here we are today, more than seven years into this dirty war against my country, announcing to the world that the situation on the ground has become more secure and stable and that our war on terror is almost over, thanks to the heroism, resolve, and unity of the people and the army, and to the support of our allies and friends. however, we will not stop at these achievements. we remain committed to fighting this sacred battle until we purge all syrian territories from terrorist groups, regardless of their names, and from any illegal foreign presence. we will pay no heed to any attacks, extemal pressure, lies or allegations that seek to discourage us. this is our duty and a non-negotiable right that we have exercised as we set out to eradicate terrorism from our land. madam president, the governments of certain countries have denied us our right, under intemational law, and our national duty to combat terrorism and protect our people on our land and within our own borders. at the same time, these governments formed an illegitimate intemational coalition, led by the united states, on the pretext of combating terrorism in syria. the so-called intemationd coalition has done everything but fight terrorism. it has even become clear that the coalition's goals were in perfect alignment with those of terrorist groups; sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path. the coalition destroyed the syrian city of raqqa completely; it destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas it targeted; it committed massacres against civilians, including children and women, which amount to war crimes under intemational law. the coalition has also provided direct military support to terrorists, on multiple occasions, as they fought against the syrian army. it should have been more aptly named 'the coalition to support terrorists and war crimes'. the situation in syria cannot be divorced from the battle raging between two camps on the world stage: one of the camps promotes peace, stability, and prosperity across the world, advocates dialog and mutual understanding, respects intemational law, and upholds the principle of non-interference in the intemal affairs of other states. the other camp tries to create chaos in intemational relations and employs colonization and hegemony as tools to further its narrow interests, even if that meant resorting to conupt methods, such as supporting terrorism and imposing an economic blockade, to subjugate people and governments that reject extemal diktats and insist on making their own decisions. what happened in syria should have been a lesson to some countries but those countries refuse to leam. instead, they choose to bury their head in the sand. this is why ladies and gentlemen we, the members of this organization, must make a clear and unequivocal choice: are we going to defend intemational law and the un cheirter and be on the side ofjustice? or are we going to submit to hegemonic tendencies and the law of the jungle that some are trying to impose on this organization and the world? ladies and gentlemen, today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism. the government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy. all conditions are now present for the voluntary retum of syrian refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that - targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods. thousands of syrian refugees abroad have indeed started their journey back home. the return of every syrian refugee is a priority for the syrian state. doors are open for all syrians abroad to return voluntarily and safely. and what applies to syrians inside syria also applies to syrians abroad. no one is above the law. thanks to the help of russia, the syrian government will spare no effort to facilitate the return of those refugees and meet their basic needs. a special committee was recently established to coordinate the return of refugees to their placesof origin in syriaand to help them regaintheir lives. we have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns. however, some western countries and in line with their dishonest behavior since the start of the war on syria continue to prevent the return of refugees. they are spreading irrational fears among refugees; they are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue, using refugees as a bargaining chip to serve their political agenda, and linking the return of refugees to the political process. today, as we are about to close the last chapter in the crisis, syrians are coming together to erase the traces of this terrorist war and to rebuild their country with their own hands, whether they stayed in syria or were forced to leave. we welcome any assistance with reconstruction from those countries that were not part of the aggression on syria and those that have come out clearly and explicitly against terrorism. however, the priority is for our fnends that stood by us in our war on terror. as for the countries that offer only conditional assistance or continue to support terrorism, they are neither invited nor welcome to help. madam president, as we move ahead on counter-terrorism, reconstruction and the return of refugees, we remain committed to the political process without compromising on our national principles. these include preserving the sovereignty, independence, and territorial unity of the syrian arab republic, protecting the exclusive right of syrians to determine the future of their country without external interference, and eradicating terrorism from our country. we expressed time and again our readiness to respond to any initiative that would help syrians end the crisis. we have -3 - engaged positively in the geneva talks, the astana process and the syrian national dialog in sochi, however, it has always been the other parties that rejected dialog and resorted to terrorism and foreign interferenceto achieve their goals. nevertheless, we continue to implement the outcomes of the sochi syrian national dialog on the formation of a constitutional committee to review the current constitution. we presented a practical and comprehensive vision on the composition, prerogatives and working methods of the committee and submitted a list of representatives on behalf of the syrian state. we stress that the mandate of the committee is limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, through a syrian-led and syrian-owned process that may be facilitated by the special envoy of the secretary-general for syria. no preconditions should be imposed on the committee, nor should its recommendations be prejudged. the committee must be independent since the constitution is a syrian matter to be decided by syrians themselves. therefore, we will not accept any proposal that constitutes an interference in the internal affairs of syria or leads to such interference. the syrian people must have the final word regarding any constitutional or sovereign matter. we stand ready to work actively with our friends to convene the committee along the parameters i have just mentioned. in addition to these intemational initiatives, local reconciliation is well underway. reconciliation agreements allowed us to stem the bloodshed and prevent destruction in many areas around syria. they restored stability and a normal life to these areas and allowed people to retum to the homes they were forced to leave because of terrorism. reconciliation, therefore, will remain our priority. ladies and gentlemen, the battle we fought in syria against terrorism was not only a military one. it was also an ideological battle, between the culture of destruction, extremism, and death, and the culture of construction, tolerance, and life. therefore, i launch an appeal from this rostrum, calling for fighting the ideology of terrorism and violent extremism, drying up its support and financial resources, and implementing relevant security council resolutions, notably resolution 2253. the - v - military battle against terrorism, albeit important, is not enough. terrorism is like an epidemic. it will retum, break out, and threaten everyone without exception. madam president, ladies and gentlemen, we fully condemn and reject the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, wherever, whenever, and regardless of the target. this is why syria eliminated completely its chemical program and fulfilled all its commitments as a member of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (opcw), as confirmed by numerous opcw reports. although some western countries are constantly trying to politicize its work, we have always cooperated with the opcw to the largest extent possible. unfortunately, every time we express our readiness to receive objective and professional investigative teams to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons, these countries would block such efforts because they know that the conclusions of the investigations would not satisfy the ill-intentions they harbor ageiinst sjnria. these countries have ready-made accusations and scenarios to justify an aggression on syria. this was the case when the united states, france, and the uk launched a wanton aggression on syria last april, claiming that chemical weapons were used without any investigation or evidence and in a flagrant violation of syria's sovereignty, international law and the un charter. meanwhile, these same countries disregarded all reliable information we provided on chemical weapons in the possession of terrorist groups that used them on multiple occasions to blame the syrian government and justify an attack against it. the terrorist organization known as 'the white helmets' was the main tool used to mislead public opinion and fabricate accusations and come up with lies on the use of chemical weapons in syria. the white helmets was created by british intelligence under a humanitarian cover. it has been proven however that this organization is part of the al-qaida-affiliated nosra front. despite all allegations, we remain committed to liberating all our territory without concem for the black banners of terrorists or the theatrics of the white helmets. ladies and gentlemen. in another episode of the terrorist war on syria since 2011, suicide bombings orchestrated by isil rocked the govemorate of suwayda in southem syria last july. it is worth noting that the -5 - terrorists behind that attack came from the tanf area where us forces are present. the area has become a safe haven for isil remnants who are now hiding in the rukban refugee camp on the border with jordan, under the protection of us forces. the united states also sought to prolong the crisis in syria by releasing terrorists from guantanamo prison and sending them to syria, where they became the effective leaders of the nosra front and other terrorist groups. meanwhile, the turkish regime continues to support terrorists in syria. since day one of the war on syria, the turkish regime has trained and armed terrorists, turning turkey into a hub and a corridor for terrorists on their way to syria. when terrorists failed to serve its agenda, the turkish regime resorted to direct military aggression, attacking cities and towns in northem syria. however, all these actions that undermine syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity and violate international law will not stop us from exercising our rights and fulfilling our duties to recover our land and purge it from terrorists, whether through military action or reconciliation agreements. we have always been open to any initiative that prevents further deaths and restores safety and security to areas affected by terrorism. that is why we welcomed the agreement on idlib reached in sochi on september 17^. the agreement was the result of intensive consultations and fiill coordination between syria and russia. the agreement is timebound, includes clear deadlines, and complements the agreements on the de-escalation zones reached in astana. we hope that when the agreement is implemented, the nosra front and other terrorist groups will be eradicated, thus eliminating the last remnants of terrorism in syria. any foreign presence on syrian territory without the consent of the syrian government is illegal and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and the un charter. it is an assault on our sovereignty, which undermines counter-terrorism efforts and threatens regional peace and security. we therefore consider any forces operating on syrian territory without an explicit request from the sjnian government, including us, french, and turkish forces, occupying forces and will be dealt with accordingly. they must withdraw immediately and without conditions. ladies and gentlemen, israel continues to occupy a dear part of our land in the syrian golan and our people there continue to suffer because of its oppressive and aggressive policies. israel even supported -6 ^ terrorist groups that operated in southern syria; protecting them through direct military intervention and laimching repeated attacks on syria. but just as we liberated southern syria from terrorists, we are determined to liberate fully the occupied syrian golan to the lines of june 4^^, 1967. syria demands that the international community put an end to all these practices and compel israel to implement relevant un resolutions, notably resolution 497 on the occupied syrian golan. the international community must also help the palestinian people establish its own independent state, with jerusalem as its capital, and facilitate the return of palestine refugees to their land, pursuant to international resolutions. any actions that undermine these rights are null and void and threaten regional peace and security, especially the israeli racist law known as ""the nation-state law"" and the decision of the us administration to move the us embassy to jerusalem and stop funding unrwa. madam president, syria strongly condemns the decision of the us administration to withdraw from the iran nuclear agreement, which proves once again the united states' disregard for international treaties and conventions. we express once again our solidarity with the leaders and people of the islamic republic of iran and trust that they will overcome the effects of this irresponsible decision. we also stand vrith the government and people of venezuela in the face of us attempts to interfere in their internal affairs. we call once again for lifting the unilateral economic measures against the syrian people and all other independent people around the world, especially the people of the dprk, cuba, and belarus. madam president, ladies and gentlemen, with the help of allies and friends, syria will defeat terrorism. the world must never forget that and should treat us accordingly. it is time for all those detached from reality to wake up, let go of their fantasies, and come to their senses. they must realize that they vrill not achieve politically what they failed to achieve by force. we have never compromised on our national principles even when the war was at its peak. we will surely not do that today! at the same time, we want peace for the people of the world because we want peace for our people. we have never attacked others. we have never interfered in the affairs of others. we have never exported _ n - terrorists to other parts of the world. we have always maintained the best relations with other countries. today, as we seek to defeat terrorism, we continue to advocate dialog and mutual understanding to serve the interests of our people and to achieve security, stability, and prosperity for all. -a ^","walid al-moualem, minister for foreign affairs and expatriates of syria, said it has been more than seven years since the beginning of the dirty war against syria. his country remains committed to fighting until all terrorist groups, as well as any illegal foreign presence, are purged from syrian territories. certain states have denied syria its right, under international law, and its national

Tajikistan,"permanent mission of tajikistan to the united nations 216 east 49* str., new york, n.y. 10017; tel: (212) 207-3315; fax: (212) 207-3855; e-mail: tajimstanun@mfa.tj statement by h.e. mr. mahmadamin mahmadaminov permanent representative of the republic of tajikistan to the un, head of the delegation of the republic of tajikistan at the general debates of the 73rd unga session making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies distinguished madam president, at the outset, on behalf of the government of the republic of tajikistan, i would like to extend to the president of the 73rdsession of the united nations general assembly, maria fernanda espinosa garces, our sincere congratulations on her well-deserved election. we are confident that her wisdom, diplomatic experience and skills will contribute to the success of the current session of the united nations general assembly. she can rest assured of my delegation's constant support and cooperation in this regard. i would also like to take this opportunity to commend h.e. mr.miroslav lajcak, the president of the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly for his able leadership during the previous unga session. distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, we live in an ever-changing world. the unprecedented level of instability and uncertainty is on the rise in many parts of the world. global challenges such as climate change, terrorism and extremism, large-scale conflicts, inequality, poverty, food and water security, lack of education and economic opportunities, unemployment, to name a few, further affect the status quo. today s global challenges exert pressure on the very foundations of the world order and principles of international relations. they undermine the efforts of the international community at achieving the 2030 agenda and its sustainable development goals. under these circumstances, making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies becomes very pertinent. and using the words of our former un secretary-general, the great diplomat and outstanding human being, late kofi annan, who said we have a tendency to go through life as a individuals and organizations, often focusing and stressing. this is what we do. but that is the wrong question. we should be asking what should we be doing in this changing world. the world is changing and the un has to change and adapt with it. we can not be static . as a universal institution, the un should continue carrying out its noble mission of coordinating the efforts of its member states to enhance the resilience of the countries to respond to the modern threats and challenges. 2 at the same time, member states shall also play an active part in this process by meeting their commitments undertaken in 2030 agenda, addis ababa action agenda and paris agreement, to restore stability and thereby to ensure development. full implementation of the above milestone documents is required to address many of the socio¬ economic problems, the main drivers of extremism and terrorism. madam president, my country believes that the response to the ever-increasing threat of terrorism and violent extremism should be comprehensive, with the un as a key coordinator. the efforts should be focused on the elimination of the military infrastructure of international terrorism, on depriving it of political, military and financial support; on prevention of the use of the icts for radicalization of minds, recruitment and propaganda of extremism and violence. to discuss the issues, the government of the republic of tajikistan, in close cooperation with the united nations, the organization for security and cooperation in europe, the european union and some partner countries, convened in dushanbe on 3-4 may 2018 the high-level international conference countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism , we are confident that the dushanbe conference served as an excellent platform for constructive and fruitful cooperation, inter alia, contributed to the achievement of a general recognition of the negative impact and consequences of the current challenges; exploring possibilities for strengthening partnership and cooperation at all levels and exchanging experiences in countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism. furthermore, to address the evolving transnational threat posed by the terrorist group and its affiliates member states and the un system should continue to strengthen and promote the effective use of necessary tools and measures. it is essential that we jointly search for ways of addressing the issues of poverty, the negative impact of globalization, preventing and resolving conflicts. there is also a need to strengthen an intercultural and interfaith dialog, mutual trust and tolerance. in this context, the united nations remains a critically important platform for achieving consensus on the main issues of international security and development, as well as for coordination of joint actions of the international community in addressing challenges and threats of the contemporary world. madam president, peace is the main prerequisite for creating equitable and sustainable societies across the world. therefore, we believe that stable peace in the middle east can be achieved only through a comprehensive settlement of the crisis, which in turn will contribute to enhancing global security. we support international and regional efforts aimed at restoring and strengthening peace and stability in the middle east, including the efforts towards resumption and acceleration of the credible negotiations within the middle east peace process. we also support the international strategy for a comprehensive settlement and post-conflict rehabilitation in afghanistan. we need to strengthen our assistance to the government of afghanistan, especially during afghanistan s transformation decade (2015-2024). 3 urgent socio-economic recovery is a must for development and prosperity of afghanistan. targeted assistance to this war-torn country aimed at economic recovery, strengthening the social sphere and creation of new jobs should be expanded. to this end, the involvement of afghanistan in the process of multifaceted regional cooperation is critical for the success of the efforts undertaken by the international community. we are willing to take part in the rehabilitation of the social and economic infrastructure of afghanistan through connecting the transport arteries of our two countries, creating an energy bridge casa-1000, providing the afghan population with essential commodities and training specialists. distinguished colleagues, we are in the third year of the implementation of the 2030 agenda and its sustainable development goals. the recent high-level political forum has vividly demonstrated that despite certain progress there are early signs that the countries are not on track to reach sdgs by 2030. it is alarming to observe this situation, particularly at the stage, when the countries just started incorporating/aligning the 2030 agenda with their national development strategies. the mistakes of the mdg era should not be repeated. for this reason, there is an urgent need to step up efforts on all fronts aimed at achieving our ambitious goal - to transform our world for better by 2030. the first step to be undertaken is to strengthen the means of implementation, especially for the developing countries. mobilization of financial resources, including oda, long-term investments, revitalized global partnerships, capacity building and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to the developing countries are needed to adequately and timely attain sdgs by 2030. secondly, the national development efforts need to be supported by an enabling international economic environment. it is essential to revitalize international trade and investments - the main engines of economic growth and development. effective regional cooperation should also facilitate achieving sustainable development. as we pledged to leave no one behind in our collective journey, it is imperative to recognize that each country faces specific challenges in achieving the 2030 agenda, in particular, the most vulnerable countries such as the african countries, ldcs, lldcs and sids. therefore, we need to take into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development of those vulnerable countries and scale-up our assistance to them. with that in mind, we supported and welcomed the un secretary-general s un development system reform aimed at enhancing the un contribution to sustainable development. we believe that the new changes will transform the un system and will make it more capable of supporting the 2030 agenda and delivering better on the ground. madam president, 4 2018 was an important year not only for tajikistan, the country which actively advances the water agenda but to the entire water community across the globe. we witnessed a series of milestone events, starting in brazil with the 8th world water forum in brazil, then the launch of the water decade in new york, followed by the high-level international conference on international decade for action water for sustainable development, 2018-2028 in dushanbe, and culminating in new york with the hlpf 2018. each of the above events had a profound impact and made a significant contribution to the overall advancement of sdg 6 and other water-related goals of the 2030 agenda. for instance, the joint united nations and tajikistan high-level international conference on the water decade in dushanbe on june 20-22, 2018 brought together around 1500 people from 111 countries of the world. the conference also provided a timely and necessary platform for elaborating recommendations in the run-up to the hlpf where the sdg 6 had been reviewed. additionally, it helped among other things: - to increase attention to the water-related sdgs and targets at all levels, as well as to the interlinkages between different goals and targets; - strengthen cooperation and partnership at all levels to achieve water-related sdgs; - better understand how water contributes to achieving sustainability and how the lack of sustainability impacts water resources; - discuss the role of the dushanbe conferences for the implementation of the water for sustainable development decade; - moreover, most importantly, to discuss the importance of specific means of implementation, including monitoring, financing, capacity development, innovation, technology, knowledge, information, data, best practices, as well as promoting advocacy, networking and encouraging partnerships for action. encouraged by the success of the dushanbe conference and fulfilling the mandate of resolution 71/222, which declared the period of 2018-2028 as an international decade for action water for sustainable development , tajikistan is going to submit a draft proposal to the general assembly on the mid-term review of the implementation of the decade this fall. we sincerely hope that based on the success of the water decade resolution, which was co¬ sponsored in 2016 by the majority of member states the abovementioned draft resolution will enjoy your similar valuable support this time as well. thank you for your attention. 5","mahmadamin mahmadaminov (tajikistan) said today’s unprecedented global challenges threaten the very foundation of the world order and principles of international relations, as well as undermining efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals. the united nations must continue to coordinate the efforts of member states to enhance the resilience of countries to respond to modern challenges. full implementation of the 2030 agenda, addis ababa action agenda and paris agreement on climate change is required to address socioeconomic problems that are the main drivers of extremism and terrorism, he said. he went on to stress that efforts to eradicate terrorism should focus on the elimination of military infrastructure of international terrorism, depriving it of support, as well as the prevention of information and communications technology (ict) for radicalization, recruitment and propaganda. in may, tajikistan convened the “countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism” conference to discuss those issues. the united nations must also remain a critical platform for achieving consensus on the main issues of international security. he also called for a comprehensive settlement and post‑conflict rehabilitation in afghanistan targeted at economic recovery. his country is willing to take part in that process by connecting the transport arteries of the two countries with an “energy bridge” that provides the afghan population with essential commodities and training specialists. there are early signs that countries are not on track to reach the sustainable development goals, he said, urging that the means of implementation of those goals be strengthened, especially for developing countries. national development efforts also need to be supported by enabling international economic development with revitalized international trade and investments. regarding sustainable development goal 6, several events in 2017 had contributed to the advancement of the water agenda, including the joint united nations and tajikistan high‑level international conference on the water decade in dushanbe in june. following the success of that conference, tajikistan will submit a draft proposal to the general assembly on the mid‑term review of the implementation of the international decade for action “water for sustainable development”, this fall."
Thailand,"permanent mission of thailand to the united nations 351 east 52 nd street  new york, ny 10022 tel (212) 754-2230  fax (212) 688-3029 statement by h.e. mr. virasakdi futrakul deputy minister of foreign affairs of the kingdom of thailand at the general debate during the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly monday, 1 october 2018 united nations headquarters, new york as delivered -2- madam president, excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to represent the kingdom of thailand in this august assembly of the nations of the world. permit me at the outset to express our deepest condolences to the government and people of viet nam on the passing away of president tran dai quang. his dedication to viet nam and contributions to asean will always be remembered with respect. i also would like to express our heartfelt sympathy to and solidarity with the government and people of indonesia for the terrible loss of lives, injuries and damages following the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami that hit the island of sulawesi last week. and i join others in paying tribute to the memory of the late former secretary-general kofi annan. his efforts to streamline human rights into the work of all united nations organs has brought the united -3- nations closer to the people. he will be long remembered as the secretary-general who tried to make this world more humane. madam president, we are living in a vuca world characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. the united nations needs to adapt to meet the challenges of the vuca environment in order to fulfill its noble mission of peace and security, development, and human rights. thailand therefore supports efforts of the united nations secretarygeneral to reform the united nations system to make it more effective, efficient and human-centered. madam president, thailand has been active in translating the principles enshrined in the united nations charter into practices, to promote peace and security, to foster sustainable development, and to safeguard human rights. on peace and security, thailand supports efforts to make the security council more representative, more inclusive and more democratic. -4- we support the secretary-general’s commitment to forge stronger linkages between peace, security and sustainable development, as we believe that it is indeed the economic and social development of the communities, and of the people, that stands at the center of sustaining peace. since 1950, over 27,000 thai military and police personnel, men and women, have proudly served in more than 20 un peacekeeping and related missions. and we will do more. in addition to a number of military and police officers who are currently stationed at three peacekeeping missions, we are getting ready to deploy a horizontal military engineering company to join the un mission in south sudan (unmiss). wherever thai peacekeepers go, they simultaneously seek to keep peace and foster sustainable development or to engage in both peace-keeping and peace-building. thailand also supports a rules-based international order. last year, thailand became one of the first states to sign and ratify the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons (tpnw). and just last week, i deposited our instrument of ratification for the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (ctbt) which complements asean’s objective of making southeast asia a nuclear weapon free zone. -5- we also support efforts to achieve a peaceful and denuclearized korean peninsula. we also hope to see one day a nuclear-weapon free indopacific region. the late senator robert kennedy of new york once said, “some men see things as they are, and ask why. i dream of things that never were, and ask why not.” today all ten southeast asian nations have ratified the ctbt, why not all countries of the indopacific region. as an asian proverb states “a journey of a thousand of miles begins with the first step.” southeast asia has taken the first step towards a nuclear-weapon free region. why not the rest of the indopacific countries? on development, thailand supports the reform of the united nations development system to become more effective, efficient and peoplecentered. we are also reforming our whole country in implementing the sustainable development goals (sdgs). committing ourselves to realize the sdgs is one thing. implementing them locally is another. this is why the thai government strives to empower our local communities, in urban and rural areas, to change for the better – the way we produce and consume, the way we work and travel, the way we live – in order to achieve sustainability, in order to -6- realize the sdgs. as mahatma gandhi once said “we must be the change that we wish to see in the world.” sustainable development can only be achieved when it is inclusive and responds to the needs of people in the society. in thailand, we have launched our reforms based on what we have called the “pracha rat principle” or public-private-people partnership. under this principle, the people, the government and the private sector have worked closely together to pursue sustainable development. we have applied a holistic approach uniting all three sectors – public, private, and people – to ensure that all stakeholders are engaged in the country’s development efforts – leaving no one behind. in realizing sdg 14 – to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources – thailand is the first asian country to join a global initiative to clean up the oceans around tourist hotspots like koh samui, koh tao and the famous phuket. we are working on raising public awareness on climate change. we are also cooperating with other countries in the region to mitigate the risks of natural disasters like what just happened in indonesia. last year, in order to mitigate the manmade disaster of the pollution, in particular by plastic garbage to the seas and oceans, thailand hosted a meeting of ten southeast asian nations to -7- pool our efforts to clean the seas in our region. thailand also hosted a meeting of ten asean countries with china to map a strategy also to clean up our regional seas. we are mindful of the warning by the marine biologist rachel carson in her book “the sea around us,” “it is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. but the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself.” when we are seeking to save the seas and the oceans, we also seek to save the humankind. on human rights, we are finalizing the draft 4th national human rights plan for 2019 to 2023 to address a range of human rights challenges, including issues such as access to land and natural resources, the rights of lgbti persons, human rights defenders, and freedom of the press. we are also drafting a national action plan on business and human rights to make our private sector an indispensable partner in streamlining human rights into all sectors of the thai society. the thai government’s policies aim at addressing human rights challenges in a structural manner and laying the foundation for a sustainable democracy in thailand. to address discrimination and protect people in vulnerable situations, we have enacted the gender -8- equality act, the protection of vulnerable persons act, the justice fund act, and the equitable education fund act. a number of new laws are also in the pipeline such as the community forest bill to promote people’s participation in natural resource management, the bill on community banks, the land tax bill to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, and the prevention and elimination of forced labor bill to protect the rights of workers and to tackle trafficking in persons. thailand recently ratified the ilo’s protocol to convention 29 on forced labor as a part of our continued commitment to improve thai labor standards. the thai government firmly believes that engagement with the civil society is key to an inclusive approach to human rights and sustainable development. our relevant agencies have been holding periodic consultations with ngos working on sustainable development and human rights issues, including in our voluntary national review on the sdgs and in our national presentations to the human rights treaty bodies. -9- madam president, our continued commitment to the three pillars of the united nations – peace and security, development, and human rights – has contributed positively to the stability and prosperity of the kingdom of thailand. since the current government assumed office four years ago, thailand’s gdp has grown from 0.9 per cent in 2014 to 3.9 per cent last year. this year, our gdp is expected to grow between 4.4 and 4.9 per cent. national competitiveness has risen from the 37th place in 2014 to the 32nd place last year. tourists have returned, with over 35 million visitors last year. this year, the number of tourists coming to thailand is expected to be close to 40 million, thereby reflecting the tourists’ confidence in thailand’s peace and security. our efforts to realize the sdgs have also improved our people’s lives. maternal mortality ratio stands at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 live births. mortality rate of children under five is at 8.6 per 1,000 live births. people’s access to universal health care stands at 99.9 per cent. access to education at primary level is at 100 per cent, lower secondary school at 88.3 per cent and upper secondary school at 72.7 per cent. furthermore, sixty percent of our labor force are now women. - 10 - in our efforts to realize the sdgs, the royal thai government has been guided by his majesty the late king bhumibol adulyadej’s sufficiency economy philosophy or sep. the sep teaches us that development must be home-grown and rooted within each citizen in order to be sustainable. in other words, strength from within builds strength from without. the government has therefore focused its resources to empower households and communities through our policies in community banking, community land deeds, community forest, lifting household debts, and providing universal health coverage. thailand has also shared our philosophy of development, sep, with the group of 77 and china which endorsed it as one development model. we have also been working closely with over twenty countries around the world under the sep for sdgs partnership to share our sep developmental approach. madam president, looking ahead, the royal thai government is laying a strong foundation for stability and development through the 20-year national strategies in order to transform thailand into a strong and modern - 11 - economy ready to cope with the present day vuca environment and the challenges of the remainder of the twenty-first century. madam president, thailand was the birthplace of the association of southeast asian nations or asean. in 2019, thailand will become the chairman of asean. our goal during our chairmanship of asean is to foster the creation of a truly people-centered community, where no one is left behind. such a community would need to be resilient, dynamic, inclusive and forward-looking. during our chairmanship of asean, we will further strengthen our partnership with the united nations on the three noble missions of the united nations: peace and security, sustainable development and human rights. madam president, in our partnership with the united nations on sustainable development, we believe that ecosoc can help shape the directions and build policy - 12 - coherence to support the realizations of the sdgs. therefore, thailand seeks membership of ecosoc for the term 2020-2022. we will try our utmost to support ecosoc in advancing the 2030 agenda. i am also glad to announce that, to reaffirm our support for the repositioning of the united nations development system, thailand will contribute 200,000 us dollars to the special purpose trust fund to reinvigorate the resident coordinator system, in order to enhance the united nations’ work on the ground and to make the united nations more relevant to the people. madam president, as a small country, thailand takes to heart the statement by the late united nations secretary-general dag hammarskjöld that ultimately international law is the last defense of small countries. thailand views the united nations as an embodiment of international law in action. thailand therefore pledges our full and wholehearted cooperation with the united nations. i thank you, madam president. __________________","virasakdi futrakul, deputy minister for foreign affairs of thailand, voicing support to make the security council more representative, inclusive and democratic, also lauded the 27,000 thai military and police officers who have served in more than 20 peacekeeping and related missions. stressing that his country was one of the first states to ratify the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, he pointed out that all 10 southeast asian nations have now ratified the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. southeast asia has taken the first step towards a nuclear‑weapon free region, he said, adding: “why not the rest of the indo-pacific countries?” on a national platform, his government is committing to wide‑spread reforms towards implementing the sustainable development goals, he said, adding that local communities, in urban and rural areas, are being empowered to change for the better. such reforms are based on the public‑private‑people‑partnership principle whereby the three sectors are united and engaged. in realizing sustainable development goal 14, thailand is the first asian country to join a global initiative to clean up the oceans around tourist hotspots, he added, recalling that his country hosted a meeting of ten association of southeast asian nations (asean) countries with china to map a regional strategy as well. it is also working on raising public awareness on climate change and cooperating with countries in the region to mitigate the risks of natural disasters. in addition, thailand is finalizing its fourth national human rights plan for 2019 to 2023, with an aim to address a range of human rights challenges, including access to land and natural resources, rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, human rights defenders and freedom of the press. to that end, thailand will make the private sector an indispensable partner, as well as engage with civil society. other efforts include a number of new laws, including the land tax bill to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, and the prevention and elimination of forced labor bill to protect the rights of workers along with tackling trafficking in persons. also recently ratified was the international labor organization’s protocol to convention 29 on forced labor. “the government’s policies aim at addressing human rights challenges in a structural manner and laying the foundation for a sustainable democracy in thailand,” he said. thailand’s commitment to peace and security, development and human rights has contributed to its stability and prosperity, he underscored. in the past four years, its gross domestic product has grown from 0.9 to 3.9 per cent, national competitiveness has risen and tourists have returned to the country. the maternal mortality ratio, mortality rate of children and people’s access to universal health and education, as well as female employment have all improved. in 2019, as thailand becomes the chair of asean, it will strengthen the association’s partnership with the united nations and seek to foster the creation of a truly people‑centered community where no one is left behind. his country also seeks membership in the united nations economic and social council for 2020‑2022 to support the advancement of the 2030‑agenda, he added, pointing out that it will contribute $200,000 to the special purpose trust fund to reinvigorate the resident coordinator system."
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,"statement by the head of the delegation of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia 13""^ session of the united nations general assembly new york, 27*'' september 2018 republic of macedonia president speech by the president of the republic of macedonia, his excellency, dr. gjorge ivanov, delivered at the 73*^"" session of the united nations general assembly new york, 27 september 2018 distinguished madam president of the un general assembly, distinguished mr. secretary-general, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, this year, we are celebrating 100 years since the end of the first world war. the league of nations was supposed to safeguard peace. however, it failed. the united nations rose from the ashes of the second world war and were built over a world destroyed by fascism, nazism, racism and colonialism. by adopting the united nations charter, a brave generation of leaders gave hope to the unprivileged, the oppressed, the denied, that they will be able to exercise their right to self-determination. 70 years ago, the universal declaration of human rights became another gleam of hope for humanity. this hope became more realistic through the work of the united nations and its numerous programs. through peacekeeping missions, arms control, non-proliferation treaties and the fight against terrorism and international organized crime we build a safer world. the sustainable development goals help us focus our energy on reducing poverty, eradicating illnesses, spreading education, clean water and sanitation, and creating opportunities for the youth. with the paris agreement we fight climate change and try to build communities and nations resilient to disaster risks. as a result, millions of people today are living better lives then they did a decade ago. all these achievements would be unimaginable had we not united our efforts through the united nations. ladies and gentlemen, as president of the republic of macedonia, i can righteously say that the macedonian people participated in the creation of the post-world war ii order. we were at the right side of history, because even back in 1941, we started fighting the evil that was fascism and nazism. the macedonian state participated in the creation of the united nations. in 1945, the federative democratic yugoslavia was one of the founders of the united nations. as a constitutive republic with a right to self-determination to secession, macedonia was a co-founder of the united nations. as a state within that federation, we participated in the adoption of the universal declaration on human rights; in the international pacts on civil and political, economic, social and cultural rights that guarantee human dignity, the right to self-determination and the right to sovereign equality of states. on september 8, 1991, making use of our sovereign right to self-determination and secession, in a peaceful way, we left the collapsing federation and we proclaimed an independent and sovereign republic of macedonia. this is what the great injustice is all about. we were not allowed to enjoy the privileges of the organization and the documents in whose creation we once participated. we were denied the sovereign right to call ourselves by our name, as if an ordinary administrative region in greece (bearing the same name) has a bigger right in international relations than a sovereign state such as the republic of macedonia. 25 years ago, on april 8, 1993, the republic of macedonia became a member of the united nations. and yet, in this community of equals before the law, the republic of macedonia was admitted as less equal, with a derogated legal personality and a violated right to self-determination. today, 25 years later, the talks within the united nations should end by the adoption of the so-called prespa final agreement that according to some, should put an end to the name dispute with greece and open the way to membership of the republic of macedonia in the european union and nato. the settlement begins with a grand preamble whose formulations would make even the authors of the universal declaration quite envious. ironically, the prespa agreement violates the same universal principles and standards that it refers to in its preamble, including the right to human dignity. out of all the rights that have been violated, i wish to draw your attention to one - namely, the right to self-determination. the right of self-determination means that only the nation itself has the right to determine its destiny, that no one has the right forcibly to interfere in the life of the nation, to destroy its schools and other institutions, to violate its habits and customs, to repress its language, or curtail its rights. the right of self-determination means that a nation may arrange its life in the way it wishes. it has the right to arrange its life on the basis of autonomy. it has the right to complete secession. nations are sovereign, and all nations have equal rights. the right to self-determination is the source of the right of people to choose their own name and the name of the state they created. the right to choose a name is an inalienable part of the right to self-determination. only by respecting the right to selfdetermination will the united nations be relevant for all peoples. as a people, we have been bearing the name macedonians for centuries, and as a state for 74 years - even before the existence of the united nations. our attachment to this name was confirmed when, 27 years ago, we used our right to self-determination and proclaimed an independent and sovereign republic of macedonia. still, with the prespa agreement, greece is imposing a new name and is asking for an erga omnes implementation - both for international and domestic use. it is foreseen that we change our constitution, whereby greece would become the ultimate authority that would approve constitutional amendments. through this settlement, greece would be given a permanent monitoring over how we name ourselves, but also over how you. member states of the united nations, will address us. greece will be authorized to rename our institutions, to censor the contents of schoolbooks for our children, to prevent citizens from expressing their macedonian identity. this also regulates the appellation of our macedonian language. a very important part of our way of life will depend on greek will. it is a censorship of the world and an auto-censorship of the collective conscience of macedonian people. it is violence against our historical memory. there are hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and testimonies in the un archives, detailing what the greek state used to do to macedonians in greece. now, with the prespa agreement, the greek state wants to do the same to the macedonians in the republic of macedonia. the aim is to limit the use of the name macedonians to the smallest possible space - and that is the space between our two ears, all while keeping our mouth closed. it is a flagrant violation of the right to selfdetermination. however, this prespa agreement is just a bitter fruit of a tree that has been poisoned a long time ago. it is a detrimental compromise based on the 1995 interim accord. at a time when we were internationally isolated, the interim accord achieved under the auspices of the united nations was supposed to be a guarantee that greece would not block our integration in international organizations. however, there is a serious problem in this sense as well. no one can transfer to another more rights than they have themselves. and yet, with article 5 of the 1995 interim accord and under the un-led process, greece was allowed to negotiate with the republic of macedonia about its name. it is a violation of the right to self-determination. the interim accord itself is not without its own roots. it stems from resolutions 817 and 845 of the united nations security council in 1993. although it notes that the republic of macedonia fulfills the criteria for un membership contained in article 4 of the charter, the security council concludes nevertheless that there is a difference regarding the name of the state, conditioning the membership of the republic of macedonia with the acceptance of a provisional reference and an obligation to discuss about the name issue. that formulation is nothing else but a euphemism for violating the right to self determination. and thus we arrive at the root of the problem. the right to self-determination was violated when the republic of macedonia was admitted to the united nations. the interim accord and the prespa agreement have been adopted in order to justify that violation. you should know that the text of that socalled prespa agreement was prepared without my knowledge and without my consent as president of the republic of macedonia. moreover, the agreement violates a clause of our domestic law which is of fundamental importance. othena^ise said, the knot that started entangling with resolutions 817 and 845 and the interim accord, has now, with the prespa agreement, taken the shape of a hangman's noose. the republic of macedonia is now asked to commit a legal and historical suicide, so that the legal abolishment of macedonian people could then be interpreted as its own will. i wonder what this says about global leadership and shared responsibility of the united nations? ladies and gentlemen, greece insists on an erga omnes innplementation of the imposed name, thus making the violation of the right to self-determination erga omnes as well. however, the international court of justice has stated in its judgment of june 30, 1995 that the right to self-determination has indeed an erga omnes effect. this very important decision was neglected in the preparation of the interim accord, three months later. it is said that the macedonian case is a unique one in the united nations. however, the un archives have registered an almost identical case in which a member state denies the right of membership to an applicant country because of its name. i say almost, because the request of that member state to block the entry of the other country was ignored by the united nations. all of this happened after our precedent. i am asking: why is this not valid in the case of the republic of macedonia? are all states not equally sovereign? are the united nations more relevant for some, and less relevant for other peoples? again, we see an unprincipled athens victorious over a peace-loving melos, showing that the stronger do what they can, and the weaker do what they must. the prespa agreement places us in a fait accompli situation, in which we are told - you are smaller, you are weaker, and therefore you must accept athens' ultimatum. instead of being rewarded, we have been punished for our peace-loving nature. it seems to be forgotten that the united nations were created by visionaries who wanted an order in which even the smallest and the weakest of peoples would be protected. this because the respect of the rights of small peoples and states is a barometer for the observance of the international charter on human rights. aristotle claimed that whoever is not part of the polis is either a beast or a god. what the individual used to be to the ancient polis, is in a way, what the state is to the modern cosmopolis today. greece is acting as if it is not bound by the rules of international order. with this attitude, i wonder in which category would aristotle classify the cradle of democracy today. if the united nations are incapable of giving force to a righteous law, then they will only legitimate unrighteous force. and international order cannot be preserved by violating international law. for a long time, we were persuaded that there is no other way. but through the fruits, we recognized the tree. through this prespa agreement, we saw that we have been misled to search for a solution that would mean erosion of the right to selfdetermination. how should we undo this complicated know, this noose placed around our neck? the unraveling should begin where everything else began - with the violation of the right to self-determination. the vienna convention on treaties states very clearly that every agreement contrary to the ius cogens standards is null and void. according to article 1, item 2 and article 55 of the un charter, one of those ius cogens standards is the right to self-determination. article 5 of the 1995 interim accord specifies negotiations on the right to selfdetermination, which makes it contrary to this ius cogens standard. this, ladies and gentlemen, means that the entire 1995 interim accord is null and void, and with it, the prespa agreement that stems from it. no one has the right to bring into question the decision of the people to choose their name and the name of the country they created. it is a decision deriving from the right to self-determination established as an absolute right of all peoples. only the right to self-determination, and not its violation, can have an erga omnes effect. distinguished participants, as i am speaking here, in my country, the republic of macedonia, they are counting the last hours before the referendum on which my fellow citizens have been asked to express themselves on the prespa agreement. in these past few weeks, many high profile foreign representatives visited the republic of macedonia. i know that many of them sincerely wish to help the republic of macedonia become part of the european union and nato. and i thank them for their good intentions from the bottom of my heart. but i am afraid that they too have been misled. their message is that if the referendum fails and the prespa agreement is not accepted, then we should not hope for membership in nato and the european union. and i ask them - if you take away our hope, what will we be left with? help us by unblocking the process of eu and nato membership of the republic of macedonia without violating the right to self-determination in the process. many of them have been persuading macedonian citizens to accept the greek proposal. i ask them, would they accept a derogation of the right to self-determination of their own peoples and countries? would they accept interference in their internal affairs, a breach of sovereignty and political independence? why are then we asked to accept something that no one else in the world would accept? do not try to persuade us to eat from this poisoned fruit. poisonous tree and its poisonous fruit to be rooted out. it is high time for this therefore, in these last hours before the referendum silence, i wish to convey a message to my fellow citizens in the republic of macedonia. voting on a referendum is your right, and not an obligation. in accordance with article 7, item 3 of the referendum law, 'no one shall be held responsible for voting or not voting in a referendum'. every citizen has the right to decide how to act as regards this referendum - to go out and vote, or stay home and boycott. just as the referendum on september 8, 1991 led to sovereignty and independence, this referendum on september 30 may lead to a state of subordination and dependence towards another country. if this referendum succeeds in accordance with law, then not only will the name of the existing country be changed, but a new, semi-sovereign country will be created, with a new name and a new internal and international legal identity. we will be a state only by name, but not in substance, because others will regulate our way of life. however, if the referendum fails, a new possibility will arise. a possibility to discuss and explore new options for resolving the issue in accordance with international law, and by respecting our fundamental right to self-determination. to renew the national consensus that we achieved at the beginning of our independence. it does not take courage to capitulate. it takes courage to persist in the realization of the right to self-determination and preserve the sovereignty and independence of a country. it takes courage to tell the truth. this september 30th will be decisive for our future. but at the same time, for centuries in our tradition, september 30th has been the day when we celebrate faith, hope and love which arise from wisdom. do not lose the faith in yourselves, because the future of the republic of macedonia depends on you. do not lose the hope and patriotic love for the republic of macedonia, because only as a sovereign and independent country it can be a guardian of your freedom and human dignity. as a citizen, i have made my decision. on september 30th, i will not go out to vote. i believe that you, my fellow citizens, will make a wise decision. i also wish to address you, representatives of united nations member states. this irrational dispute has had detrimental consequences for the republic of macedonia and its citizens. due to greek blockades, we were denied the right to prosperity. unfortunately, all of this has reflected on the sustainability of the macedonian multiethnic, multireligious and multilingual society. a society which has actively contributed to peace, stability and security in the region and in europe for the past 27 years. the position of official athens is not only contrary to international law and the decision of macedonian citizens, it also goes against the will of almost 140 member states of the united nations which have recognized the fundamental right to self-determination of the republic of macedonia and use its constitutional name. as president of the republic of macedonia, i urge all states that already recognized the republic of macedonia and established diplomatic relations under its constitutional name, not to change their decisions. demonstrate your sovereignty by remaining faithful to your principled decisions, made without any kind of pressure. help us by being the guardians of our right to self-determination, thus safeguarding your right to self-determination. modern history has shown that the balkans are the birthplace of precedents. if we are turned into detrimental precedents that limit our sovereignty and political independence, then it is only a question of time when those will be applied in some of your states. what does this say about the relevance of united nations for all peoples, about leadership and shared responsibility? i have always been an advocate and an active contributor to the building of a true and lasting partnership between the republic of macedonia and greece, as well as friendship and trust between macedonian and greek societies. however, if the only way to accommodate the irrational demands of the greek side is through imposed measures on the macedonian side, what we get are relations without trust. this agreement does not bring macedonian and greek people together - it sets them apart. greek and macedonian society should learn how to live together in spite of their deepest differences. in order to reach a real, sustainable and lasting agreement, we need dialog instead of monolog, arguments instead of imposing by force, mutual respect instead of denial. only by supporting such a fair approach, the united nations will be relevant in our case, and will demonstrate leadership and shared responsibility. the united nations will only be relevant if they respect their own principles. dear friends, perhaps, even as i speak, there are statements being written condemning this speech. most often, the first reaction to truth is hatred. truth uncovers lies, it uncovers unfulfilled promises and guilty consciousness. and there is a lot of guilty consciousness involved in the macedonian case. however, truth also liberates and allows for the acceptance of guilt, for correction of mistakes and healing of the wounds from the violation of our fundamental right to self-determination and human dignity. and the simple truth is that we are macedonians and our country is the republic of macedonia. by respecting this simple truth for our identity, you respect our human dignity which is built in the foundations of freedom, justice and peace in the world. thank you. 8 statement by the head of the delegation of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia 73'^'' session of the united nations general assembly new york, 27*'' september 2018","gjorge ivanov, president of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia, recalled that “as a constitutive republic with a right of self-determination to secession, macedonia was a co-founder of the united nations”. although his country became a member of the united nations in 1993, it was denied the sovereign right to call itself by its name. according to some, the adoption of the prespa agreement will put an end to the name dispute with greece and open a way to membership of his country in the european union and the north atlantic treaty organization (nato). yet, this agreement violates the universal principles and standards outlined in its preamble, notably the right to self-determination, he stated. greece seeks to impose a new name, asking for an erga omnes implementation, he continued, adding that “the aim is to limit the use of the name ‘macedonians’ to the smallest possible space — and that is the space between our two ears — all while keeping our mouths closed”. he described the prespa agreement as a detrimental compromise, likening it to “a bitter fruit of a tree that has been poisoned a long time ago”. security council resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993) — which conditioned his country’s membership on the acceptance of a provisional reference and an obligation to discuss the name issue — violated the right to self‑determination. both the 1995 interim accord and the prespa agreement were adopted to justify this violation. stressing that greece is acting as if it were not bound by the rules of international order, he said that, as per the vienna convention, the 1995 interim accord and the prespa agreement that stem from it are null and void because they violate the jus cogens standard of self-determination. he underscored that this standard is established by article 1, item 2 and article 55 of the united nations charter. “if the united nations are incapable of giving force to a righteous law, then they will only legitimate unrighteous force,” he stated. a referendum on the prespa agreement will take place in his country on 30 september, he said, thanking the foreign representatives who visited his country recently for their good intentions. however, he called on them to unblock the european union and nato membership process without violating the right to self-determination. reminding his fellow citizens that voting on a referendum is a right, not an obligation, he warned that if the referendum succeeds a semi-sovereign state will be created. if it fails, a possibility to “renew the national consensus that we achieved at the beginning of our independence” will arise. he himself will not vote, he added. emphasizing that this irrational dispute has had detrimental consequences for his country and its citizens, he said that his country was denied the right to prosperity due to greek blockades. he called on all the states that have already recognized his country and established diplomatic relations under its constitutional name not to reverse their decision. “help us by being the guardians of our right to self-determination, thus safeguarding your right to self-determination,” he said, stressing that the united nations can only be relevant if it respects its own principles."
Timor-Leste,"to be delivered by h.e. ms. maria helena opes de jesus pires mbassador and permanent represe tative on behalf of h.e. mr. dionisio babo soares mi ister for foreign ffairs a d cooperation of the democratic republic of timor-leste at the seventy third session of the united nations gener l assembly mo day, 1 october 2018 general asse bly h ll united n tions, new york check against deliver excellency, mrs. maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the general assembly your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen i have the honor to address the 73rd united nations general assembly on behalf of his excellency dionfsio babo soares, minister of foreign affairs and cooperation of timor-leste. first of all, allow me to join our voices to the previous speakers and to present on behalf of timor-leste, our deepest condolences to the people of indonesia, particularly to the families of the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in palu, sulawesi. i would like to start by congratulating her excellency mrs. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her election as president of the general assembly, and also wish her the best success in this session under the them: ""making the united nations relevant 2 for all people: global leadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies."" taking in to account that this is only the fourth time in the history of this organization that a woman leads this important body, i believe that the president will also be an important role model for women and girls worldwide. madam president, i would like to assure you that you can count on timor-leste's support. i would also like to extend our gratitude to his excellency mr. miroslav lajcak for all his work towards sustainin peace and preventin conflict. timor-leste also com ends the manner in which election of the 70th president of the general assembly, took place under the leadership of president lajcak, which provided an excellent precedent for future elections. madam president distinguished delegates 3 we appreciate the theme chosen for this session, and we believe that it is most appropriate. this theme draws our attention to the need to unite peoples at a time when we are witnessing a gradual, but unquestionable, breakdown of the world order, increasing even more the inequality and insecurity, further undermining faith in national and international institutions. at a juncture when the solidarity amongst peoples, assumes extreme importance in the global agenda, feeling of helplessness and impotence can be seen which that divides people and provokes hostility. that is why the theme of this session is so important and appropriate, because of the focus is on inclusiveness, equality and global leadership. timor-leste is undoubtedly the leading example of the importance of an order based on international law. next year, our nation celebrates the 20th anniversary of the popular consultation organized by the united nations, in which our people voted courageously for the independence. 4 we can not forget nor fail to pay tribute to the then secretary general our dear friend kofi annan. it was with deep sorrow and sadness that our people received the news of his eath. as secretary general of the united nations, kofi annan played a leading role in conducting the negotiations between portugal and indonesia, which culminated in the signing of the agreement of 5 may 1999, giving rise to popular consultation in timor-leste. this is a significant milestone that we will also be comemorated next year. recently, the united nations played again a major role in timor-leste's future. for the first time, a conciliation commission, established in 2016 under the united nations convention on the law of the sea, succeeded in the positive resolution of a longstanding dispute between timor-leste and australia about the definition of maritime boundaries. 5 a process that take about a year and a half, and culminated in a new maritime boundary treaty, signed in this building on march 6 of this year, with the presence of his excellency the secretary-general of the united nations, antonio guterres. this new treaty allowed us to consolidate national sovereignty and establish an important model for the peaceful resolution of international disputes. in a time of increasing global geopolitical tensions over maritime disputes, the success of the first conciliation process in history assume an unprecedented international significance. timor-leste encourages other state members to consider this mechanism for the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes. we believe that this mechanism will play an important role in appeasing global tensions on our seas. madam president, ladies and gentlemen 6 our world faces many challenges which can be effectively resolved through dialog, cooperation and based on international law. one of the main challenges of our times is without doubt climate change. this is an issue that secretary-general antonio guterres has defined as ""the determinant issue of our time."" timor-leste is confident that the international community will act uniformly to respond to this existential threat to our planet. i take this opportunity to highlight the importance of an active and extensive cooperation to pursuit an urgent and real action that exists among small island developing states, including those in the pacific region, who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of the climate changes. madam president ladies and gentlemen i also would like to emphasis a fundamental issue, which also requires all the attention of the international community, and that is global migration. 7 conflicts, wars, situations of inequality and climate change result in an intense migratory movement throughout the world. timor-leste commends the united nations for the global pact on migration, promoting international cooperation in order to reap the benefits of migration and to address the risks and challenges faced by many migrants. madam president, ladies and gentleman unfortunately, many fragile states remain isolated and subject to political and economic forces beyond their control. our experience shows us that war and social conflict block the sustainable development of nations. timor-leste and the g7 + countries know from experience that sustainable development cannot be achieved without peace. that is why we are aware that the 8 remaining 17 sustainable development goals will be unattainable if we are not able to combat fragility and building peaceful just and inclusive societies. we expect that the assessment of the 2030 agenda, which will take place in 2019, can bring these concerns to the international agenda and that fragile and vulnerable countries will not be left behind. v'l madam president, ladies and gentleman timor-leste welcomes the reforms of the united nations system under the leadership of the secretary general antonio guterres. following the implementation of the plan to enhance the role of the united nations resident coordinator, timor-leste will contribute a modest amount over the next 5 years. we also support the reforms, without reservations, under the peace and security pillar. we commend the secretary-general for his initiative on action for peace including the declaration of shared commitments on un peacekeeping operations, which timor-leste has signed. 9 in order to contribute to peace operations, timor-leste is currently investing in the preparation of its police and military personnel, to increase their capacity and the possibility to contribute in the near future to the united nations missions. however, despite our shared efforts, we continue to see conflicts and war in the world that fill us with concern. the continuing war in syria is a tragedy that has been causing irreparable human damage and terrible suffering for the people living in that region. timor-leste urges that the international community develops all efforts to put an end to this war and to end the deaths and the destruction of this country. the people of western sahara are still denied their right to self-determination. we welcome the appointment of the secretary-general's personal envoy, mr. horst kohler, and we appeal to the kingdom of morocco and the polisario front to seriously dialog in order to find a mutually benefic political solution to enable the people of western sahara to exercise their right to self-determination through a referendum organized by the united nations. 10 timor-leste encourages the international community to redouble its efforts to finding with the concerned parties, a just, peaceful and lasting solution to the question of palestine. we reaffirm timor-leste's support for the two-state solution and the urgent protection of the civilian population. timor-leste also remains concerned about the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed to the republic of cuba, over the last six decades, which has a considerable impact on the lives of the people and the development of the country. in our region, we felt encouraged by the continued dialog for peace and reconciliation on the korean peninsula, and we hope that the dialog between the parties will bring an end to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. excellency mrs. president madam president ladies and gentleman 11 allow me to take this opportunity to tal about the situation in timor-leste. on may 12 of this year, we held early legislative elections. the elections were held in a peaceful environment, and resulted in a new excutive led by h.e. taur matan ruak. after a period of economic stagnation due to the political crisis, the country is resuming its development and economic growth, towards normality. the socio¬ economic foundations that we need to create for a prosperous and united society were already established. with the recent promulgation of the state budget, we can continue to improve our social, housing and communications infrastructure and thus develop opportunities for investment and economic development. another important step for timor-leste was the government's decision to acquire 30% of the capital in the consortium that operates the greater sunrise field and thus opening the possibility of bringing the pipeline to timorese territory and the accelerated development of the south coast. our historic leader, and former president of the republic and prime minister, his excellency xanana gusmao once again, successfully conducted the negotiations. 12 we continue to have strong relations with our neighbors - indonesia and australia, and we deepen our cooperation with the asean countries and await serenely for decision about our request to accede to this organization. timor-leste remains committed to strength ties of friendship and cooperation with the countries of the community of portuguese-speaking countries, and hopes that the portuguese language, spoken by about 250 million people worldwide, will also be an official language of the united nations. our country has also signed the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons and we encourage all state members to do so. madam president ladies and gentleman we live in a world that is different from the post second world war, when the united nations was created. the current times are full of challenges and more than 13 ever, all of us need to be prepared to meet the challenges, the wishes and aspirations, stressing increasingly the value of multilateralism. timor-leste firmly believes in the united nations and in the international system. as such, we are committed to work cooperatively for the international peace, security and prosperity, for the well-being of humanity. than you very much. 14","maria helena lopes de jesus pires (timor‑leste) noted that one of today’s main challenges is climate change and stressed the importance of active cooperation to combat it among small island developing states, which are particularly vulnerable. the international community must also focus its attention on global migration, which has intensified due to conflicts, wars, inequality and climate change. many fragile states remain isolated and subject to political and economic forces beyond their control, she added, blocking their efforts to attain sustainable development. the 17 sustainable development goals will not be reached unless the international community combats fragility and assists in building peaceful, just and inclusive societies. assessment of the 2030 agenda, which will take place in 2019, should bring those concerns to the global agenda. she welcomed united nations reforms under the current leadership, but expressed concern over continuing conflicts around the world. describing the war in syria as a tragedy that has caused irreparable human damage and terrible suffering for people in the region, she urged the international community to end death and destruction in the country. she also encouraged the global community to redouble its efforts to find a just, peaceful and lasting solution for palestine. on a more positive note, continued dialog between parties on the korean peninsula is encouraging and will hopefully bring an end to proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region."
Togo,,"robert dussey, minister for foreign affairs of togo, called for expanding the legitimacy and reach of the united nations. “we must shoulder the new responsibilities that have emerged,” he emphasized. the time has come to invent a new paradigm. he reiterated togo’s full support to the reform plans of the organization as proposed by secretary-general antónio guterres. reform on the peace and security pillar of the organization will make it more effective. peace and security must go hand-in-hand with promoting human rights. turning to the 2030 agenda, he called on the united nations to help developing countries take that “extra step forward”. the system must be repositioned towards enhanced accountability. on climate change, he expressed support for the paris agreement. an effective response to climate change is essential for the achievement of sustainable development. the united nations can do more to invest in people which will in turn promote development and peace in the world. the challenges facing africa are huge, as the continent is confronting with new forces. poverty is still too present in africa, he said, adding: “the people are still awaiting a better day.” african youth and migrants require a sustainable response. the emergence of peaceful, equitable, prosperous and sustaining societies cannot happen if we do not have mutually advantageous partnerships. the united nations could do more to coordinate its actions on subregional and regionals organizations. touching on africa’s agenda 2063, he outlined the many ongoing initiatives focused on integration. “we must redouble efforts to put an end to conflicts, especially in africa,” he continued, noting united nations peacekeeping activities on his continent. he welcomed a shared vision of responsibility, which would allow all member states of the united nations to take charge and action. togo’s national plan aligns with the 2030 agenda with the government aiming to turn the country into a middle-income country. togo strives to improve the standard of living of its citizens and reduce pockets of poverty."
Tonga,"stateme t of his majesty king tupou vi sovereign and head of state of the kingdom of tonga on the occasion of the general debate at the seventy-third session of the united nations general assembly wednesday, 26th september 2018 united nations headquarters, new york madam president, i congratulate you on the assumption of your presidency of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. i assure you that the tonga delegation will fully support your able leadership. i express our gratitude to your predecessor, his e cellency mr. miroslav lajcak, for his successful and able leadership of the assembly at its 72nd session, in particular making the work of the assembly be people-centered, by striving for peace and a decent life for all, on a sustainable planet. i also commend his excellency mr. antonio guterres for the ongoing stewardship of the secretariat. tonga fully supports the ongoing work he is undertaking on reform, including the all-important review of the united nations multi-country offices in the pacific islands region. madam president, my delegation and i congratulate you also on your theme as being both timely and relevant. making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies aptly reflects who we are as a collective, ensuring the work of the united nations has meaning to those that matter most our peoples - and we welcome your theme as the guiding principle for our work this session. madam president, in contributing towards the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and its sustainable development goals (sdgs), including the internationally agreed blueprint for the sustainable development of small island developing states (sids), the samoa pathway, tonga has made both agreements an integral part of its national planning processes. the government s priority agenda from year 2018 to 2021 aligns with 13 of the 17 sdgs namely goals, 1 to 4, 6 to 9, and 13 to 17. madam president, the high-level political forum (hlpf) remains an important means which tonga endorses, for the follow-up, monitoring, and accountability of commitment by member states through voluntary national reviews which are linked to the 2030 agenda and the addis ababa action agenda. tonga looks forward to presenting its first voluntary national report (vnr) report to the hlpf in 2019. the hlpf will also dedicate a day at its high-level ministerial segment to the mid-term review of the samoa pathway in 2019. tonga was pleased to host the pacific regional preparatory meeting for the mid-term review of the samoa pathway in june this year of which its outcome report forms the latest iteration of the pacific s sustainable development aspirations. tonga looks forward to engaging with other sids and partners in samoa at the end of next month to produce the final inter-regional report for the midterm review of the samoa pathway for consideration at the hlpf next year. 2 we recognize the important contribution of the united nations office of the high representative for least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing states, the united nations department for economic and social affairs and the united nations escap pacific office in this regard. madam president, tonga welcomes the convening of the 3rd high-level meeting on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases tomorrow. combatting the threat ncds presents to individuals, fa ilie and communities, has been recognized as being grossly underfunded given its magnitude. in tonga, we are pleased to inform of commendable reductions in the prevalence of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. tongan people are eating healthier food and involved more in physical activities. we are, however, not without challenges as evidenced, for example, in the rising obesity rates. the tongan government is addressing the issue by making unhealthy food choices more expensive and healthier food choices cheaper for the tongan public. madam president, climate change continues to pose significant security threats to us as island states. pacific leaders in nauru earlier this month endorsed an expanded concept of security in their communique and the boe declaration linking, inter alia, climate change and threats to international peace and security. in this regard, tonga welcomes the establishment of the group of friends on climate and security to further highlight the nexus between the threats of climate change with threats to international peace and security. we note with concern the devastating impacts of climate change on our marine environment. baselines that determine our territorial boundaries, once established under the un convention of the law of the sea, should not be affected and should remain unchanged despite the effects of sea level rise. our sovereignty must not be compromised by climate change and we welcome the work of the international law commission on this critically important and timely issue for consideration of the sixth committee of the general assembly. tonga looks forward to taking our important work forward at the 24th session of the un framework convention on climate change, and strongly addressing the adverse impacts of climate change, and urgent need for innovation in adaptation for sids under the leadership of poland in december. madam presi ent tonga has engaged in this year s first intergovernmental conference on the conservation and sustainable use of the biological diversity in the high seas and the seabed and we are hopeful that a gradual convergence of views will result in a zero draft of a legally binding in trument for consideration at the second and third meetings of the inter-governmental conference in march and august next year. tonga has also continued its engagement at the international seabed authority ensuring the appropriate management of the resources of the area. tonga is grateful to the members of the authority for its re-election this year to the council and we look forward to working together in the development of the important draft exploitation regulations. tonga also looks forward to hosting the first regional international seabed authority workshop in early 2019, to explore the benefits of seabed mining to the blue economy of pacific islands and to progressing the development of a regional treaty on deep sea mining we would like to acknowledge italy s ongoing partnership with tonga through the joint committee in strengthening tonga s capacity in the field of the environment and ocean. we also acknowledge the work of the secretariat of the pacific community, the commonwealth secretariat, and the pew charitable trust on the regional treaty. madam president tonga commissioned its first independent power producer-owned solar fa m last year and strongly believes that it can achieve its 50% by 2020 renewable energy target through more and stronger public-private partnership arrangements. tonga wishes to acknowledge the partnership it has established with the government of austria, the united nations industrial development organization, and the pacific community, to establish the pacific center for renewable energy and energy efficiency - a specialized regional entity to support private sector investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency in the pacific islands. we would also like to recognize and acknowledge the announcement made by the government of norway of its commitment to provide us dollar 2 million in support of the important work of the center. madam president, finally, sustainable development, whether it be, inter alia, through good health and well¬ being, climate action, life below water, or affordable and clean energy, can only be realized through international peace and security. we continue to look to the security council to protect the innocent from threats to international peace and security in whatever form, be they traditional threats such as armed conflict, or newer threats like climate change, to ensure no one is left behind. may almighty god guide and bless you, and all the member states of the united nations, their respective governments, and our peoples. thank you

Trinidad and Tobago,"trinidad and tobago permanent mission of the republic of trinidad and tobago to the united nations 633 third avenue, 12th floor0 new york, n.y. 10017 ® tel.: (212) 697-7620 ® fax: (212) 682-3580 ' statement by senator the honorable dennis moses, minister of foreign and caricom affairs of the republic of tri idad and tobago during the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly 29 september 2018 general assembly hall united nations headquarters madam preside t, i am honored to address this eminent congress of nations seized with advancing the international agenda towards the realization of international peace, sustainable development and the well-being of all humankind. on beh lf of the governme t an people of the re ublic of trinidad nd tob go, i extend congr tulations to you on your election as presi ent of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. as we continue to pursue gender equality across all borders and spheres of endeavor, your assumption to the seat of the presidency of the general assembly is further impetus for global rethinking and acceptance of female leadership, and toward strengthening the global pursuit of gender parity, empowerment and equality. allow me to express, further, the gratitude of the delegation of trinidad and tobago to your predecessor, his excellency miroslav lajcak, whose leadership helped advance the efforts of the united nations to undertake an ambitious task of system-wide reform. the reform agenda marks a new and emerging approach to multilateral institutionalism and presents an opportunity to transform the united nations into a dynamic body capable of better responding to the needs and challenges reflecting the diversity of its membership. madam presi ent, this year s theme, making the united nations relevant to all people: global leader hip and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies , compels us to reflect on the nexus between the un’s ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda and our shared pursuit of a sustainable future for all. the myriad multidimensional threats that litter the international development landscape threaten our efforts to ard universal sustainable development, the eradication of extreme poverty, peace and security and the enjoyment of fundamental human rights by all. the existential threat posed by unmitigated climate change and global temperature increase, the undeniable challenge of extreme poverty, violent extremism, gender-based violence, and the spread of new and infectious diseases is one that is best faced together, as member states of the united nations. as the bastion of international peace and security, human rights, sustainable development and the rule of law, the united nations, as an institution, is compelled to adopt a shift in its approach to ensure adequate, effective and efficient responses to the challenges of our time. it is on this basis that the government of trinidad and tobago reaffirms its support for the implementation of the secretary-general’s reform agenda, in accordance with the relevant general assembly resolutions. as we pursue the cost-savings and efficiencies associated with the reform agenda, however, it is imperative that we do not lose sight of the foundational principles, values and overarching objectives of this august institution. in this regard, i am reminded of the words of former un secretary-general, the late kofi annan. he reminded us that, even though the united nations is an organization of states, the charter is written in the name of we the peoplesp ultimately, this is the role of the united nations: to serve the needs and hopes of people everywhere. peo le must be at the ce tre of our common endeavor. 1 having recognized this infinite truth, madam presi e t, t e government of trinidad and tobago, through wide consultation, developed a na ional development strategy, titled vision 2030 . this multidimensional and inclusive development policy places our people, our greatest resource, at the center of our pursuit of the sustainable development goals. if we are to truly ensure no one is left behind, it is imperative that we advance our efforts to ensure equitable access to opportunity and mobility for the most vulnerable. those who have long been left behind must now be positioned to participate in society as equals. by its very nature, the scope of the 2030 agenda speaks to the wide range of issues that challenge global sustainable development. notwithstanding the global relevance of these challenges, it is widely acknowledged that asymmetries exist with regard to the impact of external shocks on small island developing states (sids), such as trinidad and tobago and the caribbean region. the government of trinidad and tobago recognizes the samoa pathway as an essential component in the catalog of development frameworks to specifically guide in the sustainable development of sids. accordingly, trinidad and tobago welcomes the san pedro declaration adopted at the caribbean regional preparatory meeting of sids in belize, and looks forward to participating in the high level review summit of the samoa pathway in 2019. moreover, trinidad and tobago takes this opportunity to reinforce the principle that sids continue to be a special case for sustainable development, given our complex and intricate challenges. as we and our regional partners prioritize the unique threats to the development of our people, the 2030 agenda provides an important guide in our efforts to ensure that none of our citizens are left behind. in manifesting the intent of the agenda, we have come to appreciate the importance of prioritizing the wellbeing of all of our citizens. in this rega d, trinidad and tobago and our caricom counterparts are taking action to ddress the threat that high incidences of non-communicable diseases (ncds) poses to our region. these diseases ravage our hu an resources, burden our healthcare systems and undermine our development efforts. since the adoption of the port of spain declaration on ncds by caricom heads of government in 2007, and the landmark united nations high-level meeting on the prevention and control of ncds in 2011, trinidad and tobago has implemented a number of strategies for controlling and reducing ncds. our national strategic plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases 2017- 2021 aims to harness the collective efforts of both the public and private sector in respect ofncd prevention and control. in this regard, the government of trinidad and tobago welcomes the adoption of the political declaration of the third high-level meeting on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. we remain fully committed to addressing ncds and to ensuring that it remains on the international agenda. by raising the standard of living, improving the educational and healthcare systems, and providing equal access to opportunities, trinidad and tobago s vision 2030 is actively pursuing the development of a resilient, equitable and healthy society that places all people at the nucleus of our sustainable development efforts. 2 however, m dam president, no challenge is more pressing than that of climate change. for small island developing states (sids) like trinidad and tobago, casting doubt on the scientific truth behind climate change only serves to distract and to delay the urgent and ambitious action that is needed to confront the existential threat posed by global temperature increase. earlier this year, the government of trinidad and tobago deposited its instrument of ratification to the paris agreement, thus formalizing its steadfast commitment to the principles and goals of the agreement. as our national contribution to achieving the overarching objective of the paris agreement, trinidad and tobago has committed to reducing cumulative greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent from industry, power generation and the transport sector by the year 2030. as a state party, trinidad and tobago will be actively engaged in the negotiating process under the unfccc to operationalise the paris agreement on a scale that will result in achieving the long-term temperature goal, and further limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees celsius. it is also hoped that the operationalisation process will catalyze international cooperation on mitigation, adaptation and climate finance, to this end. madam preside t, our commitment to the paris agreement reflects trinidad and tobago s overall responsibility to support inte ational efforts to tackle shared environmental challenges, which include climate change, ozone depletion, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, illegal trade of wildlife and the movement of hazardous wastes. as a twin-island state, the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources is critically important to the development priorities of trinidad and tobago. however, trinidad and tobago is located in a region that is highly vulnerable to an unprecedented rate ofloss of marine biodiversity and the impacts of unsustainable practices on the marine environment. therefore, we welcome the first session of the intergovernmental conference to develop a legally binding instrument under the united nations convention on the law of the sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. the government of trinidad and tobago looks forward to participating in the future sessions of the intergovernmental conference in 2019 and 2020 to elaborate the text of the instrument, which will ensure the protection and sustainable management of the common heritage of mankind for the benefit of present and future generations. madam president, one of the pressing challenges facing the region is the cessation of correspondent banking relations, and the labeling of countries in the caricom region as non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. this issue has severely destabilized the financial sectors of the region without due consideration to the financial, human and technical constraints confronting our member states. as a result, the region’s efforts to bolster our economic stability and effectively engage in the global financial system effectively have been stymied to the detriment of our economic growth and progress. this has the potential to further erode the development gains achieved thus far. in this regard, trinidad and tobago joins with other caricom member states in reiterating our commitment to ensuring compliance with globally accepted standards and calls on our international partners to engage constructively on this issue. 3 madam president, in our collective journey towards sustainable development, the government of trinidad and tobago is fully convinced that the united nations development system, for the foreseeable future, will remain a reliable partner to assist our country in its efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals, and our vision 2030 national development strategy. with this in mind, the government of trinidad and tobago welcomes the secretary-general s efforts to reposition the un development system to better support the implementation of the 2030 agenda and the samoa pathway, including through the reinvigorated resident coordinator system. trinidad and tobago reiterates the importance of ensuring that the development system adopts a more responsive and flexible approach to its development assistance, based on national priorities and needs, while strengthening national ownership and leadership. madam president, the united nations has long recognized the interconnectedness between peace and development: a symbiotic relationship, where one cannot exist without the other. ongoing conflicts across the world serve as stark reminders of the need to promote a positive, dynamic and participatory international peace and security architecture, that is hinged on the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation between governments, international organizations, and civil society, and that is in compliance with international obligations under the charter of the united nations and international law. the illegal trade in arms continues to affect the social and economic fabric of the caribbean region, including trinidad and tobago. this is a particularly applicable to the trade in small arms and light weapons, which is linked to other transnational organized crime, such as drug trafficking. it threatens the livelihood of our people, undermines the rule of law and challenges our efforts for a peaceful, equitable and sustainable country. on the global level, trinidad and tobago fully subscribes to the object and purpose of the arms trade treaty, which can be leveraged as a mechanism for reducing incidences of armed violence in the region. thus, since 2010, trinidad and tobago has tabled the biennial resolution on women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, which encourages women s participation in disarmament decision-making processes. on the issue of denuclearization, trinidad and tobago holds the firm view that the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons constitutes a crime against humanity, and a violation of international law, including the principles of the charter of the united nations. therefore, the government of trinidad and tobago remains robust in its support for the full and effective implementation of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons and is actively treating with the issue of signature and ratification. 4 madam presi ent, trinidad and tobago has long recognized that international peace and security must be supported by a robust international legal system, including in respect of international criminal justice. trinidad and tobago, through the work of our former prime minister and president of trinidad and tobago, the late arthur n.r. robinson, was at the vanguard of efforts towards the establishment of the international criminal court two decades ago. trinidad and tobago remains a fervent advocate of the court, underscoring its importance and legitimacy in various fora. we stand resolute in our commitment to support the mandate of the icc and promote the universality of the rome statue. the delegation of trinidad and tobago wishes to make the point that, consistent with the principle of complementarity enshrined in the rome statute, the court s jurisdiction is only invoked when states are unable or unwilling to prosecute those accused of committing the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. in fact, the late kofi annan stated at the adoption of the rome statute that, and i quote: gradually the world has come to realize that relying on each state or army to punish its own transgressors is not enough. when crimes are committed on such a scale we know that the state lacks either the power or the will to stop them. therefore, no individual or state that demonstrates full respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights should fear the icc. those who fail to cooperate with the court are contributing to a culture of impunity that undermines the rule of law, but also denies justice to victims of heinous crimes. madam president, our best efforts to strengthen multilateral peace and security will surely fall short unless there is real and significant reform of the security council. while we welcome the continuation of the inter-governmental negotiations on security council reform, trinidad and tobago remains concerned that such discussions have not resulted in tangible progress towards a text-based negotiation. trinidad and tobago urges the international community to work collaboratively towards reforming the security council to better address current realities and challenges, including those faced by small island developing states, as well as to improve the effectiveness and credibility of the united nations for the maintenance of peace and international security. madam president, this year, the world has witnessed the unifying power of dialog and understanding with the recent panmunjom declaration for peace, prosperity and the unification of the korean peninsula between the republic of korea and the democratic people’s republic of korea. trinidad and tobago remains optimistic that this historic milestone will usher in a new era of peace, cooperation and the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula. 5 i> despite this positive development, in our own region, the economic, commercial and financial embargo against cuba continues to stand as the last vestige of the cold war. in keeping with its commitment to the charter of the united nations, and the 2030 sustainable development agenda, which calls for no one to be left behind, the government of trinidad and tobago reaffirms its unceasing call for the cessation of the economic, commercial financial embargo against cuba, sooner rather than later. ma am preside t, at the heart of our sovereign nations, our cultures and our languages, lies an individual being, who, at the very core, seeks a life of purpose, happiness and the opportunity to live in peace and prosperity. the challenge of our time is to pursue and achieve a sustainable future for all in the face of burgeoning threats to our shared humanity, including but not limited to the threats posed by extreme poverty, rising inequality, climate change and protracted conflicts. facing that challenge requires deepened partnerships, meaningful dialog, and an appropriate review of established mechanisms and institutions that, if reformed, can exponentially improve our ability to transform lives globally. the gover me t of trini ad an toba o remains unequivocally committed to the purposes n rinciples of the charter of the united n tions and to the achievement of the objectives of the 2030 agend for sust inable develo ment. we commit to continuing to work in good faith with this august body that has long stood as the cornerstone of multilateralism, in the face of unprecedented ch llenges and threats facing humanity, to ensure no one is left behind. i thank you, madam president. 6","denis moses, minister for foreign affairs of trinidad and tobago, said maría fernanda espinosa garcés’ presidency of the general assembly is an impetus for global rethinking and acceptance of female leadership. further, this year’s assembly debate compels states to reflect on the nexus between the united nations reform agenda and the shared pursuit of a sustainable future. with the push towards cost-saving reform, the organization must not lose sight of its foundational principles. recognizing the need to serve all people, his country developed the “vision 2030” national development strategy, as it is imperative to ensure equal opportunities are available to the most vulnerable members of society. small island developing states are disproportionately affected by external shocks, he underscored, adding that the samoa pathway is an essential component in the development frameworks of those states. as part of efforts to achieve the goals of the 2030 agenda, regional partners are taking action to address the threat of non-communicable diseases. climate change is the most pressing challenge of the time and casting doubt on its scientific truth delays urgent action needed to confront the existential threat. his government is formalizing its commitment to the paris agreement, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent by the year 2030 and supporting international efforts to tackle shared environmental challenges. the labeling of the caribbean community (caricom) countries as “non-cooperative tax jurisdictions” severely destabilizes the region’s financial sector, he warned, noting that the label stymies the region’s engagement in the global financial system. the united nations recognizes the link between peace and development and persistent conflicts around the world are reminders of the need to promote a positive, dynamic and participatory international peace and security architecture. illicit arms trading and transnational organized crime affect the social and economic fabric of the caribbean, he said, noting his country’s subscription to the object and purpose of the arms trade treaty. international peace and security must be supported by a robust international legal system and trinidad and tobago remains a fervent supporter of the international criminal court, he said. the court’s jurisdiction is only invoked when states are unable or unwilling to prosecute those accused of the most serious crimes. efforts to strengthen multilateral peace and security will fall short unless there is real and significant reform of the security council so that body is able to address the challenges faced by small island developing states. the unifying power of dialog is on full display in the korean peninsula, he said, while voicing concern over the ongoing embargo against cuba. more so, facing global challenges calls for deep partnerships, meaningful dialog and an appropriate view of established mechanisms and institutions, he stressed."
Tunisia,,"khemaies jhinaoui, minister for foreign affairs of tunisia, voiced support for efforts to render the united nations better able to confront modern‑day challenges, build peace and security, and promote sustainable development. those issues are a common responsibility of all people, he stressed, spotlighting the need to address conflict hotspots, bridge inequality and shore up efforts to combat terrorism and organized crime. promoting human rights is also critical, he said, voicing support for the secretary‑general’s major reform proposals in management, peace and security, and development – as well as for financial support to those reforms by all nations and the strengthening of the general assembly’s role. tunisia continues to enhance its democratic governance and build up its national institutions, he said, noting that 2018 saw further steps to fight corruption and enhance good governance. municipal elections were successfully held with the strong participation of women and youth. noting that tunisia views the protection and promotion of the human rights of all its citizens as one of its international obligations, he described the establishment of a new committee to promote the empowerment of women. achieving economic reform and civic peace also requires the strong inclusion of young people, the continuation of reforms, accelerating the country’s growth rate, creating job opportunities and encouraging investment. despite recent regional developments and their impacts on tunisia, there have been strides in each of those areas, he said. for example, the tourism sector has been recently revitalized and is drawing new foreign investment. underlining the importance of partnerships with neighbors in the region as well as states around the world, he said such cooperation will promote all their interests. noting that terrorism is one of the gravest challenges facing both his country and the international community as a whole, he expressed support for the united nations office of counter‑terrorism and other global efforts to combat that phenomenon. “facing up to extremist ideologies and immunizing societies – especially youth – from the currents of terrorism is extremely important to us,” he said, voicing particular support for information sharing among states and for national efforts to strengthen security while fully respecting human rights and the rule of law. meanwhile, he said, the phenomenon of migration remains both an important exchange between nations as well as a global challenge. calling for efforts to address the root causes of today’s forced migration - including exploitation, poverty and the absence of sustainable development – he said the two compacts on migration slated to be finalized in morocco in december should become road maps forward on that critical issue. he said that while he understands some states’ apprehension, extreme ideas around the issue of migration must be avoided. he voiced support for the plight of the palestinian people, the two‑state solution and the work of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east (unrwa), while also expressing concern about the situation in libya and other parts of the african continent. furthermore, he underlined his country’s readiness to take up a non‑permanent seat on the security council from 2020 to 2021."
Turkey,,"recep tayyip erdoğan, president of turkey, said the united nations has moved away from meeting the expectations of humanity for peace and welfare, particularly as the security council only serves the interests of its veto‑right-holding members. stressing that turkey will continue to be on the side of the oppressed palestinian people and to protect the historical legal status of jerusalem, he called for comprehensive reform to the structure and functioning of the united nations, adding that budget reform alone will not address the organization’s problems. he went on to identify justice as one of the most important tasks that can be performed through the united nations, noting that the circle of justice has been shattered in many parts of the world. citing the enormous global wealth gap, migration and infant mortality rates, he called for a global administration system to help the impoverished and give future generations hope. to date, his country has spent $32 billion hosting 4 million refugees. further, it has secured the idlib de-escalation area in syria, allowing for humanitarian aid to reach millions, despite a lack of external support. he also noted that his country is contributing to the work of the united nations through substantial initiatives, including: the mediation for peace initiative, the organization of islamic cooperation, efforts to implement a development program in somalia, efforts to resolve the gulf crisis and actively responding to developments in syria. the recent sochi agreement signed with the russian federation has prevented bloody assaults in a region of syria where 3 million civilians live. that accord will clear the way for a peaceful solution to the crisis. countries that support terrorist organizations and closed borders to refugees will not secure a safer and more prosperous future, he stressed. turning to the threat of terrorism, he said that not all terrorist organizations obtained their power through armed actions. many engage through covert and deceptive methods. he pointed to “fetö [fethullahçı terör örgütü], which attempted a coup d’état” in 2016, and which has done so through non‑governmental organizations, among other “glossy concepts”, he said. although it has been eliminated from the country, the organization was now active in other parts of the world. several countries have not heeded warnings of the risks posed by that group, including the united states where the organization receives government funds in 27 states. trade wars are harmful to humanity, he said, stressing that states must not remain silent in the face of spreading protectionism and the use of economic sanctions as a weapon. the international community must work together to prevent damaging the world trade regime. however, some countries were persistently trying to create chaos. turkey is in favor of free trade and movement of persons. lastly, highlighting both youth and the elderly, he called for the establishment of a united nations youth organization, to be based in istanbul, as youth is the future of the world. he also noted that the united nations international agency on aging was being established in istanbul, where the third world assembly on aging will take place."
Turkmenistan,"statement by the president of turkmenistan his excellency mr. gurbanguly berdimuhamedov at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly dear mr. (mrs.) preside t, de r heads of deleg tio s, ladies nd ge tleme , first of all, allow me to congratulate mrs. maria fernanda espinosa garces on her election to the post of the 73rd session of the un general assembly and wish her success in the forthcoming responsible work. i would also like to express my appreciation to mr. miroslav lajcak, president of the 72nd session on his knowledgeable and effective work on this post. disti uished p rticip nts, the current session of the general assembly is taking place against the background of complex trends in international politics. in spite of the efforts, of the international community, primarily represented by the united nations, situation in a number of regions of the globe continues to remain complicated and we witness a proliferation of conflict prone areas and simultaneously with this a decrease in the general level of trust and mutual understanding in our views on the ways and prospects of global development. under those circumstances the issue of ensuring general, reliable and long-term security becomes all too apparent and acute thereby imposing the responsibility for mankind s destiny on every state. we believe that the united nations is called upon to play the main and decisive role in preserving the foundations of international order on the basis of the principles of mutual respect and peaceful political dialog. the validity of this mission of the united nations cannot be cast in doubt. the united nations is the only universal international organization designed to ensure multilateral cooperation aimed at strengthening inte ational security and sustainable development. turkmenistan believes that the current ga session is called upon to contribute to the solution of the crisis of trust and strengthen mutual understanding among member states. in this regard turkmenistan advances the initiative of marking the year 2019 as the year of peace and trust. our initiative envisages elaboration of specific measures aimed at reducing tensions, peaceful political and diplomatic resolution of disputes and contradictions and adoption of appropriate responsible and substantiated decisions. distinguished members of the delegations, ensuring long-term and comprehensive security represents a key issue fo the central asian states. fight against terrorism is the most important issue of the regional agenda. however, cooperation on disarmament matters, fight against drug trafficking and omni-lateral economic support for afghanistan is a no less important issue with respect to ensuring security and stable development. in this regard we believe that it is crucially important to involve afghanistan in the implementation of major energy, transport and communications projects as a full-fledged partner. we regard this issue as a strategic guideline for afghanistan, its role in regional and global processes and the guarantee of the prosperity and well-being of the afghan people. by steadfastly working towards this goal our country is implementing the project of building the turkmenistan-afghanistan - pakistan-india (tapi) gas line, carrying out the construction of a power supply line and a fiber optic communications network that are supported by inte ational partners and major financial institutions. a new railway leading towa ds afghanistan has also been completed. we continue to provide humanitarian assistance to afghanistan by building social facilities, sending humanitarian aid convoys, training of qualified national specialists for various segments of the afghan economy and social sphere. disti g ished participa ts, turkmenistan has taken an active part in the4 elaboration of the sustainable development agenda for the period up to the year 2030 and has tabled a number of specific proposals. following the adoption by the world summit of the global agenda and sustainable development goals our country was among the first nations that embarked on the adaptation of the sdgs to its national plans and social and economic development programs. in this regard we have established the appropriate standing mechanism for cooperation with the united nations. implementation of the sdgs in turkmenistan has an especially prominent social orientation. by this we mean such important issues as ensuring food security and improvement of people s nutrition, all-round promotion of a healthy way of life, ensuring full gender equality by guaranteeing the rights and opportunities for all women and girls, and creating the conditions for a comprehensive, equitable and high-quality education. parallel to this we devote great attention to achieving the goal of ensuring the availability and rational use of water resources and sanitation for all. disting ished particip nts! turkmenistan firmly adheres to the principle stipulating that water is the common heritage of all the nations of the planet and that equal and equitable access to clean drinking water is the fundamental right of human beings. development of states, their economy and social sphere as. well as the level of well-being and quality of life of the people directly depends on access to water resources and their effective use. therefore equality of rights, mutual respect and responsibility should become the main criteria that determine relations among central asian states. by steadfastly adhering to those p sitions turkmenistan has always declared that water and energy issues existing in our region should be resolved: - first, on the basis of generally accepted rules of international law; - second, on the basis of the consideration of the interests of each country; - third, on the basis of active participation of international organizations and primarily of the united nations. this is our principled position and proceeding from it we shall continue our work on building effective negotiating mechanisms between state an inte ational entities with a view to elaborating coordinated approaches. i am convinced that only by doing so can we achieve positive results and ensure a stable and sustainable balance of interests. the issue of saving the aral sea stands prominently among the major topics of cooperation between the countries of the region and the international community. it is apparent that preservation of the aral sea can no longer be considered as an internal regional problem. its successful solution requires assistance from the international community, an innovative purpose oriented and comprehensive international approach and systematic participation of the united nations in this endevour. in this connection we have embarked on the implementation of turkmenistan s initiative regarding the elaborati n of a special u program for the aral sea basin and earmarking the aral problem as a separate sphere of organization s work. i call on the united nations member states to support our initiative. the un resolution on the cooperation between the united nations and the international fund for saving the aral sea adopted by consensus on 18 april this year can serve as a good basis for this. distin uished participants, the caspian sea is yet another major issue. the signing of the convention on the legal status of the caspian sea by heads of the caspian sea states on the august 12 this year opens prospects for transforming the caspian sea region into one of the strategic transit transport and energy hubs of international importance, an area of broad investment, trade and economic activity and cooperation. turkmenistan stands ready to meaningfully discuss with all interested parties the implementation of projects in those spheres that are fully economically and commercially feasible and are beneficial for all potential participants, can significantly influence strengthening of continental security and have a long-term nature. it is no exaggeration to say that investment in those projects is an investment in the future. we highly value effective participation of the un specialized agencies epresented in turkmenistan in the life of our country and its dynamic development and well-being and i would like to express our specific gratitude to the personnel of those agencies for their selfless work. i would also like to thank un secretary general mr. antonio guterres for his constant personal attention to un cooperation with turkmenistan and support of our initiatives and endeavors.","gurbanguly berdimuhamedov, president of turkmenistan, said the world was witnessing a proliferation of conflict prone areas and a decrease in trust and mutual understanding of global development. under such circumstances, it is vital to ensure long-term security and every state has a responsibility for mankind’s destiny. the united nations plays a main, decisive role in preserving the international order. “the validity of the mission of the united nations cannot be cast in doubt,” he said, stressing that it is the only universal international organization designed to ensure multilateral cooperation aimed at strengthening international security and sustainable development. proposing that 2019 be declared “a year of peace and trust”, he said the initiative envisions specific steps on reducing tensions, peacefully resolving political disputes and adopting appropriate decisions. the fight against terrorism is the most important issue on the central asian agenda, he stressed, noting that cooperation on disarmament, the fight against drug trafficking and economic support for afghanistan were equally vital for ensuring security and sustainable development. afghanistan should be a full-fledged partner in the implementation of energy, transport and communication projects, he said, as a strategy for guiding that country’s role in regional and global processes and guaranteeing the prosperity and well-being of the afghan people. turkmenistan is constructing a power supply line and a fiber-optic communications network as part of the turkmenistan-afghanistan-pakistan-india gas line project. a new railway towards afghanistan has also been completed. turkmenistan continues to provide humanitarian support to afghanistan, including by building social facilities, sending aid convoys, and training qualified specialists in various economic and social sectors. he recalled that turkmenistan was among the first nations to adapt the sustainable development goals into its national plans and social and economic development programs, establishing a standing cooperation mechanism with the united nations towards that end. such plans and programs focus on ensuring food security, improving nutrition, promoting healthy lifestyles, ensuring full gender equality and creating the conditions for comprehensive, equitable and high-quality education. great attention is also given to ensuring the availability and rational use of water resources and sanitation for all. water is the common heritage of all the nations of the planet, he said, stressing: “equal and equitable access to clean drinking water is the fundamental right of human beings.” socioeconomic development and quality of life directly depends on access to and effective use of water resources. turkmenistan has always maintained that the resolution of water and energy issues in the region should be based on international law, the interests of each country and the active participation of international organizations, primarily the united nations. on saving the aral sea, he said it could no longer be considered solely an internal regional problem, but one that requires international assistance and a comprehensive approach. he called on member states to support turkmenistan’s initiative to set up a special united nations program for the aral sea basin and establish the aral problem as a separate item for consideration. the general assembly resolution on cooperation between the united nations and international fund for saving the aral sea, adopted by consensus on 18 april, could serve as a good basis. the signing of the convention on the legal status of the caspian sea on 12 august 2018 will transform the region into a strategic transit, transport and energy hub. turkmenistan stands ready to meaningfully discuss project implementation with all interested parties, he said, stressing that investments in these projects is an investment in the future."
Tuvalu,"tuvalu presented by prime minister of tuvalu honorable enele sosene sopoang at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly general debate september 27, 2017 new york president of the general assembly excellencies ladies and gentlemen 1. it gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the government and people of tuvalu, to address the general assembly, and to congratulate you on your appointment to the presidency of our 73rd session. tuvalu has full confidence in your leadership, and that together with the secretary general s support, to further advance our work. 2. tuvalu also re-affirms its commitment to the noble values and principles of the un, of which it has high pride to be member since we joined in the year 2000. 3. tuvalu acknowledges with sincere affections the passing of the late kofi anan, former secretary general, and his outstanding contributions to this body, leading us from the dusk of the past century, into the dawn of the twenty-first century. 73rd unga session 4. president, we welcome the theme of the 73nd general debate, making the united nations relevant for all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. 5. it rightly reminds us that we now need responsible global leadership more than ever. leadership that values multilateralism, trust and the moral responsibility to help those who need help. this is the leadership the world needs to succeed against the defining global challenges of the un sdgs in particular of climate change and environmental degradation. unsg high level events during the high-level week 6. this year was characterized by the fear of a potential nuclear war as if we have not learnt from the wrongs of the past. now we have nuclear weapons that are much more powerful than those dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki. 1 7. numerous nuclear tests in our pacific region have caused unimaginable damages to the environment and health of our people. some of our islands are still coping with the effects of nuclear radiation decades after those nuclear tests. the recent pacific leaders meeting in nauru reaffirmed our commitment to peace and security in the pacific region. under the boe declaration on pacific regional security, we are calling for urgent actions not only on military, but on human security issues as well. 8. in this spirit, tuvalu two days ago, signed the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty (ctbt), which offers the international community an opportunity to ban this weaponry. we urge all of us to take up concrete actions to make our world safe. non-communicable diseases and tuberculosis 9. non-communicable diseases and tuberculosis hit the poor and vulnerable particularly hard and drive them deeper into poverty. we commend the successful outcomes of the high-level meetings of the general assembly on ncds and tb convened by the un secretary general, but the rhetoric alone is not enough, they must be followed by meaningful actions on the ground to drive healthy life-styles and diets, supported by adequate financing and monitoring modalities to ensure integrated progress. 10. addressing this in a manner of urgency is critical, and to this end in tuvalu, we have introduced an all friday afternoon sweat-breaks to all workers in work places, and in the villages to encourage more active and healthy life-style, through more physical activities like sporting, gardening, and fishing. climate change and the paris agreement 11. for sids and ldcs, however, the achievement of the un sustainable development goals, depends entirely on how we can address issues of climate change. current global warming trend spells a very bleak and miserable future for 2 sids, especially for low-lying atolls like tuvalu. a future that demands huge investments on mitigation and adaptation that are simply beyond our capabilities. 12. the paris agreement offers us a lifeline. but the current commitments in the paris agreement constitutes only a third of what is needed to avoid catastrophic consequences of climate change. this is a direct threat to our existence and survival. 13. as already established based on the ipcc s assessments, unless the global community steps up our actions to significantly lower ghg emissions, sids like tuvalu will disappear completely within the next 30-50 years - disappear completely. i repeat again what i said in cop21, paris, just imagine if you were in my shoes, how would you feel? and what would you do? 14. climate change is a weapon of mass destruction. it is slaughtering fellow human beings world-over. the un cannot and must not allow the biggest ghg emitters to turn away from their moral duty to urgently reduce ghg emissions, and to save sids like tuvalu with appropriate adaptation support. it will be shameful for the whole of humanity to ever allow tuvalu disappear. every single year wasted with no actions on climate change, draws tuvalu a year closer to its total demise from earth. but tuvalu will never give up, we will fight to protect and save our islands, our people, our culture, and our future. 15. we appeal to this noble house not to allow this to happen. tuvalu, whose islands and lagoons were used by the american forces in the second world war to conquer the enemy in the pacific, urges president trump and the usa to re-join the paris agreement, so we can all paddle together to save the world against our single most threatening enemy of climate change. failing this, tuvalu strongly proposes that we the signatories of the paris agreement must quickly return to paris to critically and urgently re-assess our mitigation pledges and dramatically increase our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. we cannot allow one country to desert the process and derail our efforts. 3 16. the next conference of parties in poland is a critically important milestone for climate change action. we must ensure that the implementation guidelines for the paris agreement are concluded. we must also ensure that the talanoa dialog process leads to a strong political declaration and decision that responds to the ipcc 1.5 deg c report and sets a pathway for enhanced climate change action. 17. in this regard we seek a commitment from every nation to enhance their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a matter of urgency. on our own part, tuvalu is fully committed to shi ting to 100% renewable energy by 2020 despite our negligent greenhouse gas emissions. i extend our deep appreciation to the governments of india and france for their initiative on solar energy development, under the international solar alliance, and to the eu, nz, taiwan, italy, austria, japan and the world bank for their support on energy efficiency and solar energy development in tuvalu. 18. i wish to acknowledge the efforts of notable members of the security council in bringing climate change to the fore of its peace and security agenda. this is a genuine commitment to addressing the most important challenge of our time and the greatest single threat to humanity. it is our humble hope that the whole of the security council membership can agree to have climate change as a permanent item on its agenda. 19. madam president, we believe that the nexus between climate change and security is fundamental. for a nation like tuvalu our security and our future are contingent on urgent action to address climate change. we therefore reiterate our call for the appointment of a special representative of the un secretary general on climate change and security. the special representative will hopefully create the necessary catalyst for a un wide response to climate change and security. 20. we also call on the security council to appoint a special rapporteur to produce regular review of global, regional and national security threats caused by climate change. 4 global compact on migration 21. we welcome the successful conclusion of the intergove mental negotiation on the global compact on migration and applaud the spirit of responsible leadership and multilateral cooperation to support the ever-increasing populations that are being affected by conflicts and environmental crisis including climate change. 22. we believe however, that all human rights of climate change displaced people should be protected under an international legal agreement. we therefore reiterate the tuvalu proposal for a un resolution on the establishment of a legal process to protect the human rights of people displaced by climate change. the proposal is fully supported by the polynesian leaders group, the sis leaders, and in the pacific island country leaders. ldc graduation 23 this year tuvalu has proposed to remain an ldc because our ability to achieve sustainable development is being severely compromised by our vulnerability to climate change. we noted with appreciation the support that we have received from development partners on our proposal. 24. however, it is our earnest belief that sids unique extreme vulnerabilities must be considered as a fundamental criteria of graduation from the ldc category. sids 25. the particular concerns of highly vulnerable sids, like tuvalu, cannot be ignored. in our nssd, te kakeega iii, our unique vulnerability is recognized as enemy number one to sdgs achievement. in this regard we call on ecosoc to create a special category for sids so that we can be afforded special considerations in a similar fashion to ldcs. 26. we note the un secretary general s recently released report on the assessment resulting from the evolving mandates of the small island developing 5 states units of the secretariat . the expanded responsibilities of the sids unit in undesa and the ohrlls should be matched with expanded resources. we strongly urge the un secretary general to make available additional resource for these units. we also believe that all un agencies should identity and develop special programs for sids. 27. we elcome the review of the s.a.m.o.a. pathway and hope that this review will truly reflect and respond to the unique circumstances of sids and their extreme economic, environmental and social vulnerability and direct action to address this vulnerability. 28. in the south pacific region, we are making small steps to address this vulnerability. we are in the process of developing a pacific island climate change insurance facility. we seek support from the un wide system to assist us in developing this facility. ocean 29. madam president, our small island economy is inextricably linked to the oceans. the oceans is us, our culture, our life and our survival. for us, it is the source of life: food, ecosystems, biodiversity, freshwater, and economies. the ocean presents our greatest hope to achieving sustainable livelihoods for our people, security and survival. flowever, with global warming, acidification, coral bleaching, solid wastes and plastic pollution, inshore and off-shore fish-stocks on which national economies dependent, are gravely affected. the un must provide the strongest leadership to drive genuine partnerships to address these issues. 30. it is therefore very important that the interests of small islands developing states are reflected in the ongoing discussions on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity including beyond areas of national jurisdiction. we seek international cooperation that ensures our equal and fair participation in the 6 management and sharing of benefits from the oceans including in areas beyond national jurisdictions. taiwan, cuba, west papua 31. madam president, the exclusion of taiwan from the un systems denied its 23 million people their fundamental rights to participate, benefit and contribute to the un sustainable development goals. already taiwan is a responsible and able partner to tuvalu and many countries around the world and could only do more if it is allowed its rightful place and role in our global efforts. 32. the un has to make the necessary arrangements to let taiwan participate in its meetings, activities, and mechanisms. tuvalu strongly supports the roc/taiwan active participation in un specialized agencies including in the unfccc, who, and icao. 33. in a similar manner, the long unilateral economic embargo on cuba directly constraints the development aspiration of the people of cuba. it neglected the human rights and the spirit of cooperation espoused in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. 34. likewise, our united nations must engage with the people of west papua to find lasting solutions to their struggles. 3 5. madam president, the 203 0 agenda is a plan of action for people, planet, and prosperity, and was adopted on the basis of the principles of inclusiveness and universality. we must therefore engage every country and every people for a successful 2030 agenda. pif 2019 in tuvalu 36. next year in august 2019, tuvalu will host the 50th pacific islands forum of leaders. i extend our humble invitation to all pif leaders, our friends and especially 7 our development partners, bilateral and multilateral, to join us in tuvalu. we want to put on record our deepest appreciation to the government of taiwan for their generous support to help us prepare for this important regional event. similarly i want to acknowledge similar support from the governments of india, taiwan, and the rok to host the pit summit. 37. on 1st of october, tuvalu will celebrate its 40th anniversary of independence. whilst holding high our national pride in being an independent nation, we fully acknowledge that tuvalu would never have achieved such a status without the due consideration of members of this august body to whom we offer our sincere gratitude. in our stride, we acknowledge with deep appreciation the generosity of all our development partners, particularly our traditional partners the republic of china, taiwan, india, republic of korea, australia, new, new zealand, the eu, japan, uk, world bank, and asian development bank. as we paddle our canoe over the next forty years, we seek for the continuing goodwill of the un family, to further advancing our achievements based on genuine and durable partnerships. 38. in conclusion, tuvalu strongly believes that our collective effort to achieve the sustainable development agenda 2030, and to secure global peace, security and prosperity, will be severely compromised unless we all paddle together to urgently address climate change: to save tuvalu, to save the world. i thank you madam president tuvalu mo te atua 8","enele sosene sopoaga, prime minister of tuvalu, said that, more than ever, the world needs leadership that values multilateralism, trust and the moral responsibility to help those in need. recalling that 2018 has been characterized by the fear of nuclear war “as if we have not learnt from the wrongs of the past”, he said the pacific region is still coping with the effects of nuclear tests carried out decades ago. through the boe declaration on pacific regional security, pacific leaders are calling for urgent action on human as well as military security, he said, adding that it was in that spirit that tuvalu two days ago signed the comprehensive nuclear‑test‑ban treaty. while commending the successful outcome of this week’s high‑level meetings on non‑communicable diseases and tuberculosis, he said rhetoric alone is not enough. healthy lifestyles and diets must be promoted as a matter of urgency, supported by adequate financing and monitoring to ensure integrated progress. for its part, he said, tuvalu has introduced friday afternoon “sweat breaks” for all workers and has encouraged villagers to pursue more physical activities such as fishing and gardening. for small island developing states and least developed countries, achieving the sustainable development goals depends on how the world tackles climate change, he said. current global warming trends point to a very bleak and miserable future for low‑lying atolls like tuvalu – a future that demands huge investments for mitigation and adaptation that are simply beyond their capabilities. “climate change is a weapon of mass destruction. it is slaughtering fellow human beings worldwide,” he said. the united nations must not allow the biggest greenhouse gas emitters to turn away from their moral duty to reduce their emissions and to save small island developing states like tuvalu with adaptation support. every single year without action on climate change will draw tuvalu a year closer to its demise, he said, appealing to the assembly not to let that happen. describing the upcoming conference of the parties to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change as a critical milestone, he acknowledged efforts in the security council to add climate change to that body’s peace and security agenda. he reiterated tuvalu’s call for the appointment of a special representative of the secretary‑general for climate change and security, as well as a special rapporteur who would report on security threats caused by climate change. in addition, he repeated his country’s proposal for the united nations to establish a legal process to protect the human rights of those displaced by climate change. he went on to call on the united nations to provide strong leadership to drive genuine partnerships to address ocean‑related issues, including acidification, coral bleaching, solids waste and plastic pollution, and both inshore and offshore fisheries. the interests of small island developing states must be reflected in ongoing discussions on marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. on taiwan, he said the united nations must enable it to participate in its meetings, activities and mechanisms. he added that the unilateral economic embargo on cuba neglects that country’s human rights and spirit of cooperation. likewise, the united nations must engage with the people of west papua to find a lasting solution to their struggle, he said."
Uganda,"republic of uganda address by rt hon dr ruhakana rugunda prime minister of the republic of uganda at the general debate of the 73*° session of the united nations general assembly 27 september 2018 new york [] 1 excellencies heads of state and government, president of the un general assembly, secretary general of united nations, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, i congratulate ms. maria fernanda espinosa on her election as president of t e 73rd session of the un general assembly and assure her of uganda s support. we are confident that she will lead the assembly effectively and successfully. i would also like to express our gratitude to h.e. mr miroslav lajcak, for his leadership of the 72nd session. i pay tribute to the secretary-general, h.e. antonio guterres, for his personal dedication and commitment to the work of the united nations. the theme for this 73rd session making united nations relevant to all people is very pertinent. three years ago in this hall, we adopted a universal and transformative agenda 2030 for sustainable development, to guide our efforts over the next fifteen years. at the heart of the 2030 agenda was a pledge to leave noone behind"". it meant that the seventeen sustainable development goals (sdgs) and targets should be met for everyone, with a particular focus on the poorest, most vulnerable and furthest behind - indeed those who are often the hardest to reach. we in uganda are devoting reasonable amount of time and resources to follow through on the implementation of the agenda and establish links between the sdgs and our national priorities. we are deliberately working to ensure that the sdgs are implemented in an effective and timely manner for socio-economic transformation and improvement of our people’s livelihoods. to do so, we have integrated over 76% of the sdgs into the national development plan for the period 2015-2020, as part of uganda vision 2040. 2 from our engagements thus far, it is evident that the biggest challenge remains inadequate financing to implement the 2030 agenda - a issue that came out clearly in the high-level political forum held here in new york last june. we in uganda, are doing our best to mobilize resources, both domestic a d external, for implementation of the sdgs. we are committed to leveraging support into productive areas, including the private sector, which has the potential of boosting our economy a d thereby contributing additional internally generated resources for im lementing the sdgs. we call upon development partners to fulfill their commitments and extend support in terms of timely and adequate means for its implementation; prioritize the special needs of the most vulnerable countries; and strengthen partnerships. madam president our development and transformation cannot take place without peace and securit - these are prerequisites for socio-economic transformation. we should give attention to supporting an environment that is peaceful, thus enabling us to concentrate on growth and development. today s challenges transcend borders and no country, alone, can can the weight of the world on its shoulders. we must redouble our collective efforts to seek common solutions to various pressing regional and global challenges including conflicts in various parts of the world; transnational organized crime, terrorism and violent extremism. 3 we must be unwavering in our resolve to combat terrorism. religious extremism and terrorism from groups like al-shabaab, boko haram, isis and a1 qaida constitute threats to our common security and development. this threat is compounded today given the possibility of the linkage between terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. these are challenges that cut across national boundaries and require collective responses. madam president uganda remains committed to multilateralism as a means to achieving comprehensive and equitable solutions to global problems and challenges. in order to respond successfully to global crises, threats and challenges, the international community needs an efficient multilateral system. it is for this reason that uganda has continued to advance the cause for a revitalized, reformed and effective united nations system. this is critical to make the un more responsive, efficient and effective in its support to the member states efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals. uganda supports the comprehensive reform of the un security council and our approach is consistent with the continent’s common position, as enunciated in the ezulwini consensus. first, african issues dominate the security council agenda and therefore the vast majority of decisions made by the council affect african countries. second, over the last few years, africa has shown its commitment to conflict prevention, mediation and resolution as demonstrated by its leadership and response to conflict situations on the continent. we believe that for a continent with 54 countries, a population of over one billion people and demonstrable political commitment, the continent should have a bigger voice in the global political debate which will increase the legitimacy of the decisions of the council and foster its effectiveness. it is essential that the security 4 council s membership, in the permanent and non-permanent category, is equitable and reflects today’s geopolitical realities. we therefore, support efforts of members states to move the intergovernmental negotiations process forward, and call for a constr cti e s irit in order to realize the long-awaited reform. madam president strengthening south-south cooperation is critical for the achievement of the sustainable development goals. in the forty years of its existence, south-south cooperation has prove to be a valuable avenue for building capacit and promoting development in developing countries. it has also facilitated cooperation manifested in the south-south and triangular cooperation. it is our desire that we expand the scope of south-south cooperation to include; among others; trade, investment, infrastructure, tourism, peacebuilding and other areas of mutual interest. we look forward to the forthcoming united nations ministerial conference on south-south cooperation in buenos aires, which we hope will dedicate time to consider how to strengthen and further revitalize this cooperation, within the context of a global partnership for sustainable development. madam president the un has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. however, in undertaking this role it is essential that it supports initiatives undertaken by regional and sub-regional organizations. this partnership should be based on division of labor and burden sharing, complementarity, and mutual respect. in africa, the evidence is that where this cooperation has happened, the results have been positive. one example is the cooperation between the un and the au on the situation in somalia, where amisom has supported the efforts of the government to stabilize 5 that country. uganda has played an active role in these regional initiatives. since amisom s deployment 11 years ago, we have witnessed tremendous progress in somalia. • the somali government previously based out of the country has been based in mogadishu since 2007; • international organizations including the united nations and diplomatic missions have also relocated to mogadishu; • more than 80% of al-shabaab dominated areas have been liberated; • the threat of piracy at sea that threatened international shipping and trade has been neutralized; • business is thriving and there are many reconstruction activities in many parts of the country and • regular elections have been held. these positive developments and somalia s relative stability would hardly have been possible without the contribution and sacrifice of amisom and the somali security forces. uganda appreciates the support that the african union and international partners have given to amisom. amisom was never intended to be in somalia forever. that is why it is essential that somalia is supported to provide security for its people. it is crucial that any reduction in the troops of amisom corresponds with the strengthening of the somali security forces. the failure to carefully manage this process could imperil the political and security gains already made. on south sudan, uganda has actively participated in the igad-led peace process launched in june 2017, and we welcome the recently signed revitalized agreement on resolution of conflict in south sudan (arcss). 6 the agreement outlines guidelines on power sharing and governance, security arrangements, including settling bo ndary disputes which will be guided by a boundary commission. we call on the international community to support the implementation of the agreement. madam president climate change remains a major challenge and a threat to our efforts to achieve sustainable development. uganda supported efforts to reach a new, universally-binding climate change agreement reached in paris, in december 2015. uganda was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the agreement last year. we must continue to muster the necessary political will to fully implement the agreement. there is a need for the enhanced delivery of finance to the most vulnerable countries to support their climate change mitigation and adaption measures. as highlighted in agenda 2030, we can be the first generation to succeed in ending poverty; just as we may be the last to have a chance of saving the pla et let all of us commit to preventing wars and promoting peace. let us build new international relations. let us reduce inequalities. let us ensure that no one is left behind and let us uphold the primary role of the united nations as the principal organization for addressing global challenges. madam president the adoption of the 2030 agenda coincided with the onset of what would become uganda s single largest refugee influx in our history. as a country, we now hosts 1.4 million the largest refugees on the african continent and ranking high in the world. 7 the presence of large numbers of refugees mostly arriving unexpectedly and quickly amplifies the existing vulnerability of host communities. it also places huge demands on alreadystretched national capacities and resources. uganda remains committed to maintaining and promoting asylum space and its refugee model consistent with the new york declaration. we do this because we know that no one chooses to be a refugee and also understa d the critical importance of treating refugees humanely, decently a d with dignity. we also remain committed to working with national, regional and international actors, in addressing the drivers of displacement and refugees. we are grateful for the solidarity and support the international community has extended to uganda thus far. it is our expectation that that the new global compact on refugees will provide the much needed predictable and equitable burden and responsibilit sharing, among all member states. finally, uganda remains ready to work with the un secretary general and all the member states to realize a united nations that is more inclusive, effective and responsive to the needs of the peoples of the world. i thank you 8","ruhakana rugunda, prime minister of uganda, said that his country’s development transformation cannot take place without peace and security. uganda must be unwavering in its resolve to combat terrorism. religious extremism and terrorism from groups like al‑shabaab and boko haram severely threaten security and development. the threat is compounded today given the possibility of the linkage between terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. uganda remains committed to multilateralism as a means of achieving comprehensive and equitable solutions to global challenges. to respond successfully to global crises, the international community needs an efficient multilateral system. uganda supports comprehensive reform of the security council, he continued, noting that african issues dominate the body’s agenda. for a continent of 54 countries, africa must have a bigger voice in the global political debate. this would also help increase the legitimacy of council decisions. strengthening south‑south cooperation is also essential for the achievement of the 2030 agenda. in the 40 years of its existence, south‑south cooperation has proven to be a valuable avenue for building capacity and promoting development in developing countries. he said that since the deployment of the african union mission in somalia (amisom) some 11 years ago, the country has seen tremendous progress. the somali government, previously based out of the country, moved back to mogadishu in 2007. more than 80 per cent of areas dominated by al‑shabaab have been liberated. such positive developments would have hardly been possible without the contribution and sacrifice of the mission and somali security forces. thus, any reduction in mission troops must correspond with the strengthening of somali troops. on south sudan, he welcomed the recently signed revitalized agreement on resolution of conflict in south sudan. climate change remains a major challenge to uganda achieving sustainable development, he said, expressing support for the climate pact signed in paris. “we must continue to muster the necessary political will to fully implement the agreement,” he stressed. financing the most vulnerable countries is critical for their ability to mitigate climate change. the adoption of the 2030 agenda coincided with the onset of what would become uganda’s single largest refugee influx in history. “we now host 1.4 million, the largest number of refugees on the african continent,” he said. uganda remains committed to ensuring its refugee model is consistent with the new york declaration. “we do this because we know that no one chooses to be a refugee and understand the critical importance of treating refugees humanely,” he continued. the new global compact on refugees will help share the responsibility and burden among all member states."
Ukraine,"draft statement by the president of ukraine during the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies distinguished madam president, excellences, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of ukraine, i congratulate madam president on the election as president of the 73rd session of the general assembly. we support outlined priorities and are ready to do our share in translatingthem into reality. our deliberations are taking place at a defining moment for the organization. despite the universal appeal for peace and declared commitment to uphold it, wars and armed conflicts remain our reality. conflicts are the main reason for the rise in refugees and displaced persons worldwide to the unprecedented figure of 65.5 million. since no peace means no development, hundreds of millions are doomed to misery. the international security environment seemed rock-solid less than two decades ago. now it has descended into a volatile and increasingly disturbing state where both traditional and hybrid threats are challenging stability of our societies. too often lofty rhetoric on peace, respect for international law, and commitment to human rights remains just that - rhetoric, nice sounding words, politically correct messages, which> however, are not backed by concrete actions. we may become tempted to talk about achievements or grand plans for the future. 2 however, from our perspective, addressing fundamental problems that the un and the international community as a whole face is much more important. we shall never forget that the raison d etre of this organization is to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . madam president, unfortunately, my fellow citizens have become a part of that one-fifth of the world population who is experiencing the horrors of war. as 1 deliver my speech, reports have brought a sad news about another human life just lost on the frontlines of the war inflicted upon my country by the permanent member of the un security council. yesterday, and the day before, several families, again, were struck by grief, as their loved ones perished under russia's hostile attacks. moscow turns ukrainian to orphans. it tortures our patriots in its prisons. over 1.5 million people became internally displaced persons. they still can't return to their homes. russia constantly multiplies the human tragedy, which lately received a new dimension: ecological. it poisons the ukrainian soil and causes an environmental disaster not only in the occupied crimea, but in donbas as well. this has been a daily reality for ukrainians for four years now. thousands of deaths, destruction, displacement and human suffering. for my fellow citizens, these years have become a tremendous challenge - a test for their determination and solidarity, resilience and faith. let us not forget what this war is about. ukraine made a sovereign decision to live its way and promote the free world based on democratic values and rules russia punishes ukraine for this decision. it kills. it ruins homes. it lies on industrial scale. it pretends that ukraine, as well as georgia attacked themselves . 3 do we know which neighbor of russia will attack itself"" next? or will the world be ""comfortably numb"" in a hope that ""the next one won t be me""? as we defend ukraine's land and our free choice, as we counter the resurging neo-imperialist power willing to divide the world anew - we defend the free world. the un shall not be silent, when the values and principles rooted in its charter and the entire body of international law are being violated by a veto country. this is not just a challenge, but our chance to make the united nations relevant and to make the motto of this assembly session work. madam president, how did such a deterioration in the world affairs happen? many assumed that the respect for peace and international law is a constant given. developments on international stage over the last decade have seriously undermined this confidence. appeasement and quick fixes to difficult problems have proven to be a false option. it has proven that staying comfortably silent when international norms are breached does not stop but encourages the offender to continue its destructive policies. your silence is exactly what the kremlin weaponizes against ukraine and, ultimately, against all of us! it's naive to believe that safe shores will always be around. there will be no safe shores, shall we allow someone to feel that he is not bound by any norms or restrictions. that he has a right to reshape the international system to his liking. that his interests are more legitimate than ours. in the absence of a strong and united reaction, such extremely irresponsible and selfish actor resorts to the tactic of further escalation, creating new crises, raising the stakes, blackmailing other countries and even entire international organizations. 4 all in an effort to get away with murder . we shall not allow this to happen. we shall bring the world back on track. what is the cure? in one word: responsibility. the international community's ability to ensure systemic and ine itable responsibility for each and every violation of international laws - first and foremost norms and principles of the un charter - is the benchmark indicating how successful we, as the family of nations can be in achieving common goals. ensuring responsibility is never an easy feat. let me be clear on this point: nothing will stop moscow from continuing its aggressive expansionist policies if it does not face a united stand of the international community, if punishment for its actions does not become inevitable. it is due to the lack of relevant punishment that after georgia came ukraine, that after lytvinenko came skrypals, that after aleppo came idlib... kremlin has no intention to stop. after occupation of crimea, it aims now at occupation of the sea of azov between ukraine and russia. having illegally constructed a bridge across the kerch strait, russia launched a systematic disruption of freedom of international navigation through the kerch strait for ukrainian and foreign ships. such brutal actions must be rejected as illegal, including under the un convention on the law of the sea. they require a strong response, including an enhanced sanctions policy and other targeted measures. efficiency of international actions often falls short of expectations and the relevance of the united nations itself is questioned. we must admit that the responsibility for fixing the current state of affairs rests with all of us collectively and each of us individually. if we are committed to building peaceful/equitable and sustainable societies, we protect the un charter, uphold its norms and principles, take resolute action to restore justice. 5 let me say it more precisely - the beautiful language of the charter worth nothing if it is not enforced. no more words time for deeds! the united nations must gain momentum as there are continued attempts to ruin the rules-based international order and revise internationally recognized state borders by force. this dangerous slide towards the world with no civilized rules has to be stopped. in this regard, there is a need to revitalize and strengthen the role of the general assembly in the sphere of international peace and security. with conflicts spreading, we have to ensure maximum flexibility and comprehensiveness of the agenda of the general assembly, which is the only inclusive and chief policy-making forum. that is why ukraine introduced the item the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of ukraine"" in the agenda of the current session of the general assembly. member states should be provided with every possibility for in-depth considerations of all urgent situations that require attention of the international community. as outlined by the general assembly president, we have to ""facilitate quick and effective responses of the general assembly to emergency situations"". ukraine, as one of vice-presidents ofthe 73rd session, stands ready to contribute to that. as member states, we ""conferred on the security council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security"". what shall we do if a veto holding member ofthe security council uses this right not to help international peace and stability, but to help itself escape from responsibility? it is time to say that the abuse of veto r ght is a brake that often does not allow our organization to really act. we believe thatthe progress on the security council reform will bean important contribution to the ongoing un-wide change. 6 we support launching text-based talks within the intergovernmental negotiations and are ready to engage constructively in this process. we also expect that the ongoing reform of the peace and security pillar envisaged by the secretary-general with the support of the general assembly, would contribute to the speed and abilities of the organization to react to the emerging threats to international peace and security. ukraine f lly shares the approach of the secretary-general on the peacekeeping activity of the organization within his concept of the action for peacekeeping (a4p) . it is a timely opportunity for member states and the un leadership to consider measures leading to effecting real changes in the un peacekeeping. the very same peacekeeping that ukraine has been asking the un to deploy on its territory since april 2015, when i addressed my request, supported by the parliament of ukraine, to the president of the security council, to the president of the general assembly and to the un secretary-general. after the failure of the un to prevent aggression against ukraine, we still hoped that the un would help settling the conflict by deploying an un-mandated multinational peacekeeping force in the occupied donbas. a mission, with a strong mandate and broad responsibilities to help bring peace on the ukrainian soil. rather than to freeze the conflict or cement the presence of the aggressor and its proxies in donbas. we firmly count on further progress on this important issue. after all, and perfectly in line with the topic of this general debate - ""making the united nations relevant to all people - it is through such a un security council-mandated pko that the un would save countless lives and prevent further sufferings. madam president, we remain as determined as ever to keep defending every inch of our territory against the aggression. at the same time, we will continue exploring all available means to end the conflict peacefully and restore the territorial integrity of ukraine. let me stress - ukraine has always put legal and diplomatic means of conflict resolution first. 7 we have prioritized multilateralism by turning for support of the united nations, osce, the council of europe and other international organizations, fora and mechanisms. and we will continue along that path. moscow shall feel the strength of the rule of international law. we initiated several legal cases against the russian side in international courts. on some of them we have already achieved important results. in particular, in the beginning of 2017 the international court of justice (icj) ordered russia to lift the ban on activities on mejlis - representative body of crimean tatars in the occupied crimea. however, russia continues to ignore the ruling demonstrating its disregard not only to its international obligations but to the court as well. another important element of our case in the icj it is the downing of mh17 in 2014 and the role of the russian federation in this tragedy. it is important that australia and the netherlands recently joined ukraine in its efforts to bring russia to account. the international community repeatedly calls russia to acknowledge its responsibility and change its destructive behavior in ukraine and elsewhere. we know that following the legal path is a lengthy process, but we are confident that at the end it will allow us to achieve justice. ladies and gentlemen, it has been almost four years since russia's attempted annexation and illegal occupation of crimea and sevastopol. under russian occupation, crimea has turned into a military stronghold threatening security and stability in the entire wider black sea region. we believe that increasing militarization of crimea deserves the general assembly's close attention and prompt reaction. russia s aggressive policies as well as its arrogance in using lethal weapons multiply the threat. in this regard, ukraine counts on your active support for the relevant resolution during this session. 8 since the first day of the illegal occupation of crimea, crimean tatars and ethnic ukrainians have faced repressions and discrimination. there are many cases of murders, tortures, harassment and arrests under fabricated charges. the list of hostages and victims of the russian occupation regime in crimea is getting longer almost every day. the ukrainian and crimean tatar identities seem to be a criminal offense in today's reality of the occupied peninsula. crimean farmer volodymyr balukh was arrested and sentenced to 5 years in prison for raising a ukrainian flag upon his private residence. crimean film director oleg sentsov remains behind the bars in a remote penal colony in northern russia serving a 20-years prison term on fabricated charges. both oleg and volodymyr are balancing between life and death as they remain on a hunger strike. i highly appreciate a remarkable manifestation of support and unity throughout the world to seek freedom for these brave persons. unfortunately, kremlin remains blind and deaf to these appeals of the international community and many of russia's intellectuals. i call upon un member states to strengthen their efforts in demanding respect for human rights in the temporarily occupied crimea through the adoption of the respective unga resolution. there are also dozens of ukrainians held by the occupants in donbas since the beginning of russian aggression in 2014. ukrainian soldier serhii glondar has never seen his youngest daughter, as he has been held captive for three and a half years. all ukrainian proposals to exchange the russian citizens convicted for crimes against our sovereignty and territorial integrity for the ukrainian citizens held as political prisoners by kremlin remained unanswered. it's just another side of russia's recklessness: first sending and inciting own citizens to this war - and simply abandoning them afterwards. this is the thing about today s russia: they don't care. 9 they don't care about suffering. they don't care about truth. they don't care about law. they think that their military might and status in the un give them this right. it's up to us to prove them wrong. it's up to us to make them care. otherwise what's the idea of us being here? otherwise what's the difference between the era before the un and with the un? in a broader context, ukraine has always considered protection of human rights as one of the cornerstones of the un activities. sustainable peace and security cannot be achieved in isolation from human rights. we therefore support the efforts to bring bac human rights issues to the un security council and to promote close cooperation among all relevant un bodies in this area. ladies and gentlemen, my country is delivering on its commitments under the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the sustainable development goals. ukraine's economy grew in the second quarter of 2018 at a 3.8% annual rate. this marks the tenth straight quarter of growth that is a clearly sustainable trend. the gdp increase was helped by macroeconomic stabilization, improved investment climate and clean-up of the banking sector. ukraine is demonstrating the best dynamics in growth among the emerging markets. despite heavy security and defense expenses totaling more than 6% of its gdp, ukraine is undergoing fundamental transformations on social, economic and political tracks. 10 we have consistently implemented progressive reforms - ranging from judicial, education, healthcare, public administration reforms to carrying out decentralization and fighting corruption. in 2019-2021, ukraine will take over an important responsibility as member of the united nations economic and social council. based on its extensive recent experience, my country looks forward to using its membership to strengthen the role of the council in foliowing-up and reviewing 2030 agenda and sustainable development goals, particularly when it comes to conflict and post-conflict settings. among 17 sustainable development goals ukraine particularly welcomes the un initiatives aimed at reducing global hunger. today, when more than 850 million people in the world are starving, my country cannot stand idle and is ready to offer the world its help in addressing the issue of food security. ukraine, like nobody, knows the price of this tragedy. this november we will mark 85th anniversary of one of the deadliest crimes of the 20th century - the crime of holodomor, mass starvation in ukraine artificially organized by the stalinist regime. it took lives of several millions of ukrainians. in this regard, i would like to renew my appeal to the assembly to mark one of the biggest tragedies in human history by adopting a dedicated declaration. madam president, our organization is only as strong as we want and allow it to be. therefore, our full support and strong political will are required to ensure that the united nations remains relevant in today's uncertain and turbulent times. relevant, as you rightly put it in the theme of this debate, to all people. it is our mission and shared responsibility to empower the united nations to do what is expected of the organization. to do it through our global leadership based on shared values -freedom, the rule of law and tolerance. thank you for your attention.","petro poroshenko, president of ukraine, said that the international security environment seemed rock solid just two decades ago. now it has descended into a volatile and increasingly disturbed state where both traditional and hybrid threats are challenging the stability of our societies. on 24 and 25 september, several families were again struck by grief, as their loved ones perished under russia’s hostile attacks. “moscow turns ukrainians to orphans. it tortures our patriots in its prisons,” he said. over 1.5 million people have been displaced since 2014. russia’s hostile attacks have also poisoned the ukrainian soil and have caused an environmental disaster not only in the occupied crimea, but in donbas as well. ukraine has made a sovereign decision to live the way it wants and to promote the free world’s democratic values, he continued, adding: “russia punishes ukraine for this decision.” it kills, ruins homes and lives on an industrial scale. he urged the united nations to speak up for ukraine’s rights. it has proven again and again that staying comfortably silent when international norms are breached does not stop but encourages the offender to continue destructive policies. “your silence is exactly what the kremlin weaponizes against ukraine and, ultimately, against all of us,” he said. in the absence of a strong and united reaction, irresponsible and selfish actors resort to the tactic of further escalation, he said. “ensuring responsibility is never an easy feat,” he added. nothing will stop moscow from continuing its aggressive expansionist policies if it does not face a united stand from the international community. a lack of punishment certified that after georgia came ukraine and after aleppo came idlib. brutal actions must be rejected as illegal. the responsibility for fixing the current state of affairs rests on all. that is why ukraine introduced the item “the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of ukraine” into the assembly’s current session. he said that progress on security council reform is essential, expressing support for launching text‑based talks within the intergovernmental negotiations. after the failure of the united nations to prevent aggression against ukraine, his country had hoped that the organization would help settle the conflict by deploying peacekeepers. “we firmly count on further progress on this important issue,” he said, adding that ukraine has prioritized multilateralism by turning to support from the united nations, the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce) and the council of europe. “moscow shall feel the strength of the rule of international law,” he continued, recalling the several legal cases ukraine initiated against russia in international courts. yet, russia continues to ignore relevant rulings, he continued, welcoming the efforts of australia and the netherlands to bring russia to account. he called on member states to strengthen their efforts in demanding respect for human rights in the temporarily occupied crimea through the adoption of various assembly resolutions. “this is the thing about today’s russia: they don’t care,” he said, adding that russia is careless about suffering, the truth and the law. “it is up to us to make them care,” he added."
United Arab Emirates,,"abdullah bin zayed al nahyan, minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation of united arab emirates, said the international order is being characterized by major changes, most notably the rise of armed terrorist groups, some of which have the support of rogue states. the united arab emirates must be more active in maintaining regional security through stronger partnerships. the government has a comprehensive approach to regional security that addresses the different dimensions of threats. key among those threats is interference in the affairs of the arab world, where countries like iran seek to undermine security efforts by spreading chaos, violence and sectarianism. the united arab emirates joined the coalition to support legitimacy in yemen to put an end to the houthi coup and to address iran’s nefarious interference and pointed to the differences between illegitimate houthi armed groups and the legitimate government of yemen. despite efforts to restore stability to yemen, houthi intransigence regarding peace initiatives has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the country, he said. in response, the coalition launched military operations to liberate hodeida from the grip of houthis and to achieve a strategic shift that enhances the prospects of a political solution to the crisis. operations in hodeida bear in mind the work of relief organizations, he assured. the united arab emirates is also making progress in the fight against al-qaida in the arabian peninsula. concerns over iran’s intentions are reflected in the decision of the united states to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with that country and re-impose sanctions. iran has not ceased its aggressive behavior in the region and has not abandoned initiatives to develop weapons of mass destruction. the second major challenge facing the region is the spread of extremist and terrorist groups and their exploitation of modern technology, he said. the situation is exacerbated by states who establish media outlets that incite hatred, he stressed, stating that his government is at the forefront of the fight against extremism. these efforts include participation in the g-5 sahel joint forces as part of efforts to eliminate extremism and terrorism wherever it exists, he said, adding that the forum for promoting peace in muslim societies is working to build an alliance of abrahamic religions and world philosophies. policies to counter supporters of extremism make no distinction between a group or a state, he said, noting that alongside close allies his government has taken sovereign measures towards qatar. a third challenge facing the region is the absence of a political solution to the palestinian issue. the people of palestine continue to wait for the international community to reach a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to end their suffering. the region also faces a deterioration of economic, social and humanitarian conditions, he said. at the core of the government’s foreign policy development efforts is the strengthening of economic opportunities and empowerment of women and youth in conflict-afflicted countries, he said, calling for the protection of yazidi and rohingya populations. he reiterated the vital role of united nations reform in supporting political processes, strengthening dialog and building conditions to maintain peace and security, adding that the international community must take a firm and consistent stance towards states that have hostile policies and violate international law. he reiterated his government’s demand for its legitimate right to sovereignty over the islands of great turb, lesser turb and abu musa, currently under iranian occupation."
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"73rd session of the united nations general assembly annual general debate statement by her excellency theresa may, prime minister, united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland new york, 26 september 2018 on behalf of the united kingdom let me begin by paying tribute to an outstanding leader of this united nations, who sadly passed away this summer. kofi annan was one of the great secretaries general, a tireless campaigner for peace and progress, and a champion of human rights and human dignity – whose influence will continue to be felt around the world for years to come. over the course of his lifetime he witnessed the extraordinary progress that we as a community of nations have made since this organization was founded. progress in which we have more than halved the number of people living in extreme poverty in this century alone. progress in which the number of people killed in conflicts has fallen by three quarters in just over three decades. and progress in which millions of our citizens lead healthier and longer lives and where – thanks to advances in human knowledge – in medicine, in science and in technology – we are presented with huge opportunities in the years ahead. yet today – many are concerned about whether this progress will continue, and fearful about what the future holds. for the end of the cold war did not – as many once believed – lead to the inevitable supremacy of open economies and liberal democracies co-operating on the global stage for the common good. today instead we face a loss of confidence in those very systems that have delivered so much. the belief in free markets has been challenged by the financial crisis of 2008, by the concerns of those feeling left behind by globalization, by the anxieties about the pace and scale of technological change and what that will mean for jobs, and by the unprecedented mass movements of people across borders with all the pressures that can bring. and after the military interventionism at the beginning of the century, people question the rationale – and indeed legitimacy – of the use of force and involving ourselves in crises and conflicts that are not ours. while at the same time being repelled by the slaughter in syria and our failure to end it. these doubts are entirely understandable. so too is the demand for leadership. so those of us who believe in inclusive societies and open economies have a duty to respond: to learn the lessons of the past, to meet people’s concerns with practical actions not beguiling illusions and to renew our confidence in the ideas and values that have done so much to benefit so many for so long. for be in no doubt, if we lack the confidence to step up, others will. in the last century – whether in the rise of fascism or the spread of communism – we have seen those on the extreme right and extreme left exploit people’s fears, stoke intolerance and racism, close down economies and societies and destroy the peace of nations. and today once more we see worrying trends in the rise of these movements in europe and beyond. we have seen what happens when countries slide into authoritarianism, slowly crushing the basic freedoms and rights of their citizens. we have seen what happens when corrupt oligarchies rob their nations of the wealth, resources and human capital that are so vital to unlocking a brighter future for their citizens. we have seen what happens when the natural patriotism which is a cornerstone of a healthy society is warped into aggressive nationalism, exploiting fear and uncertainty to promote identity politics at home and belligerent confrontation abroad, while breaking rules and undermining institutions. and we see this when states like russia flagrantly breach international norms – from the seizing of sovereign territory to the reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of britain by agents of the russian gru. we have to show there is a better way to meet the concerns of our people. that way lies in global cooperation between strong and accountable states based on open economies and inclusive societies. that ensures strong nation states provide the bonds that bring citizens together and ensures power remains accountable to those it is there to serve. that celebrates free markets and has the confidence to reform them when they need to work better. and that demonstrates that delivering for your citizens at home does not have to be at the expense of global cooperation and the values, rules and ideals that underpin this. indeed cooperation and competition are not mutually exclusive. only global cooperation based on a set of agreed rules can ensure competition is fair and does not succumb to protectionism, with its certain path to lost jobs and international confrontation. and it is only global co-operation which can harness legitimate selfinterest towards common goals, producing agreements on global challenges such as climate change, proliferation and increasing inclusive economic growth. we see this cooperation here today at this un, as we also saw it at the commonwealth heads of government meeting earlier this year. and here today – as chair-in-office of the commonwealth – i deliver a clear statement on behalf of the heads of government of its fifty-three equal and independent member states. we reaffirm our shared commitment to work together within a rules based international system to address shared global challenges and foster a fairer, more secure, more sustainable and more prosperous future. this commitment takes account of the special requirements of least developed countries, and of small and otherwise vulnerable economies, and it benefits all our citizens and the wider world. but it is not enough for us merely to make the case for cooperation. we need action, at home and in the community of nations, to show how our ideas and values can deliver practical benefits for all our people in all parts of the world. we must recognize the legitimacy of people’s concerns and act to build a global economy that works for everyone. we must invest in the patient work of building open societies in which everyone has a stake in the future. and we must act to uphold the international rules based system – and stand up for our values by protecting those who may suffer when it is violated. let me take each in turn. first, we must respond to those who feel that the global economy is not working for them. the pace of globalization that has left too many people behind. the fear that our children and grandchildren may lack the education and skills to secure the jobs of tomorrow. and the risk that technological change could become a source of inequality and division rather than the greatest opportunity in history. in the uk we are driving investment in industries of the future to create new jobs – from low carbon technologies to artificial intelligence. we are investing in education and skills so that workers are ready to make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead. and we are making sure people play by the rules – so that business and innovation is celebrated for creating jobs not demonized because of grievances over tax not paid or rights not respected. and while we strive to make our own economies work for all our people – we should do the same at a global level. in an increasingly global economy, it is not enough to ensure people play by the rules at home. we need global co-operation to set and enforce fair rules on trade, tax and the sharing of data. and these rules need to keep pace with the changing nature of trade and technology. so we need to give the world trade organization a broad, ambitious and urgent mandate to reform. this must address the areas where it is not functioning effectively; deal with issues that are not currently covered; and maintain trust in a system which is critical to preventing a return to the failed protectionism of the past. fair and respected rules are essential for business to flourish and drive growth. but recent history shows that this cannot be sustained without deeper partnerships between governments, business, international financial institutions and civil society to ensure that growth delivers for everyone. that is why i recently visited africa – along with british businesses – to promote trade and investment, and encourage a new partnership based on shared prosperity and shared security. it is why at this general assembly i co-hosted an event with prime minister trudeau, prime minister kagame and president akufo-addo calling for more support for investment and job creation for young people in the continent. it is why the united kingdom will maintain our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on official development assistance. and we will put our development budget at the heart of our international agenda, and do more to create jobs, improve skills and increase investment in emerging economies – in both our interests and theirs. for the best way of resisting protectionism is to ensure that this century is defined by open markets that really deliver for all our people. second, we must build countries, not only economies, that work for everyone – inclusive societies where every citizen has a stake in the future. these are the firm foundations on which strong and accountable nations are built. and history has consistently taught us that giving people a stake in society is the best way to ensure stability, security and economic growth. there is no one right way to do this. every country must choose its own path. but the basic tenets are common across the world. they include a government that is transparent and accountable. an independent judiciary to enforce the rule of law. free and fair elections and a free and open media. the freedom of expression, a right to redress and property rights that are reliably enforced. and equality, freedom of thought, opinion, religion and conscience – all found in the united nations universal declaration of human rights, signed 70 years ago. those of us who believe in these tenets must set an example in defending and strengthening them at home and abroad. that is why we must call out hate speech, anti-semitism, islamophobia and all forms of prejudice and discrimination against minorities wherever we find it. like many leaders, i suspect, i do not always enjoy reading what the media in my country writes about me. but i will defend their right to say it – for the independence of our media is one of my country’s greatest achievements. and it is the bedrock of our democracy. so too will i defend objectivity and impartiality in the face of those who treat truth as just another opinion to be manipulated. this challenge has only become more complex with the rise in social media, and online information. that is why we agreed at the g7 summit in june to step up our efforts to respond to disinformation. and why, together with our partners, and with tech companies, we are leading efforts to reclaim the internet from terrorists and others who would do us harm. and just as we must stand up for the values that we adhere to, so we must support countries and leaders who choose to take the often difficult steps towards a more inclusive society. the united kingdom will use all the levers at our disposal to do so. through our aid budget and commitment to the sustainable development goals we will not only protect the most vulnerable but also bolster states under threat and help others sustain their progress. through global campaigns we will help countries to end scourges such as modern slavery and sexual violence in conflict. and we will mobilize wider support through our alliances and membership of multilateral organizations – not only the un, but also international financial institutions, the g7, the g20 and nato. and just as there is no single recipe for an inclusive society, so there is no single model for balancing the democratic demands of our public with the imperative to co-operate internationally. the vote by the british people to leave the european union was not a rejection of multilateralism or international co-operation. it was a clear demand for decisions and accountability to lie closer to home. i believe the role of leadership in these circumstances is clear: it is delivering on the democratic wishes of our people and international cooperation working with allies and partners in pursuit of our shared values. third, we must have the will and confidence to act when the fundamental rules that we live by are broken. this is not about repeating the mistakes of the past by trying to impose democracy on other countries through regime change. but we should not allow those mistakes to prevent us from protecting people in the face of the worst violations of human rights and human dignity. we should not allow those mistakes to paralyze the international community when its long-established norms are violated. and we should not let our inability to prevent some of the worst conflicts today stop us from making every effort to ensure they do not happen again in the future. for if we stand back, we allow the world to become divided into spheres of influence in which the powerful dominate the weak, and in which legitimate grievances go unaddressed. this is not just a moral imperative. it is also a matter of self-interest. for when barbarous acts and aggression go unchecked – dictators and terrorists are emboldened. so, we must have the confidence to act. when the syrian regime used chemical weapons on its people again in april, it was britain together with france and america who took military action to degrade the syrian regime’s chemical weapons capability and deter their use. and when earlier this year, russia used a toxic nerve agent in a sickening attack on the streets of salisbury, the uk with our nato, eu and other allies took action, expelling over 150 russian intelligence officers: the largest collective expulsion ever. in burma, following the damning report of the united nations fact-finding mission, we should show the same confidence to hold accountable those responsible for the appalling atrocities repeatedly inflicted by the burmese military on the rohingya, shan and kachin peoples since 2011. similarly we should gather evidence of daesh’s crimes worldwide, so ensuring justice for their victims and deterring those who might conduct such crimes in the future. but accountability alone is not enough. we must do more collectively to prevent such atrocities in the first place, and address the causes of instability that can give rise to them. the united nations has a critical role to play. and it has a wide range of levers to do so from sanctions – which show the leaders of iran and north korea that they cannot act without consequence – to peacekeeping missions such as that in south sudan, which is helping to prevent suffering and the collapse of law and order. but to be able to draw effectively on these levers, the security council must find the political will to act in our collective interest. the un’s agencies must deliver the reforms that the secretary general has started – to become more agile, more transparent and better co-ordinated on the ground. and to support these reforms, we must also ensure proper funding is targeted specifically at those parts of the un that deliver results. 70 years ago the general assembly agreed the universal declaration of human rights. today we must renew the ideals and values on which that declaration was founded. in doing so, we must learn the lessons of the past and show through our actions how co-operation between strong and accountable states with open economies and inclusive societies can best deliver security and prosperity for all our people. as kofi annan said at the start of his second term as secretary general: “i have sought to turn an unflinching eye to the failures of our recent past, in order to assess more clearly what it will take for us to succeed in the future.” in that spirit, let us show unflinching resolve to renew the promise of freedom, opportunity and fairness. a promise which has delivered for more people, in more places than at any other period in our history. and let us ensure that promise can be fulfilled for our children and grandchildren – and for every generation to come. thank you.","theresa may, prime minister of the united kingdom, noted progress in the world, including the number of people in poverty halved and the fact that today millions lead healthier lives. yet, today, many are concerned whether this future will continue, especially as the cold war’s end has not led to liberal democracies for the common good. “we face a loss of confidence in those systems,” she said, adding that the belief in free markets was challenged by the financial crisis of 2008, as well as other issues such as the mass movement of people across borders. these doubts are understandable, as is the need for leadership, she noted, adding that “we have a duty to respond”. if world leaders lack the confidence to step up, others will instead. spotlighting fascism, she said the world has witnessed a rise of such movements and the results when countries slide into authoritarianism and oligarchs rule. the russian federation’s breaching of international norms is evidence of this, she said, noting the use of chemical weapons by agents of the gru [main directorate of the general staff of the armed forces of the russian federation]. the international community needs to show there is a better way, based on inclusive societies, she urged, stressing that delivering for citizens at home did not have to be at the expense of global cooperation. “it is only global cooperation that can harness legitimate self-interests,” she said. through the united nations there is a shared commitment within a rules-based international system and this commitment takes into account small vulnerable economies and benefits all citizens. however, “we need action to show how we can deliver and we must recognize the legitimacy of concerns. we must invest in building open societies and must stand up for our values for those who may suffer,” she said. outlining a series of priorities, she said that the international community must respond to those who think the global economy has left them behind, and must make the economy work for all people. fair rules on trade and tax are needed; this includes giving the world trade organization (wto) a mandate for reform. fair and respected rules can drive growth. second, she noted economies must be built that are inclusive and where every citizen has a stake. history has consistently demonstrated that giving everyone at stake ensures security. in addition, she called for an end to hate speech against minorities; and defended the media, a bedrock and a great achievement. this challenge is great because disinformation is great. there is also a need to reclaim the internet from terrorists and others who do harm. calling for a renewal of the ideals of the universal declaration of human rights, she added that open economies that are inclusive can deliver security and safety. citing kofi annan she said: “let us show unflinching resolve. let us ensure the promise fulfilled for every generation to come.”"
United Republic of Tanzania,"statement by his excellency ambassador dr. augustine mahiga (mp), minister for foreign affairs and east african cooperation of the united republic of tanzania, at the general debate of he seventy third session of the united nations general assembly, new york, 27 september 2018 your excellency, ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the general assembl ; your excellency antonio guterres, secretary-general of the united nations; your excellencies heads of state and government; distinguished delegates; salutations i wish to congratulate you madam president for your well-deserved election to preside over the work of this 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. your election to this prestigious position as the fourth woman to this post in the history of this organization and the first from latin america is not only a unique accolade to you but also a testimony bestowed on you by the member states of the organization. in this regard, tanzania pledges its full support to you and your entire bureau. i also wish to pay special tribute to your predecessor, h.e. miroslav lajcak, for his successful leadership and commitment to the general assembly during his presidency. we wish him well in his future endeavors. in the same manner, i commend mr. antonio gutteres, un secretary general for his tireless efforts in steering the work of our organization, especially in implementing the challenging reforms that are underway under his stewardship. 1 ferry accident in tanzania madam president; i am greatly hono red to address this assembly on behalf of my president h.e. dr. john pombe joseph magufuli who could not join his colleagues in this assembly following the tragic ferry accident which claimed the lives of more than 200 tanzanian and left many others wounded. we appreciate the support of the international communit during this difficult moment. may the souls of the departed rest in eternal peace. condolences madam president; before i proceed, let me express tanzania s condolences from my government to the united nations communit and the entire world for the demise of dr. kofi annan, an outstanding humanitarian and a defender and advocate of multilateralism. our thoughts and prayers are with his family, relatives and friends. may his soul rest in eternal peace, amen. theme: making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societie madam president; this year theme making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies is very captivating and timely in reinforcing global governance to enhance the implementation of agenda 2030 for sustainable development. this impetus from the united nations comes, as it does, as multilateralism is eroding and needs to be rescued with collective and determined efforts. today, we are living in a world where most societies are neither peaceful, equitable nor sustainable. the world is still facing many violent conflicts and wars resulting in massive loss of lives, the threat of terrorism, destruction of the environment, refugee influ es, displaced persons, and global migration, hunger and poverty persists in many parts of the world. addressing these challenges requires a collective visionary leadership and governance. 2 unfortunately, all these miseries are mainly man-made and can be prevented if we resolve to take collective measures. thus, continued and meaningful cooperation among member states is a prerequisite in addressing all challenges confronting the world. through this platform, we can accentuate the relevance of this body to all nations and the people. furthermore, we can shape global policies and norms to respond to different needs of diverse cultures and societies. thus, a call for the united nations to be relevant to all people is timely; and indeed, it is in accordance with united nations purposes and principles as enshrined in the charter. multilateralism madam president; it is in facing these global challenges that multilateralism at all levels of response and especially through the united nations and its institutions becomes essential to ensure peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. it is undeniable fact that every sovereign state in the international system seeks to maximize its national interests and the wellbeing of its citizens. however, acting alone and in isolation minimizes the potential for realizing desired optimal results for nations acting in isolation. globalization and the intricate web relations that have subsequently emerged globally renders a multilateral approach to issues of national, regional and international concern are essential and unavoidable. unfortunately, the world is, in recent times witnessing multilateral institutions and principles being put to test. for example, the world trade organization (wto), which has been the pillar and yardstick of rule based fair global trading system is being undermined. climate change and global warming which is already wrecking havoc to lives and propert in all regions regardless of national borders can only be addressed effectively through multilateral approaches. above all, it was the post second world war multilateral edifice and institutions which have given us the peace we witness today albeit its shortcomings. we should be seeking to improve the shortcomings in the multilateral system e have created for ourselves for a better world rather than walking away from it. madam preside t; tanzania is unreser edly committed to the multilateralism in pursuit of its national interests. it is also through unmitigated multilateralism, that we will be 3 able to address critical global challenges such as terrorism, extremism, radicalism, climate change, restrictive trade policies, trafficking in persons, drug abuse, pandemic diseases, absolute poverty, immigration dynamics and weapons of mass destruction, just to mention a few. we are encouraged by the united chorus from this general assembly in the defense of multilateralism and in defense of the purposes and principles of the united nations which bind all its members. diplomatic means to resolve conflicts madam president; we have seen diplomatic engagement working successfully to bring adversaries to a roundtable to address their differences peacefully. tanzania wishes to underscore the continuous use of diplomatic means and roundtable dialog to address conflicts between and among nations. it is in this regard, as a peaceful and stable countiy, tanzania has assisted and witnessed the value of brokering peace. tanzania welcomes the recent talks between the us and north korea on the korean nuclear deal which paved the way for a recent signing of an agreement between north korea and republic of korea. we hope this deal and others that have followed the same pattern will yield the anticipated positive outcomes sooner than late including the long outstanding humanitarian issues in the korean peninsula. these are some of good examples of successful outcomes following the diplomatic engagements around the world. all these efforts have confirmed the value of dialog in resolving and preventing conflicts. un reforms madam president; reforms are necessary for continuity and change. for the past few decades, this very assembly has continuously been discussing reforms of the united nations and its institutions to effectively respond to the current global economic, political, social and security dynamics. this is the way to make our organization alive and relevant. currently, the reforms are focusing on the united nations development system, management and peace and securit . my delegation strongly believes that the reforms will be objective and balanced. 4 tanzania supports the reforms of the united nations, especially the security council and reiterates the position of africa as contained in the ezulwini consensus and sirte declaration of which we abide with. in addition, tanzania urges the international communit to make the process transparent, inclusive and democratic. all countries, poor and rich must have equal participation and their voices and positions must be heard and taken seriously. after many years of almost stalemated negotiations on the security council reforms, it is necessary to move the process forward but in a manner that will preserve the interests and positions of all parties concerned in a transparent consultative manner. madam president; we ought to remind ourselves that the credibility of the united nations rests on a well-represented and responsive security council. the council is what it is today, and the reforms are not advancing well because of the eto. if we are to make meaningful reforms, we should first of all and foremost be bold enough to decide on the future use of the veto. in this respect, my delegation wishes to stress that issues relating to the veto, exp nsion of membership and categories should be addressed as a package and not in isolation. addressing poverty madam president; over the years and with support of the international community and development partners, tanzania has successfully implemented various national development plans which have significantly contributed to the reduction of poverty. furthermore, we are proud to have incorporated the sustainable development goals (sdgs) into our national development agenda in order to accelerate economic growth and eradicate poverty. drawing experiences from mdgs, it is apparent that implementation of the sdgs requires adequate, sustainable and predictable funding especially to least developed countries. thus, mobilization of long-term innovative public and private finance is key to the realization of the goals. tanzania has embarked on systematic legal and administrative reforms which have been constraining resource mobilization and accountability. the government has embarked on relentless fight against corruption and public service incompetence in order to increase accountability and transparency. the 5 government has undertaken stringent measures to fight drug and human trafficking, illicit trade in ivory and violent extremism. as expected, these measures have generated determined resistance from vested economic and criminal elements. this has necessitated the government to take appropriate countermeasures which have sometimes been misunderstood as restrictive. tanzania will continue to respect its constitution, the rule of law and enshrined freedom. despite the ongoing efforts on domestic resource mobilization, developing countries continue to experience a global systemic issue on tax regime and illicit financial flows which contributes to capital flight and deny these countries of their rightful income. we call upon the international community to double the efforts in dealing with these systemic issues through, among other things, establishing an intergovernmental ta body under the united nations to address tax competition and tax avoidance. this will in turn put at disposal more resources to developing countries to implement the sdgs. peace keeping operations madam. president; tanzania is among the top troop contributing countries to the un peacekeeping missions, and that we have contributed to the restoration of global peace and stabilit . the number of our troops serving in different missions currentl stands at 2,687 peacekeepers. despite these achievements, the participation of tanzania in peacekeeping operations has met some challenges including attacks and killings of our peace keepers. the december 2017 attack is the worst in the last 25 years of peacekeeping history. we thank the unsg and all member states that extended condolences to tanzania and the families, friends and relatives of the demised. our pain was relieved by many of you who stood with tanzania during that difficult moment. may the souls of the departed rest in eternal peace. amen! in view of support received from the united nations, we commend the secretar general for promptly forming a special investigation team which established the causes of the attack and actions to be taken to prevent such hostile and cowardly incidences in the future. we are also gratified that the recommendations of the investigation report will feature in the declaration of shared commitments on un peacekeeping operations which tanzania supports. tanzania looks forward to the implementation of the recommendations. 6 situation of refugees madam president; i wish to remind this august assembly of the historical role played by tanzania in hosting and providing sanctuary to refugees for decades from central and southern africa. we have done that out of humanity and in line with the internationally agreed principles of admitting asylum seekers and protecting refugees. currently, we are hosting more than 330,000 refugees, mainly from burundi and drc. o er the years, and decades of hosting refugees, tanzania has provided local integration as a durable solution to many refugees than any other country in the world in excess of 150,000 refugees. apart from providing sanctuar to refugees, we have also been involved in resol ing regional conflicts in the great lakes region that have the potential to increase refugee influ es. in addition, tanzania has also assisted the voluntary repatriation of more than 46,000 burundian refugees as as of september 2018. the repatriation exercise was conducted transparently and inclusively in collaboration with the burundian authorities, unhcr and other relevant development partners. some misguided burundi exiles have criticized the exercise as involuntar when actually there has been bottlenecks and constraints in implementing the tripartite agreement due to lack of resources and mixed progress in the political and security situation in burundi. it is in this regard, tanzania requests the international community to facilitate and support the on-going voluntary repatriation of the remaining burundian refugees. it is equally important to present a realistic assessment of the evolving political and security situation in burundi to permit the refugees to make informed and objective decision on return to various parts of the country. political situation in the democratic republic of congo madam president; the people of drc continue to face challenges of peace, securit and stabilit . the country has continuously been destabilized by warring factions and war lords that have created havoc leading to political instability in some parts of the country. this situation has not only denied drc the opportunity to develop its country and people, but has also undermined and threatened regional peace and security. however, the current developments in resolving that impasse is very refreshing taking into account the government s commitment to hold the long-awaited 7 general elections later this year. the stability in drc does not only contribute to address the refugee problem, but also accelerates regional trade, investment, and economic prosperity opportunities. in this regard, tanzania encourages the international community to e tend both logistical and financial support to drc so that it can successfully complete the necessary preparations for, and holding of, the elections. to this end, it is necessary to continue with the un stabilization mission under monusco and fib in the eastern part of the country until elections are concluded. us embargoes on cuba madam president; in 2015, many world leaders who gathered here welcomed the historic and momentous decision taken by the united states of america and the republic of cuba to restore diplomatic relations. to most of us, it was the beginning of a harmonious co-existence with high hopes and expectations. however, with time, we feel that minimum efforts have been made to meet such hopes and e pectations by ultimately lifting the embargoes which have condemned the people of cuba for many years. we hope that, through the power of reason and the er diplomatic means that led to the reestablishment of their ties, there will be the total removal of those embargoes against cuba, and that a new dawn of cooperation will follow. non-self-governing territories western sahara madam president; the issue of self-determination for western sahara has entered a new direction with morocco re-joining the african union, where it is a member of the peace and security council. there is a renewed opportunit for the united nations and the un special envoy of the secretar -general to work with the newly established au troika mechanism of the african union to address the issue of western sahara. tanzania supports that initiative. 8 the question of palestine madam president; tanzania reiterates its position in resolving the conflict between israel and palestine by supporting the two-state solution. we understand that palestine has the right to enjoy its independence and peace as is israel in accordance with the united nations charter. it is our belief that it is within the creative and resourceful ability of israel and the determination of the palestinian people to reach a peaceful solution that will permit israel and palestine to co-exist in peace and security. conclusion madam president; as i conclude, i reiterate tanzania s commitment to the principles and purposes of the united nations and to multilateralism. tanzania stands ready all the time to participate constructively in the search for peaceful solutions to conflicts and contributing to the un mandates for conflict prevention and peacekeeping. above all, we look to this organization to continue championing the implementation for the sustainable development goals to support tanzania’s own efforts to achieve sustainable development goals as it heads to a middle income status through indu strialization. may god bless us all; and god bless the united nations 1 thank you for our kind attention. 9","augustine phillip mahiga, minister for foreign affairs and east african cooperation of the united republic of tanzania, said that at present most societies are not peaceful, equitable or sustainable. the world is still facing many violent conflicts, resulting in massive loss of life, terrorism threats, refugees and migration. hunger and poverty persist. addressing these challenges requires leadership. unfortunately, these miseries are mainly man-made and can be prevented through collective measures. highlighting the power of multilateralism, he noted that the united nations can ensure peaceful, equitable, and sustainable societies. unfortunately, multilateral institutions are being put to the test. for example, the world trade organization is being undermined. in addition, climate change and global warming is wreaking havoc, he said, stressing the need to rectify the shortcomings in the multilateral system. the united republic of tanzania is unreservedly committed to multilateralism — the path to address critical global challenges such as terrorism, extremism, radicalism, climate change, trafficking, drugs, pandemics, immigration dynamics and poverty, he said. diplomatic engagement is a way to address differences peacefully and in this regard, the united republic of tanzania has assisted and witnessed the value of brokering peace. noting that the assembly has discussed united nations reform for decades, he stressed the need for the “almost stalemated negotiations” of the security council to move forward, but in a consultative manner that will preserve the positions of all parties concerned. turning to the situation of refugees, he noted the historical role played by the united republic of tanzania in providing sanctuary for decades to refugee from central and southern africa, something done out of humanity and internationally agreed principles. currently the country is hosting 330,000 refugees mainly from burundi and the democratic republic of the congo. in addition, it has also been involved in resolving regional conflicts in the great lakes region and has assisted in the voluntary repatriation of more than 46,000 burundian refugees, in collaboration with burundian authorities, the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) and other development partners. in this regard, he asked the international community to facilitate and support the ongoing voluntary repatriation of the remaining burundian refugees. addressing another issue in the region, he noted the political situation in the democratic republic of congo, which has been continuously destabilized by warring factions. this situation has denied that country the opportunity to develop, and it threatens regional peace. he encouraged the international community to extend logistical and financial support to the democratic republic of the congo so that it can successfully complete the necessary preparations for elections. moving on to other parts of the world, he hoped for the total removal of the embargo against cuba and a renewed opportunity to resolve issues in western sahara and in palestine."
United States of America,"73rd session of the united nations general assembly annual general debate address by the president of the united states of america h. e. mr. donald trump new york, 25 september 2018 madam president, mr. secretary-general, world leaders, ambassadors, and distinguished delegates: one year ago, i stood before you for the first time in this grand hall. i addressed the threats facing our world, and i presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for all of humanity. today, i stand before the united nations general assembly to share the extraordinary progress we’ve made. in less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country. america’s — so true. (laughter.) didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s okay. (laughter and applause.) america’s economy is booming like never before. since my election, we’ve added $10 trillion in wealth. the stock market is at an all-time high in history, and jobless claims are at a 50-year low. african american, hispanic american, and asian american unemployment have all achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. we’ve added more than 4 million new jobs, including half a million manufacturing jobs. we have passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in american history. we’ve started the construction of a major border wall, and we have greatly strengthened border security. we have secured record funding for our military — $700 billion this year, and $716 billion next year. our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before. in other words, the united states is stronger, safer, and a richer country than it was when i assumed office less than two years ago. we are standing up for america and for the american people. and we are also standing up for the world. this is great news for our citizens and for peace-loving people everywhere. we believe that when nations respect the rights of their neighbors, and defend the interests of their people, they can better work together to secure the blessings of safety, prosperity, and peace. each of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture, a rich history, and a people bound together by ties of memory, tradition, and the values that make our homelands like nowhere else on earth. that is why america will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control, and domination. i honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs, and traditions. the united states will not tell you how to live or work or worship. we only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return. from warsaw to brussels, to tokyo to singapore, it has been my highest honor to represent the united states abroad. i have forged close relationships and friendships and strong partnerships with the leaders of many nations in this room, and our approach has already yielded incredible change. with support from many countries here today, we have engaged with north korea to replace the specter of conflict with a bold and new push for peace. in june, i traveled to singapore to meet face to face with north korea’s leader, chairman kim jong un. we had highly productive conversations and meetings, and we agreed that it was in both countries’ interest to pursue the denuclearization of the korean peninsula. since that meeting, we have already seen a number of encouraging measures that few could have imagined only a short time ago. the missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction. nuclear testing has stopped. some military facilities are already being dismantled. our hostages have been released. and as promised, the remains of our fallen heroes are being returned home to lay at rest in american soil. i would like to thank chairman kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done. the sanctions will stay in place until denuclearization occurs. i also want to thank the many member states who helped us reach this moment — a moment that is actually far greater than people would understand; far greater — but for also their support and the critical support that we will all need going forward. a special thanks to president moon of south korea, prime minister abe of japan, and president xi of china. in the middle east, our new approach is also yielding great strides and very historic change. following my trip to saudi arabia last year, the gulf countries opened a new center to target terrorist financing. they are enforcing new sanctions, working with us to identify and track terrorist networks, and taking more responsibility for fighting terrorism and extremism in their own region. the uae, saudi arabia, and qatar have pledged billions of dollars to aid the people of syria and yemen. and they are pursuing multiple avenues to ending yemen’s horrible, horrific civil war. ultimately, it is up to the nations of the region to decide what kind of future they want for themselves and their children. for that reason, the united states is working with the gulf cooperation council, jordan, and egypt to establish a regional strategic alliance so that middle eastern nations can advance prosperity, stability, and security across their home region. thanks to the united states military and our partnership with many of your nations, i am pleased to report that the bloodthirsty killers known as isis have been driven out from the territory they once held in iraq and syria. we will continue to work with friends and allies to deny radical islamic terrorists any funding, territory or support, or any means of infiltrating our borders. the ongoing tragedy in syria is heartbreaking. our shared goals must be the de-escalation of military conflict, along with a political solution that honors the will of the syrian people. in this vein, we urge the united nations-led peace process be reinvigorated. but, rest assured, the united states will respond if chemical weapons are deployed by the assad regime. i commend the people of jordan and other neighboring countries for hosting refugees from this very brutal civil war. as we see in jordan, the most compassionate policy is to place refugees as close to their homes as possible to ease their eventual return to be part of the rebuilding process. this approach also stretches finite resources to help far more people, increasing the impact of every dollar spent. every solution to the humanitarian crisis in syria must also include a strategy to address the brutal regime that has fueled and financed it: the corrupt dictatorship in iran. iran’s leaders sow chaos, death, and destruction. they do not respect their neighbors or borders, or the sovereign rights of nations. instead, iran’s leaders plunder the nation’s resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the middle east and far beyond. the iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from iran’s treasury, seized valuable portions of the economy, and looted the people’s religious endowments, all to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war. not good. iran’s neighbors have paid a heavy toll for the region’s [regime’s] agenda of aggression and expansion. that is why so many countries in the middle east strongly supported my decision to withdraw the united states from the horrible 2015 iran nuclear deal and re-impose nuclear sanctions. the iran deal was a windfall for iran’s leaders. in the years since the deal was reached, iran’s military budget grew nearly 40 percent. the dictatorship used the funds to build nuclear-capable missiles, increase internal repression, finance terrorism, and fund havoc and slaughter in syria and yemen. the united states has launched a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime the funds it needs to advance its bloody agenda. last month, we began re-imposing hard-hitting nuclear sanctions that had been lifted under the iran deal. additional sanctions will resume november 5th, and more will follow. and we’re working with countries that import iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially. we cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons. we cannot allow a regime that chants “death to america,” and that threatens israel with annihilation, to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on earth. just can’t do it. we ask all nations to isolate iran’s regime as long as its aggression continues. and we ask all nations to support iran’s people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and righteous destiny. this year, we also took another significant step forward in the middle east. in recognition of every sovereign state to determine its own capital, i moved the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem. the united states is committed to a future of peace and stability in the region, including peace between the israelis and the palestinians. that aim is advanced, not harmed, by acknowledging the obvious facts. america’s policy of principled realism means we will not be held hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies, and so-called experts who have been proven wrong over the years, time and time again. this is true not only in matters of peace, but in matters of prosperity. we believe that trade must be fair and reciprocal. the united states will not be taken advantage of any longer. for decades, the united states opened its economy — the largest, by far, on earth — with few conditions. we allowed foreign goods from all over the world to flow freely across our borders. yet, other countries did not grant us fair and reciprocal access to their markets in return. even worse, some countries abused their openness to dump their products, subsidize their goods, target our industries, and manipulate their currencies to gain unfair advantage over our country. as a result, our trade deficit ballooned to nearly $800 billion a year. for this reason, we are systematically renegotiating broken and bad trade deals. last month, we announced a groundbreaking u.s.-mexico trade agreement. and just yesterday, i stood with president moon to announce the successful completion of the brand new u.s.-korea trade deal. and this is just the beginning. many nations in this hall will agree that the world trading system is in dire need of change. for example, countries were admitted to the world trade organization that violate every single principle on which the organization is based. while the united states and many other nations play by the rules, these countries use government-run industrial planning and state-owned enterprises to rig the system in their favor. they engage in relentless product dumping, forced technology transfer, and the theft of intellectual property. the united states lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs, nearly a quarter of all steel jobs, and 60,000 factories after china joined the wto. and we have racked up $13 trillion in trade deficits over the last two decades. but those days are over. we will no longer tolerate such abuse. we will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated, and our wealth to be plundered and transferred. america will never apologize for protecting its citizens. the united states has just announced tariffs on another $200 billion in chinese-made goods for a total, so far, of $250 billion. i have great respect and affection for my friend, president xi, but i have made clear our trade imbalance is just not acceptable. china’s market distortions and the way they deal cannot be tolerated. as my administration has demonstrated, america will always act in our national interest. i spoke before this body last year and warned that the u.n. human rights council had become a grave embarrassment to this institution, shielding egregious human rights abusers while bashing america and its many friends. our ambassador to the united nations, nikki haley, laid out a clear agenda for reform, but despite reported and repeated warnings, no action at all was taken. so the united states took the only responsible course: we withdrew from the human rights council, and we will not return until real reform is enacted. for similar reasons, the united states will provide no support in recognition to the international criminal court. as far as america is concerned, the icc has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy, and no authority. the icc claims near-universal jurisdiction over the citizens of every country, violating all principles of justice, fairness, and due process. we will never surrender america’s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy. america is governed by americans. we reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism. around the world, responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance, but also from other, new forms of coercion and domination. in america, we believe strongly in energy security for ourselves and for our allies. we have become the largest energy producer anywhere on the face of the earth. the united states stands ready to export our abundant, affordable supply of oil, clean coal, and natural gas. opec and opec nations, are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and i don’t like it. nobody should like it. we defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. not good. we want them to stop raising prices, we want them to start lowering prices, and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on. we are not going to put up with it — these horrible prices — much longer. reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation. that is why we congratulate european states, such as poland, for leading the construction of a baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on russia to meet their energy needs. germany will become totally dependent on russian energy if it does not immediately change course. here in the western hemisphere, we are committed to maintaining our independence from the encroachment of expansionist foreign powers. it has been the formal policy of our country since president monroe that we reject the interference of foreign nations in this hemisphere and in our own affairs. the united states has recently strengthened our laws to better screen foreign investments in our country for national security threats, and we welcome cooperation with countries in this region and around the world that wish to do the same. you need to do it for your own protection. the united states is also working with partners in latin america to confront threats to sovereignty from uncontrolled migration. tolerance for human struggling and human smuggling and trafficking is not humane. it’s a horrible thing that’s going on, at levels that nobody has ever seen before. it’s very, very cruel. illegal immigration funds criminal networks, ruthless gangs, and the flow of deadly drugs. illegal immigration exploits vulnerable populations, hurts hardworking citizens, and has produced a vicious cycle of crime, violence, and poverty. only by upholding national borders, destroying criminal gangs, can we break this cycle and establish a real foundation for prosperity. we recognize the right of every nation in this room to set its own immigration policy in accordance with its national interests, just as we ask other countries to respect our own right to do the same — which we are doing. that is one reason the united states will not participate in the new global compact on migration. migration should not be governed by an international body unaccountable to our own citizens. ultimately, the only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to help people build more hopeful futures in their home countries. make their countries great again. currently, we are witnessing a human tragedy, as an example, in venezuela. more than 2 million people have fled the anguish inflicted by the socialist maduro regime and its cuban sponsors. not long ago, venezuela was one of the richest countries on earth. today, socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty. virtually everywhere socialism or communism has been tried, it has produced suffering, corruption, and decay. socialism’s thirst for power leads to expansion, incursion, and oppression. all nations of the world should resist socialism and the misery that it brings to everyone. in that spirit, we ask the nations gathered here to join us in calling for the restoration of democracy in venezuela. today, we are announcing additional sanctions against the repressive regime, targeting maduro’s inner circle and close advisors. we are grateful for all the work the united nations does around the world to help people build better lives for themselves and their families. the united states is the world’s largest giver in the world, by far, of foreign aid. but few give anything to us. that is why we are taking a hard look at u.s. foreign assistance. that will be headed up by secretary of state mike pompeo. we will examine what is working, what is not working, and whether the countries who receive our dollars and our protection also have our interests at heart. moving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends. and we expect other countries to pay their fair share for the cost of their defense. the united states is committed to making the united nations more effective and accountable. i have said many times that the united nations has unlimited potential. as part of our reform effort, i have told our negotiators that the united states will not pay more than 25 percent of the u.n. peacekeeping budget. this will encourage other countries to step up, get involved, and also share in this very large burden. and we are working to shift more of our funding from assessed contributions to voluntary so that we can target american resources to the programs with the best record of success. only when each of us does our part and contributes our share can we realize the u.n.’s highest aspirations. we must pursue peace without fear, hope without despair, and security without apology. looking around this hall where so much history has transpired, we think of the many before us who have come here to address the challenges of their nations and of their times. and our thoughts turn to the same question that ran through all their speeches and resolutions, through every word and every hope. it is the question of what kind of world will we leave for our children and what kind of nations they will inherit. the dreams that fill this hall today are as diverse as the people who have stood at this podium, and as varied as the countries represented right here in this body are. it really is something. it really is great, great history. there is india, a free society over a billion people, successfully lifting countless millions out of poverty and into the middle class. there is saudi arabia, where king salman and the crown prince are pursuing bold new reforms. there is israel, proudly celebrating its 70th anniversary as a thriving democracy in the holy land. in poland, a great people are standing up for their independence, their security, and their sovereignty. many countries are pursuing their own unique visions, building their own hopeful futures, and chasing their own wonderful dreams of destiny, of legacy, and of a home. the whole world is richer, humanity is better, because of this beautiful constellation of nations, each very special, each very unique, and each shining brightly in its part of the world. in each one, we see awesome promise of a people bound together by a shared past and working toward a common future. as for americans, we know what kind of future we want for ourselves. we know what kind of a nation america must always be. in america, we believe in the majesty of freedom and the dignity of the individual. we believe in self-government and the rule of law. and we prize the culture that sustains our liberty -– a culture built on strong families, deep faith, and fierce independence. we celebrate our heroes, we treasure our traditions, and above all, we love our country. inside everyone in this great chamber today, and everyone listening all around the globe, there is the heart of a patriot that feels the same powerful love for your nation, the same intense loyalty to your homeland. the passion that burns in the hearts of patriots and the souls of nations has inspired reform and revolution, sacrifice and selflessness, scientific breakthroughs, and magnificent works of art. our task is not to erase it, but to embrace it. to build with it. to draw on its ancient wisdom. and to find within it the will to make our nations greater, our regions safer, and the world better. to unleash this incredible potential in our people, we must defend the foundations that make it all possible. sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured, or peace has ever prospered. and so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all. when we do, we will find new avenues for cooperation unfolding before us. we will find new passion for peacemaking rising within us. we will find new purpose, new resolve, and new spirit flourishing all around us, and making this a more beautiful world in which to live. so together, let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. let us choose peace and freedom over domination and defeat. and let us come here to this place to stand for our people and their nations, forever strong, forever sovereign, forever just, and forever thankful for the grace and the goodness and the glory of god. thank you. god bless you. and god bless the nations of the world. thank you very much. thank you.","donald j. trump, president of the united states, underscored the progress made by his country since his election, stating that it is now stronger, safer and richer. “we are standing up for america and the american people, and we are also standing up for the world,” he said. when nations respect the rights of their neighbors and defend the interests of their people, they can better work together to secure the blessings of prosperity and peace. the united states will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control and domination, he said. it will not tell others how to live or work or worship; it only asks that its sovereignty be honored in return. highlighting the united states engagement with the democratic people’s republic of korea, he thanked its leader kim jong-un for his courage and for the steps taken towards a denuclearized korean peninsula. however, much work remains to be done, he said, emphasizing that sanctions will remain until denuclearization occurs. in the middle east, the new american approach is making great strides, with gulf nations assuming greater responsibility in the fight against terrorism and extremism. ultimately, it is up to the nations of the region to decide the kind of future they want. for that reason, the united states is working with the gulf cooperation council, jordan and egypt to set up a regional strategic alliance to advance prosperity and stability. turning to the defeat of islamic state in iraq and the levant (isil/da’esh) in iraq and syria, he said the international community’s shared goal in syria must be a de-escalation of the military conflict alongside a political solution that honors the will of the syrian people. the united nations-led peace process must be reinvigorated, but the united states will respond if chemical weapons are deployed by the assad regime. commending jordan and others for hosting syrian refugees, he emphasized that the most compassionate policy is to place refugees as close to their homes as possible. every solution to the humanitarian crisis in syria must include a strategy to address the brutal and corrupt regime in iran that has fuelled and financed it, he continued. the leaders of iran are sowing chaos, death and destruction, disrespecting their neighbors’ borders and sovereignty, and plundering their country’s resources. many countries in the middle east supported the decision of the united states to withdraw from the joint comprehensive plan of action and to reimpose targeted nuclear sanctions. “we cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons,” he stated, calling for the iranian regime to be isolated. recalling the relocation of the united states embassy in israel to jerusalem, he said peace between israelis and palestinians has been advanced, not harmed, by acknowledging the obvious facts. “america’s policy of principled realism means we will not be held hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies and so-called experts who have been proven wrong over the years, time and time again,” he said. on other global issues, he said trade must be fair and reciprocal. no longer will the united states be taken advantage of by those who abuse its openness by dumping exports, subsidizing industries and manipulating their currencies. many member states will agree that the world trading system is in dire need of change, he said, affirming that the united states trade imbalance with china cannot be tolerated. on human rights, he said the united states will not return to the human rights council until real reforms are enacted. nor will the united states support or recognize the international criminal court, which has no jurisdiction, legitimacy or authority. he called on the member states of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to lower oil prices and spend more on defense, and warned that germany will depend entirely on russian energy if it fails to change course. reaffirming the rejection by the united states of outside interference in the western hemisphere, he underscored its cooperation with latin american partners on migration. however, the united states will not participate in the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. migration should not be governed by an international body unaccountable to citizens. the only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to help people build more hopeful futures in their own countries — to “make their countries great again”. describing the situation in venezuela as a human tragedy, he urged member states to call for the restoration of democracy in that country. the united states is reviewing its foreign assistance program to see what works, what does not work and whether recipient countries have the interests of the united states at heart. on the united nations, he affirmed his commitment to make the organization more effective and accountable. it has unlimited potential, he said, but stressed the united states will not pay more than 25 per cent of its peacekeeping budget. the world is a better place thanks to a constellation of nations, each of them special, unique and shining brightly in their part of the world, he said, adding that sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicles where freedom, democracy and peace have survived and prospered. “together let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity and pride. let us choose peace and freedom over domination and defeat and let us come here […] to stand for our people and their nations — forever strong, forever sovereign, forever just and forever thankful for the grace and the goodness and the glory of god.”"
Uruguay,,"tabaré vázquez, president of uruguay, said the criteria and methodology used by the organization for economic cooperation and development to qualify countries’ development based on their per capita income imposes “severe injustice”. pointing out that uruguay has been considered a high-income country since 2013 and will no longer qualify for official development aid, he stressed that although growth and development are linked, they are different. while uruguay has enjoyed economic growth that has lifted thousands of its citizens out of poverty, structural gaps persist, he stated, adding that “development in transition” is not a random concept but rather an apt description of the situation of countries like his — on the path to development and still in need of cooperation to accompany them. “it’s paradoxical. it seems as if we are punishing those who do things well. i hope the criteria will be reviewed soon,” he said. invoking the irrevocable responsibility to fight for the uruguayan people, he said his country has implemented strict control policies for tobacco consumption and measures to prevent non-communicable diseases. still there is much to be done to combat tobacco, which kills more than 7 million people every year. he called on all countries to put in place the measures set forth by the world health organization to combat this scourge. he reaffirmed his country’s historic commitment to an international system that is more participatory, fair, balanced and multipolar. “today we see the world almost as if it were an asylum run by the insane,” he said. in such a turbulent international context, the international community must reaffirm its values and principles, he stated, calling upon those present today to finance and modernize the global system. in that spirit, his country would put forward its candidacy for the human rights council for the years 2019 to 2021. “uruguay’s vocation is pacifist, based on solidarity and committed to world peace and security,” he said. the environment and the consequences of climate change constitute a priority for the entire world, he stated, adding that it’s “everyone’s fight, the fight for life”. he urged the most powerful world leaders to respect the international agreement to protect the environment and called for proactive measures to protect all — especially the poorest — from the consequences of climate change. reiterating his commitment to the paris agreement, he recalled that “agreements are signed to be implemented”."
Uzbekistan,"1 address of the permanent representative of uzbekistan during the general debates of the 73rd session of the unga madam president! let me express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to address from this high podium today. i would like to congratulate her excellency maría fernanda espinosa garcés with her election as the president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. distinguished delegates! today the republic of uzbekistan is on an important stage of radical and dynamic transformations. their goal – strengthening and further developing a democratic lawgoverned state with an open and socially-oriented market economy and vibrant civil society, in which the main value are rights, freedom and legal interests of individual. at the initiative of president of the republic of uzbekistan shavkat mirziyoyev we adopted a five-year strategy of actions, aimed at fundamental changes in the economy, state governance, legal and social spheres, in the area of security, in ensuring interethnic and inter-confessional peace and harmony. a principle “the people should not serve the state bodies, rather the state bodies should serve the people” has become a cornerstone of the main program of democratic reforms. elevating the role of parliament and political parties, increasing accountability of the executive branch and transparency in its activity, strengthening institutes of public control and development of the civil society have become practical embodiment of the constitutional principle “the people are the sole-source of state power”. we are taking significant steps on streamlining the national system of protection of human rights and freedom, strengthening independence of the judicial system. the use of child and forced labor has been ceased. the recommendations of the un human rights council, treaty bodies, un high commissioner on human rights and special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief are being coherently implemented. 2 we’ve also carried out large scale measures on liberalization of economy, creating conditions for free entrepreneurship, ensuring inviolability of private property, improving investment climate. free convertibility of national currency has been introduced, access to bank credits has been expanded, and tax and custom reforms have been carried out. according to the world bank report – doing business 2018, uzbekistan was among the ten leading countries that created favorable conditions for doing business. as a result, today uzbekistan has acquired an image of a comprehensively renewed, open and dynamically developing country. the chosen course of resolute reforms has become irreversible and it enjoys the broad support of the people of the country. madam president! today we are witnessing an unprecedented process of formation of a new alignment of power on global and regional levels. rethinking the principles of international politics and economy, which until recently seemed to be unshakable, is underway. the world is becoming less predictable and unstable. the strength of effectiveness of multilateral institutions and mechanisms, designed to ensure international security, has been put under test. in this regard, it is crucial to strengthen the central role of the united nations in international relations, especially in supporting of the three pillars of the organization, i.e. efforts on ensuring peace, security and sustainable development of countries and regions as well as the protection of human rights. uzbekistan supports steps taken by the leadership of the united nations on streamlining the governing system of the organization as well as it calls for gradual reforming its organs, including the security council taking into account today’s realities and challenges. in addition, we are ready to actively participate in un efforts on promoting comprehensive peace, stability and development on the basis of respecting for human rights and freedom, democratization and the rule of law. in this regard, uzbekistan has for the first time nominated its candidacy to the united nations human rights council for the period of 2021-2023. we sincerely hope that our achievements in the area of human rights will become a solid basis for the support of uzbekistan’s candidacy by the un member-states. 3 we also count on the support of un member-states of the initiative of the president of uzbekistan to develop and adopt a un convention “on the rights of youth” and a general assembly resolution entitled “enlightenment and religious tolerance”. these documents would facilitate effectively countering threats of terrorism and ideology of radicalism by solving vital social-economic problems of the youth, providing them with an access to quality education and enlightenment in the spirit of tolerance, humanism and openness. uzbekistan has already begun advancing these initiatives. in june, 2018 jointly with foreign partners we held an international conference “on the role of youth in confronting religious extremism and terrorism”. at the end of the forum the participants adopted the samarkand declaration. in 2018 the world community celebrates the 70th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights. in this regard, the president of uzbekistan has signed a decree on the program of events dedicated to this occasion. we have adopted a special state program for promoting the essence and significance of this first universal document on human rights as well as for streamlining domestic legislation on human rights, law enforcement practice, and for uzbekistan’s accession to new international treaties. uzbekistan has also made a voluntary contribution to the budget of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in the amount of 100 000 us dollars. currently, we are also taking an initiative of convening an asian international forum on human rights on november 22-23, 2018 as the final event of our targeted practical work. the forum will take place in samarkand city, which, as per a definition of unesco, is a “crossroad” of many world cultures. madam president, central asia remains as a main foreign policy priority of uzbekistan. today the situation in this region differs from the one we had not long ago. thanks to joint efforts of the countries of the region, within a short period of time in central asia we’ve created a fundamentally new political atmosphere, raised the level of political trust, strengthened traditionally friendly and good neighborly relations among ourselves. 4 the important outcome of all of this work is the significant progress in resolving such acute issues as demarcation of borders, management of the water resources, and joint use of transport communications. one should note that these very issues have not only remained unresolved for an extended period of time but were also sources of regional tension. the agreements with neighboring countries allowed to open dozens of checkpoints on the borders of uzbekistan and liberalized the visa regime. uzbekistan’s trade turnover with the states of the region increased by 20% in 2017, and by 50% - during the first six months of the current year. in the near future, at the initiative of uzbekistan, we are planning to convene a regional economic forum, which should serve as a permanently functioning platform for representatives of business-community to discuss regional projects in the field of trade-economic, investment and innovative cooperation. the first consultative meeting of the heads of state of the central asian countries held last march in astana, became the bright symbol of a new era of regional cooperation. the next forum will take place in march, 2019 in tashkent. most importantly – we are now more convinced that we are united not only by our one past, but by our common future. the high level of regional interaction in central asia receives broad international support. in this regard, i would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our partners and friends who have recently rendered assistance in the preparation and adoption of a historically important resolution of the un general assembly entitled “strengthening regional and international cooperation in ensuring peace, stability and sustainable development in the central asian region”. no doubt that this un document acknowledges the formation of central asia as a single consolidated region, the countries of which (and i would like to put special emphasis on this) are capable by joint efforts to solve common regional problems, to ensure prosperity, well-being and worthy future for their population of 70 million. the sustainable development of central asia stipulates maintaining ecological equilibrium in the region which directly depends on the mitigation of the consequences of the drying up of the aral sea. for the past several years uzbekistan has implemented a number of large scale projects in the aral sea zone. 5 uzbekistan has initiated the establishment of the multi-partner human security trust fund for the aral sea region, which was supported by the united nations. president of uzbekistan shavkat mirziyoyev during his address at the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly last year and at the summit of the international fund for saving the aral sea, held on august 24 this year in turkmenistan, again reminded about this initiative. the establishment under the auspices of the united nations of this multi-partner human security trust fund for the aral sea region is an attempt to highlight major risks that pose threats to the most vulnerable population, and also opens a new level of dialog aimed at comprehensive and human based solutions which focus on the real needs of people, taking into account existing risks and challenges. we hope for an overall support of the united nations of this initiative taken by uzbekistan. madam president, when we speak about central asia, we can’t help but to mention afghanistan – the country which we consider a historical part of the single cultural-civilizational space of our region. stable afghanistan is a prerequisite for the sustainable development of central asia as a whole. recently uzbekistan has notably expanded its bilateral relations with afghanistan, actively joined multilateral efforts on resolving the afghan problem and is making real contribution to restoring the country’s economy as well as to developing close trade-economic and transport-communication ties. in march of the current year in tashkent we convened the conference on afghanistan. as president of uzbekistan shavkat mirziyoyev stated during his address at the conference, and i quote, “we are ready, at any stage of the peace process, to create all necessary conditions for organizing on the territory of uzbekistan direct negotiations between the government of afghanistan and the taliban movement” (end of quote). the unanimous adoption of the tashkent declaration has become the main outcome of the forum. it reinforced a firm consensus on the regional and global levels on the necessity of the earliest launch of the direct negotiations between the government of afghanistan and the taliban movement without any preliminary conditions. 6 we are convinced that the readiness of the confronting parties to mutual negotiations in the name of vital interests of the multinational afghan people would become a solid basis for advancing peace process in this country. madam president, in uzbekistan, we fully understand that the success of the large scale program of the democratic transformations, outlined in the current strategy of actions, as well as of our foreign policy initiatives, aimed at facilitating international peace and stability, will to a large extent depend on the support of our friends and partners, and the international community as a whole. therefore, uzbekistan is open for a broad international dialog. we are sincerely interested in uzbekistan’s further integration into global political and economic ties, developing constructive and mutually beneficial cooperation with all interested countries. thank you for your attention.","bakhtiyor ibragimov (uzbekistan) gave an overview of his country’s democratic reforms - including its five‑year strategy of actions - with steps being taken to strengthen human rights and judicial independence, improve state governance and liberalize the economy. those reforms are irreversible and enjoy broad popular support. in international relations, however, the world is becoming increasingly unstable, testing the effectiveness of multilateral institutions. it is therefore crucial to strengthen the central role of the united nations, including through security council reforms. noting uzbekistan’s bid to sit on the human rights council in 2021‑2023, he asked member states to support its president’s initiative to develop a united nations convention on the rights of youth and a general assembly resolution titled “enlightenment and religious tolerance”. he went on to say that the situation in central asia today is better than it was not too long ago, with a higher level of trust between states and stronger good‑neighborly relations. significant progress has been made in such areas as border demarcation and water management. in addition, a regional economic forum is being planned for the near future and, in march 2019, heads of state will meet again in a consultative forum in tashkent. “we are now more convinced that we are united not only by our past, but by our common future,” he said, adding that uzbekistan is proposing a draft general assembly resolution on sustainable tourism in central asia. a stable afghanistan – a historical part of the region’s cultural‑civilizational space - is a prerequisite for sustainable development in central asia as a whole, he continued, emphasizing his government’s readiness to create the conditions for organizing direct talks in uzbekistan between the government of afghanistan and the taliban. the unanimous adoption of the tashkent declaration on afghanistan in march reinforced the regional and global consensus on the need to launch those talks as soon as possible without preconditions. negotiations between the government of afghanistan and the taliban, in the interest of the multinational afghan people, would be a solid basis for advancing afghanistan’s peace process, he stated."
Vanuatu,,"charlot salwai tabimasmas, prime minister of vanuatu, highlighted the many achievements of the united nations in the past seven decades, noting that extreme poverty had been reduced by half and “more girls are in school than ever before”. women, particularly in rural areas, are contributing to the global economy and the health of mothers and children have improved. however, overshadowing those achievements are the united nations failures, including the inability of the security council to take decisive action on syria. calling on that organ to demonstrate leadership in preserving global peace, he welcomed the reform efforts of the secretary‑general. turning to human rights, he noted that every country must have a resilient national human rights system to achieve meaningful success in development. the pacific region has committed to strengthening its climate resilience. as the earth rapidly approached a point of no return as evidenced by heatwaves, extreme droughts and the frequency of weather phenomena, it was crucial to take concerted action. according to the world risk report of the united nations university, vanuatu is the country most at risk in the world in terms of exposure to natural disasters, which is putting tens of thousands of its citizens’ lives at risk. if greenhouse gas emissions remain at the present level, there will be increasing costs to deal with, he cautioned. developed counties had committed to mobilize $100 billion for climate finance for vulnerable countries by 2020, he continued. yet, how this will be achieved remains unclear. calling for the adoption of a specific road map for the collection of those funds, he stressed, “climate change will not wait”. in addition, more flexible access to climate funding was crucial. the pacific region cannot afford to see the paris agreement relegated to the archives of the united nations. that represented a real danger for the survival of their future generations. calling on the parties to the agreement to step up their determination, he noted that as the largest oceanic continent, the pacific islands are focusing on sustainable policies for the sound management and conservation of the oceans. welcoming proposals to support those regional efforts, he highlighted the work of the pacific islands forum. while 750 million people from more than 80 former colonies had achieved political independence over the past seven decades, the aspirations of millions of others were still denied, he noted. commending the work of the organization’s special political and decolonization committee (fourth committee), he said that decolonization must remain on the united nations agenda. new caledonia is in the process of determining its own destiny, he said, calling on the international community to support their right to participate fully in the upcoming referendum which must take place in a free and fair manner. further, the human rights council must investigate the human rights abuses in west papua. ensuring national sustainable development was a priority for his country, he said, adding that vanuatu’s sustainable development goals are people‑focused and flexible so that it could achieve a balance between the three dimensions. eradication of poverty is essential. nonetheless, the country cannot shoulder that responsibility alone. the difficulty of that task is amplified because vanuatu gets exposed to natural disasters in increasing number, including recent volcanic activity in one of the islands that led to evacuations. expressing gratitude to development partners who helped the country at this time, he noted that vanuatu would graduate from least developed status in 2020, and asked them to continue supporting the country."
Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of),"statement by the president of the bolivarian republic of venezuela nicolas maduro during the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly un general assembly hall – new york, united states, september 26th, 2018 president of the bolivarian republic of venezuela, nicolas maduro ambassadors, heads of delegations of the countries members of the united nations organization, president-elect of the general assembly, mrs. maria fernanda espinoza, may i extend to you the congratulations on behalf of the delegation of the bolivarian republic of venezuela – our government – on assuming the presidency of the 73rd session of the general assembly as the first latin-american woman to be president of a general assembly session. in this occasion, we have been invited to work and address an important and vital issue, entitled as follows: “making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. so we are here to make the united nations relevant for all people. this is precisely a noble purpose up to what the united nations system has to build in light of the 21st century: a century of great opportunities and certainly a century that will make the difference regarding the human liberation processes – political liberation, peoples’ liberation – that, sooner or later, will impact significantly on the future of the united nations organization. the current united nations organization was born at the end of second world war (1945). during the 20th century, its configuration expressed the conflicts and forms of actions by the bipolar world of the postwar years and, after the fall of the soviet union in the 90s, we moved to a unipolar world. the correlation of forces in the world, regarding the world system, has always influenced the united nations organization, directly. however, in order to be relevant – according to the purpose of this 73rd general assembly – this organization has to express the wishes, the way of being, the culture, the political thinking, the strength and the hopes of the majorities in the world. that is why venezuela is here today; to say its truth; i bring the truth of a combative, heroic and revolutionary world; i bring the voice of a homeland that, throughout history, has refused to surrender to injustice, to the empires of the past – slaver and colonialist – and the empires of today – equally slaver and neocolonialist. i bring the voice of a heroic people that arose from the heroic resistance of the aborigines, from the indigenous peoples that for centuries resisted the domination by colonial empires. i bring the voice of the people having the honor of being the great liberator simon bolivar’s home, the most important leader of a generation of liberators of the americas, who accomplished, 200 years ago, the heroic feat of founding a continent, a region, a dream: the independent republics of this world region. venezuela is a historic people which is both a home and a school of republican values; a home and a school of rebelliousness; a home and a school of dignity and values such as equality; such is our obstinate homeland that for centuries has searched its independence and sovereignty. i speak on their behalf before this scenario which has witnessed the most evil and embarrassing attacks in the last years; for our country is a harassed and attacked country. yesterday, in this same place, the president of the united states of north america once again attacked the noble people of venezuela and supported, as he said, the doctrine founded by the empire of the united states 200 years ago, which determined their interventionist role, their intended role of judge, party and police of the world: the monroe doctrine. yes, the president of the most powerful imperial nation, the united states of north america, was in this same place, supporting james monroe’s doctrine, who, at that time, said “america for americans”, meaning that the rest of america had to belong to them as the backyard for the interests of washington elite groups that already conducted the configuration of that nation as a former colony of the british empire. he supported the monroe doctrine. and you may be wondering about the reason for such fierce attack by the american power, expressed at all levels by president donald trump. it is a historic conflict as we have said to the world many times, as our people well knows. it is the conflict between the interventionist imperial, neocolonialist monroe doctrine against the historic, independence, republican, simon bolivar’s doctrine, of rebelliousness, dignity, justice, liberty and equality. it is an old conflict; an old contradiction due to an imperial doctrine aimed at dominating our region. during the 19th century, it was aimed at dominating our region only; however, in the 20th century, it was intended to dominate the world and in the 21st century it tries to continue governing, conducting, blackmailing and arranging the world as if it were their property. in our region, it is a 200-year contradiction between the republican libertarian flags which, in the 19th century – the time of simon bolivar and the liberators – advocated for a world of equilibrium and respect and the pro imperialist and interventionist flags that promoted the domination of the region by an elite group that already had the control of the power in washington. it is an old conflict we know very well. today, venezuela is a victim of a permanent aggression in the economic, political, diplomatic and media fields by those who govern the united states of north america and support the monroe doctrine to justify the ideological, political and diplomatic aggression against our beloved homeland. our reason for being here is the reason. why is venezuela being politically, economically and diplomatically attacked? first of all, venezuela has built an autonomous project of democratic revolution, social vindication, and construction of a self and new model of society, which is based on the historical roots of our nation, on the identity of our country and on the own culture of our latin-american region. for 20 years, they have been intended to stop the course of our history, the development of a revolutionary project that arose from the own struggle root of our people and region. secondly – and perhaps more understandable- for global geopolitical reasons, venezuela is the nation with the largest oil reserve of the world, internationally certified. venezuela as founder of opec, venezuela a country with 100 years of oil production, discovered and certified internationally the largest oil richness of the world; venezuela has also significant natural and mining richness. today, according to international standards, our country is certifying the potentially biggest gold reserve of the world. the world must know that currently, apart from being the biggest international oil reserve, venezuela is certifying, under international standards, the biggest gold reserve of the world and the fourth gas reserve of the world as well. the significant natural resources, important geopolitical, geo-economic and geo-strategic position have lead the oligarchies of the continent and those who dominate from washington, to consider dominating and controlling the political power in venezuela. in the present, venezuela is victim of a permanent aggression. in the economic sphere, during the last two years, venezuela has been subjected to a set of illegal unilateral measures of economic persecution and blockade; we have been restrained from using the international currency, –the dollar- via positions of use of dominion by the authorities of the us department of treasury. currently, venezuela cannot negotiate any international transaction in dollars. did the world know that venezuela is persecuted from an economic, commercial and monetary point of view? today, venezuela is target of a set of illegal and unilateral mechanisms of economic sanctions. yesterday, the president of the united states announced, precisely on this same platform, new and alleged economic and financial sanctions against our country in the sanctuary of the law and international legality. did the united nations system know that the unilateral sanctions, using the dominion, the status of the currency and the financial persecution are considered illegal from the standpoint of international law? venezuela is subjected to a permanent media aggression as well; attempts to forge a file have been made to justify an international intervention. we know that it is an intended international intervention, a military intervention to control our country. at global level, a file has been forged through the media against our country to pretend a humanitarian crisis that uses the united nations concepts to justify a coalition of countries led by the government of the united states, and their satellite governments in latin america, to get its hands on our country. a migration crisis, that goes without saying, has been forged by several means, aimed at diverting the attention from the real migration crises in the world that show the disadvantages of the southern countries. the migratory crisis in central america, mexico, and latin america arising due to the announcement of a retaining wall against our peoples, a dividing wall against them. nobody wants to talk about this situation. a double-standard treatment has been intended over the real status of the caribbean and latin american migrants who have been persecuted along the border with mexico; they have been separated from their families, their kids have been kidnapped; and no response is given about this issue or about the serious migration crisis caused by the destruction in libya by nato and the war against syria, resulting in the migration of thousands of african and middle-east brothers. it is an issue that is intentionally masked. a global media campaign about an alleged migratory crisis in venezuela has been deployed to justify a humanitarian intervention, as announced for years. it is a plan similar to the weapon-of mass-destruction plan used in iraq; it is the same plan that justified the intervention in other countries, this time under a form of a great brutal psychological warfare campaign. today, venezuela is also the victim of a diplomatic nature aggression. yesterday – dear brothers and sisters of the governments of the world – we witnessed direct threats to cut aid, to withdraw aid or blockade aid from the international support and aid systems for the governments and peoples of the world on the need of it by the president of the united states. we have listened to the statements issued by several governments demanding better mechanisms to access financing, to access development to which our peoples are entitled to. yesterday, the president of the united states, in this very platform, threatened the governments of the world to submit to its designs, to its orders and to cooperate with its policies in the united nations system, or he would act accordingly. venezuela has been attacked with a fierce diplomatic offensive at all of the united nations system bodies, supported by satellite kneeled governments blackening the honor of the peoples that they are called to represent. venezuela has been subjected to permanent political aggression. on september 8th, the new york times published an article evidencing the participation of officials of the white house and the government of the united states, in meetings to bring about a military coup and cause a change of government, a change of regime in venezuela. the investigation published by the new york times – replicated by the times magazine, the washington post and the world press – simply confirmed the conspiracy, the permanent aggression by factors of the government of the united states against a constitutional and strengthened democracy; a democracy supported by the people, such as the venezuelan democracy. we had already denounced in due course, the attempts of violence against the constitution, the attempts of disturbances and military coups against the constitutional and revolutionary government over which i preside in the bolivarian republic of venezuela, by popular will and popular vote. after announcing and publishing the failed attempts of disturbances and military violence – the new york times published details on how us officials in colombia, supported by the colombian government and colombian institutions, met and offered their encouragement and support for this attempted change of regime. should the united nations system, should the union – i am addressing my latin american and caribbean brothers – should latin america and the caribbean accept these methods that so hurt our region in the entire 20th century? how many military interventions? how many coup d’états? how many dictatorships were imposed during the long and dark 20th century in latin america and the caribbean, and who did it favor? did it favor the peoples? what interests did they represent? the interests of the transnational companies, the unpopular interests; long dictatorships, like augusto pinochet’s in chile, were faced by our peoples due to the stubbornness of the american elites and the monroe doctrine to deny the right earned by ourselves to govern our countries the way we need, and build specific economic, political and cultural systems of the region. that is why i come here, to bring the truth of a fighting people; venezuela has been targeted by a seemingly never-ending political and media campaign. that is why we bring our homeland’s truth to this honorable un general assembly; after the failure published and announced by the new york times of these illegal, unconstitutional and criminal attempts of regime change, after the democratic presidential election, last may 20th, when i, nicolas maduro moros, obtained 68% of the popular votes through free elections – the 24th election in 19 years, of which 22 have been won by the revolutionary forces of the bolivarian republic of venezuela, at different levels of approval, against the opposition forces of our country; after the failure of the attempted military coups, candidacies and electoral tactics supported by washington, with the huge electoral victory attained by the people, last august 4th, i was a victim of a terrorist attack with drones that tried to kill me in a military event on one of the main avenues in caracas. if it had been executed as planned, it would have been a massacre, an assassination of the institutional, political and military high command of our nation, venezuela. on august 4th, the perpetrators, the terrorists, those who attacked me with drones – this is the first attack with drones known in the world history of terrorist violence – were captured by the security bodies and state police agencies. the 28 perpetrators were captured thanks to different investigation procedures. they are convicted and sentenced. as i informed to different governments of the world, all the investigations about that terrorist attack indicate that it was prepared, financed and planned in the territory of united states of america. i have informed to the government of united states – by diplomatic means – the name, the responsibility and the evidences of the intellectual perpetrators, financers and planners of this serious terrorist attack. according to investigations, this attempt and the actual perpetrators – as they have admitted – were trained and prepared for months in colombian territory under the protection and support of colombian authorities; and according to the latest investigations and captures – as unveiled to the media – the perpetrators mentioned some of the diplomatic members of the government of chile, colombia and mexico who would help them to escape after the terrorist attack. i would like to ask the united nations system to appoint a special delegate of the secretariat of the united nations to conduct an independent investigation internationally about the implications and responsibilities of this terrorist attack perpetrated in our country. venezuela is opened; the doors of our country and our judicial system are opened in order to determine the direct responsibilities of this aggression, the most serious in the political history of our country for its implications. they tried to provoke a chaos in our homeland, they tried to rip the state’s head off to justify a domestic struggle, a domestic violence and justify the activation of mechanisms beyond the united nations multilateral system, of a military intervention as occurred in other countries in the past. officially, venezuela proposes -ambassador, minister for foreign relations – to conduct an independent international investigation to determine the truth about these events. i have expressed to the government of united states – who has denied its participation in the preparation and execution of these attempts -, that it will be great if they heed my call to include high-level fbi professionals and scientists in this investigation to clarify and help the venezuelan justice to find the truth. when i arrived in new york this the afternoon, i heard that some journalists had asked president donald trump if he was willing to meet with maduro (that’s how people call me) with nicolas maduro, president of venezuela. apparently, president donald trump in one of his today’s interventions said that if it helps venezuela, he was willing to do so. well, i ratify on this platform, that despite the great historical differences, ideological and social differences – since i am a worker, a bus driver, a man of the people, i am not a rich man, i am not a millionaire – despite all the differences deemed as enormous, the president of venezuela, nicolas maduro moros, is willing to shake hands with the u.s president. i am willing to sit and talk about the bilateral differences and the matters of our region. i believe so. venezuela is a friendly country. venezuelans do not hate the united states; on the contrary, we appreciate the united states, their culture, their arts, their society. we differ from the imperial concepts that took over the political power in washington since the foundation of that nation. in 1826, our liberator simon bolivar said prophetically: “the united states appear to be destined by providence to plague america with hunger and misery in the name of liberty”. it was a prophetic vision. it was hard to see at early times the future in the 20th century. do we have differences president donald trump? of course we do. but differences lead to dialog. those who are different are called to put their good will and words on the table. president donald trump said he is worried about venezuela, that he wants to help venezuela. well, i am willing to talk, with an open agenda about the topics that the united states government wants to discuss, with humility, frankness and honesty. as president of the nonaligned movement, venezuela raises the flags of dialog among civilizations. as president of the non-aligned movement, venezuela permanently promotes and practices the political and international dialog, the solution of the international conflicts through the dialog, the understanding and the pacific uses of politics and not by force. venezuela is significantly experienced in bodies such as opec, to manage situations of divergence and build consensus and agreements. recently, in algeria, we attended the meeting of the opec monitoring committee. it was an extraordinary meeting with the representatives of the monitoring committee, since we are part of it, and the representatives of 24 states with the greatest oil reserves and producers of the world. and despite the cultural, political, geostrategic and geopolitical differences, we reached an agreement, a single voice to continue stabilizing the oil market at fair, reasonable and stable prices. we believe in the political dialog as a way to find solutions and solve conflicts. they have tried to demonize the bolivarian revolution through an unprecedented brutal campaign. first, against commander hugo chavez frias, founder of our revolution and eternal commander in the heart of venezuelans, and then against this humble man who is standing here, bringing the voice of a people that supports its revolution and democratically supports its actions. therefore, i reaffirm the desire for international and national political dialog. i know that governments represented in this room are interested in reaching peace with sovereignty, independence and justice in venezuela. i welcome all those from africa, europe, asia, latin america who wish to help respecting the country’s sovereignty, without interfering in venezuela’s internal affairs so that they can support us, join us in a process of sovereign dialog for venezuela’s peace, democracy, justice, future and prosperity; a noble nation which deserves peace, a future and the best. we bring good news from a country that has not given up and shall not do so. good news from a nation that is consolidating its democracy; good news from a country that is building its own social model, its own welfare state by means of new formulas to protect its elders, its pensioners, its children, its young people, its women, the neediest sectors, its working class. we also bring good news regarding the efforts for an economic recovery; in fact, i activated, in august, an economic recovery, growth and prosperity program which is succeeding in placing the bases of a new economy, not dependent on oil revenues, a diversified economy, of sustainable growth and prosperity building, heading towards a new kind of social model. we believe in a different world; our generation witnessed the so-called bipolar world, the socalled cold war which some apparently want to bring back again through attacks against china, russia and modest countries like venezuela. however, provoking a fight against countries like russia and china is a contradiction of what a humanitarian international policy should be, meaning one which recognizes the emergence of new poles of power and the need to build a multipolar world. venezuela is a country which advocates for and is committed to the construction of a pluripolar and multicentric world, where all the different regions (africa, latin america, the caribbean, asia, europe, and north america) can live together in balance and peace, respecting our cultures, religions, idiosyncrasies, identities and economic and political models. there is not a unique economic model; we must not allow the imposition of a single cultural model, a single political model; they intend to impose a single thought for humanity. i say no. we vindicate the cultural, religious and political diversity of humanity of this world. therefore, in the non-aligned movement, we advocate for the emergence of such a world of justice. we assume and declare our solidarity with the arab people of palestine; justice shall arrive to palestine so that their historic territories, established in 1967 by this united nations organization, are respected. we carry with us the flag of the palestinian people. we support the un call for an end to the infamous and criminal 50-year-blockade against the cuban people. we have had enough of anachronistic methods that they intend to continue imposing against the cuban people, and now against other peoples like venezuela. so we raise our two hands to vote on the united nations resolution, which in the next few days will be carried out to reject the blockade and economic-financial persecution against cuba, and demand its immediate lifting, in a world to be built, in a world to be made. 200 years ago, our region was plagued by colonies, slavery and injustice. 100 years ago, as peoples, we struggled for freedom. today, in the 21st century, the moment has come, the opportunity has come. undoubtedly, in the bolivarian republic of venezuela, with simon bolivar’s revolutionary ideas, with the example and legacy of commander hugo chavez – whose voice still resonates here in this room demanding justice and justice for the world, demanding the cessation of the imperial practices of threats, coercion and extortion against peoples – we can say that in 20 years of revolution, the last 3 have been the hardest years: years of harassment, aggressions and attacks. today, on september 26th, 2018, i can say that we have faced political, media, diplomatic, economic and financial persecutions, but i also can say that today venezuela is stronger than ever. we have learnt how to resist and draw the strength from our historic roots to stand up, victorious and willing to continue advancing in the construction of our own social model, which it is the socialist revolution of the 21st century; we say it to the four winds, it is a new revolution, of independence, dignity and justice. today, we are stronger than ever. yes, i was a witness, we were witnesses two days ago of the tribute to nelson mandela; speaking about mandela is speaking about rebellion. many people have tried to create a wrong picture of mandela like a dump person, somebody who did not fight. mandela is synonym of rebellion against injustice, bravery, courage and the challenge to the oppressors. we are followers of nelson mandela’s legacy and the great african leaders who have raised the struggle for equality, justice and against slavery, racism and colonialism in all its forms. we saw the tribute to nelson mandela and we thought how much this world has changed. just 30 years ago mandela was considered a terrorist by the united states congress and the north american governments. just a few years ago nelson mandela was still on the list of sanctioned people. it may sound familiar to you: nelson mandela, the terrorist, the sanctioned, the persecuted, and the abandoned. the world has changed a lot since then. currently, nelson mandela is a flag that we embrace with love, with conviction. he is a symbol of what it is possible to do if the rebellion, the struggle, and justice are able to conquer the noble hearts and minds of the peoples. i trust in the future of humanity, in the destiny of my country, in the common future of this community represented here in the united nations organization, and i must say, after having resisted coup d’état attempts, terrorist attacks, that: i trust the human being, the future of humanity. venezuela says to the united nations: we trust in the noble ideals of the venezuelan people that do not give up and will not surrender. thank you very much, dear compatriots of the world. count on venezuela for the great causes of the future of this organization, and the future of a multipolar world! good evening to all of you, thank you.","nicolás maduro moros, president of venezuela, said he is part of a revolutionary people and a land that will never come to its knees. paying tribute to a proud people living in the country where simon bolivar was born and whence he “freed a continent” from colonialists and enslavement, he cited venezuela’s history of heroic resistance and support of indigenous peoples. decrying shameful actions against his country, he said that president donald trump used his united nations address to invoke a doctrine that imposed the rule of the united states from 200 years ago, that intervention is possible and that he can be judge and policeman of the world. describing the monroe doctrine as an imperialist expression of ownership of the americas, he said “our people rose against it because we wanted freedom and equality”, but that the united states wants to continue giving orders to the world in the twenty-first century as it did in the preceding one. stating that venezuela is regarded as having the largest oil reserves in the world, the fourth largest gas reserves and may have the largest gold reserves, he described them as areas of geopolitical interest for “oligarchs in washington” who want to control venezuela. saying venezuela has been subjected to illegal actions and economic persecution and cannot use the united states dollar in any international transactions, he denounced president trump’s mention of possible further sanctions “in this sanctuary of international law”. venezuela is also being attacked constantly in the media to justify intervention, he said, citing a recent new york times article on how to bring about regime change. regardless, his nation has been able to prevent coups, violence and military offensives. referring to similar concerns, he cited examples of united states intervention in his country and others, including the invention of a “migration crisis” in mexico and the nato bombing of libya, which in fact has led to a real forced migration crisis in africa. providing examples of further interference in venezuela, he asked how many coup d’états and dictatorships had been imposed on latin america, blaming the united states who believed “that we could not govern ourselves as we saw fit”. stating that a 4 august terrorist drone assassination attempt against him in caracas was prepared and funded from the territory of the united states, he requested a special united nations rapporteur to carry out an independent investigation. yet despite vast differences, he said he is willing to reach his hand out to president trump to discuss regional matters bilaterally. venezuela is peaceful and friendly and appreciates the culture, art and social life of the united states, but it is against the “imperialists in washington”. domestically, he pointed to a program reestablishing a new economy not solely based on oil money, but one that is sustainable. the international community must build a multipolar world, as there is not one single economic model to impose on anyone. declaring solidarity with the palestinian people and calling for the immediate end of the blockade of cuba, he said: “we have a world to build”, stating that “venezuela is stronger than ever” and aims to create its own twenty-first century socialist model. paying tribute to the nelson mandela peace summit, he cited the south african leader as a man once known as a terrorist who is now a “symbol of what can be done if you are strong enough to rebel and struggle for justice”."
Viet Nam,"please check aeainst delivery statement by h.e. nguyen xuan phuc prime minister of the socialist republic of viet nam at the general debate of the 73™ un general assembly for a world of peace, equality and sustainable development (new york, 27 september 2018) your excellency madame maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the 73''^ session ofthe united nations general assembly, your excellency mr. antonio guterres, secretary-general of the united nations, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor to deliver this statement at the general debate of the 73""^^ session of the united nations general assembly under the theme of: '""''making the united nations relevant to all people: globalleadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies"". i would like to congratulate madam garces on your election as the president of the 73*^^ session of the united nations general assembly. i do believe that under your leadership, the session shall be a great success. may i also express my appreciation for the very important initiatives that secretary-general guterres has championed since taking office. on behalfof the government and people of viet nam, allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the general assembly for the minute of silence in memory of the late president of the socialist republic of viet nam tran dai quang who recently passed away. madam president, today, mankind has yet to forget the scourge of the two world wars of the 20^ century. however, since the birth ofthe united nations in 1945, world wars have become a thing of the past. the foundations of peace on our planet has continued to be reinforced, thanks to the efforts of the united nations - the largest multilateral organization, where most countries assemble. over the last 70 years, the united nations has played an enormous role, exerting tireless effort to preserve peace, prevent conflicts and wars, and realize the purposes and principles as codified in the united nations charter. we have seen significant achievements in recent years in global cooperation and development, ranging from the convention on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, to the reforms of the united nations, to the realization of the 2015 millennium development goals (mdgs) and the adoption and implementation of the 2030 agenda. the united nations has also been vital in the work to address global issues: poverty reduction, protection of women and children, promotion of human rights, improvement of healthcare, culture and education, preservation of the environment, and response to climate change. today the united nations has truly become a symbol of global solidarity, the embodiment ofhumanity and progress, and where our aspiration to strive for a world ofpeace, prosperity and equality, are realized. 2. viet nam has been a companion to the united nations and contributed to the noble goals pursued by the organization over the last 70 years. we are a staunch supporter of the central role of the united nations in the multilateral international system, and have actively joined in efforts to realize the fundamental cooperation pillars of the united nations: the maintenance of global peace and security, development cooperation, and the protection and promotion ofhuman rights. once a poor, under-developed, food-deficit country, viet nam has recorded average annual gdp growth of over 6% over the last 20 years, to become among the world's largest food exporters. since 2010, we have become a middle-income developing country and the living standards ofnearly 100 million of our citizens have improved dramatically. by actively engaging in international integration, viet nam enjoys free trading relations with nearly 60 major countries and partners in the world as a result of its membership of 16 free trade agreements (ftas), some of which are in the final stage of negotiations. most recently, we successfully hosted the 2017 apec year, the 132""^^ inter-parliamentary union general assembly, the 2018 world economic forum on asean, the 6^^ greater mekong sub-region cooperation summit, and are working towards the 2025 vision for the asean community, which aims to strengthen asean centrality in the evolving regional architecture. viet nam has also taken the initiative and taken part in many important un mechanisms, contributing responsibly in many different areas. viet nam is also making greater efforts to promote justice and sustainable development, foster equality and support for disadvantaged groups, protect the environment, and ensure rights for all citizens, while upholding the spirit of dialog and cooperation in the area of human rights. we always attach importance to preserving cultural and natural heritages and national identity, and are one of the few countries having accomplished multiple 2015 millennium development goals ahead of schedule, particularly on poverty reduction. it is our consistent policy to uphold the united nations charter and the fundamental principles of international law in the settlement of international disputes through peaceful means, including in the south china sea, which should be addressed on the basis of the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos) and the safeguard of maritime security and safety and freedom of navigation and over-flight. cooperation and assistance from the international community, including the united nations, has been extremely valuable to viet nam's achievements in sustainable development, international integration and poverty reduction. on this occasion, on behalf of the vietnamese government and people, i would like to express my sincere gratitude to the united nations, and ail countries and international organizations who have lent their active and effective assistance to viet nam. madam president, 3. our planet is experiencing a rapid evolution, propelled by the scientific and technological breakthroughs in the fourth industrial revolution, as well as the irreversible globalization. this opens up a range of new opportunities to guide mankind into a new era of economic growth never seen before in the history of our civilization, thus further bolstering the global main streams of peace, cooperation and development. yet the world is also faced with new, immense challenges. world peace has yet to be guaranteed. the situation on the korean peninsula has seen new progress. in the middle east, africa and elsewhere, conflicts or the threat of conflict are extant still, and immigration remains a pressing matter for many coimtries. power politics, the use or threat of force, and the rise of unilateral measures continue to be threats to international peace and stability. injustice and inequality remain in many parts of the world. risks and instabilities remain in global development. the impacts of climate change and environmental pollution are widespread. poverty is still a major challenge with nearly 750 million still living in extreme poverty. among them are many children suffering from hunger and deprivation, without access to healthcare or proper education. no single nation, regardless of their might or wealth, can singlehandedly address these enormous global challenges. they require the common efforts and collaboration of all nations. i would like to suggest that a concept of ""dual responsibility"" be universally upheld. each nation shall take additional responsibility for addressing global issues; and each individual shall take additional responsibility as a global citizen. against this backdrop, i share secretary-general guterres' view that the role of the united nations has become all the more important in the creation of new foundations to more effectively address global challenges. we must continue highlighting the role of the united nations, and join hands for a world of peace, equality and sustainable development. in this process, it is my hope that major powers and developed countries shall, by taking meaningful actions, play an exemplary role in maintaining peace and fostering development. the united nations general assembly should be the heart of cooperation among countries and peoples for peace, equality and sustainable development. we support lifting the unilateral embargo on cuba, so that this nation may exercise its freedom to participate equitably and fairly in economic and trading relations in accordance with international law. 4. peace, freedom and prosperity have always been the desire and aspiration of all peoples. in the age of the fourth industrial revolution, mankind's progress is measured not only by the feats of technological advancement, but peace and prosperity first and foremost; and even the smallest opportunity for peace must be cherished and nurtured. from our long struggle for freedom and independence, viet nam understands profoundly the value of peace, equality, self-determination, the right to the pursuit of happiness, and the democratic values extolled by the united nations charter. the voice of small nations and the aspiration of the disadvantaged need to be respected, heard, and shared. this is the foundation for sustainable and inclusive development, one that leaves no one behind. this is the foundation of social stability, to guarantee the rights and harness the creativity ofevery person. today, it is vital that the united nations engage in strong and comprehensive reforms, improving its effectiveness, democracy and transparency to better fulfill its indispensable role in leading efforts to address global challenges. as the secretary general had quoted in his opening remarks the words of the esteemed, late secretary general kofi annan: ' we can master our destiny it only if we face it together. and that, my friends, is why we have the united nations.' that is also the reason why, immediately after the establishment of the vietnamese state on september 2""^ 1945, in january 1946, the beloved president ho chi minh of the vietnamese people submitted a request for un membership. i ask you now: what do we want the un to be? in answering this question, we must applaud the reform proposals that secretary-general guterres have brought forward, particularly on the repositioning of the united nations development system. i propose that the un strengthen cooperation with the various regions, particularly the un - asean high-level cooperation mechanism, highlighting the un more within asean, and asean more, within the un. 5. viet nam takes pride in being an active member of the united nations. ours is a foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development, multilateralization and diversification of foreign relations, and active and engaged international integration. with this policy, we hope to make greater contributions to the creation of multilateral mechanisms and fulfillment of the common responsibilities of the international community. for viet nam, we have dispatched a level-2 field hospital to the un peacekeeping mission in south sudan. viet nam has submitted our candidacy for non-permanent membership of the united nations security council for the 2020 - 2021 term. i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the 53 countries of the asia-pacific group for endorsing viet nam as the sole candidate of the group, and to many others for your extensive support so far for our candidature. at this most prestigious forum, on behalf of the vietnamese government and people, i would like to call for, and very much hope to receive, the support of all member states. viet nam is committed to be an active and responsible member of the international community and the united nations. ladies and gentlemen, we have every reason to believe that, given our global partnership, solidarity and high level of commitment, the united nations' sustainable development goals and 2030 agenda shall triumph, living up to the aspirations of all mankind: for a world of peace, equality and sustainable development. may the 73 session of the united nations general assembly be a resounding a success. thank youfor your kind attention! 4","nguyen xuan phuc, prime minister of viet nam, thanked the general assembly for the minute of silence in memory of tran dai quang, former president of vietnam, who recently passed away. noting significant achievements in recent years thanks to global cooperation and development, such as the adoption of the convention on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, united nations reforms, millennium development goals and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, he said the united nations has become a true symbol of global solidarity. viet nam staunchly supports its central role in maintaining global peace and security, protecting and promoting human rights, and fostering development cooperation. once a poor, underdeveloped country, viet nam has experienced average annual gdp growth of over 6 per cent in the last 20 years, transforming it into one of the world’s largest food exporters and dramatically improving living standards for nearly 100 million citizens. as a party to 16 free trade agreements, viet nam enjoys free trade relations with almost 60 major countries and partners worldwide. it hosted the 2018 world economic forum on the association of southeast asian nations (asean) and it is working towards the 2025 vision for the asean community. viet nam is also striving to promote justice and sustainable development, foster equality and support for disadvantaged groups, protect the environment, and uphold human rights for all, he said, citing its focus on preserving cultural heritage and national identity. it is one of the few countries that has achieved several millennium targets ahead of schedule. international disputes should be settled by peaceful means in line with international law and the united nations charter, he said, stressing that the dispute concerning the south china sea should be addressed on the basis of the 1982 united nations convention of the law of the sea as well as on the principle of safeguarding maritime security, navigation and overflight rights and freedoms. he also noted the value of international cooperation and assistance in viet nam’s progress towards sustainable development, international integration and poverty reduction. while scientific and technological breakthroughs as well as globalization, are creating opportunities for unprecedented economic growth, the world is also facing new and immense obstacles, he said. power politics, the use or threat of force and the rise of unilateral measures still threaten global peace and stability, while injustice, inequality, climate change, pollution and poverty persist. “no single nation can singlehandedly address the enormous global challenges,” he said, stressing that common efforts and collaboration of all nations are needed. the international community should uphold “dual responsibility” in which each nation and individual should take additional responsibility for addressing global issues. he also called for the lifting of the unilateral embargo on cuba so that it may equitably and fairly participate in economic and trading relations. mankind’s progress is measured not only by technological advances, but by peace and prosperity; even the smallest opportunity for peace must be cherished and nurtured. “the voice of small nations and the aspiration of the disadvantaged need to be respected, heard and shared,” he said. he called for stronger high‑level united nations‑asean cooperation. with a foreign policy based on cooperation, development and international integration, viet nam hopes to contribute more to the creation of multilateral mechanisms, he said, noting that it had dispatched a level‑2 field hospital to the united nations mission in south sudan (unmiss). lastly, he noted his country’s candidacy for non-permanent security council membership in 2020-2021, thanking the asia-pacific group for its endorsement and calling for the support of all member states."
Yemen,,"abdrabuh mansour hadi mansour, president of yemen, said that his country is still in the grips of war imposed by armed militias supported by iran and hizbullah. these militias are extremists that employ gangster‑like tactics, including blowing up houses and places of worship, and recruiting children by force. his government strives to restore peace, security and stability, provide services and create a democratic state where human rights and the dignity of women and youth are respected, based on the national dialog conference and in accordance with various security council resolutions. yet, the predicament faced by yemen is not a political conflict that can be contained by dialog, he said. certain factions have torn down yemen society and sowed hate. nationally, they are a proxy that is beholden to iran and hezbollah. he called on the international community to bring pressure to bear on iran so that it halts intervention in yemen. that country is financing the huthi militia and provides it with weapons, missiles and experts and jeopardizes international shipping routes, overwhelming the country with the illicit trafficking of drugs. the yemeni government’s high-level delegation to geneva was keen to take any opportunity to ensure benefits that would alleviate the suffering. however, the intransigence of the huthi militia has disappointed yemenis regarding any progress that could be made. yemen is fully ready for a sustainable peace based on national, regional and international terms of reference, he said, adding that it is not an advocate for war and vengeance. the state should be restored and the coup ended. but peace cannot be obtained by cajoling gangsters as some member states do, rather by implementing international resolutions. member states should abide by security council resolution 2216 (2015), which calls on the huthis to withdraw and hand over their weapons. he called on the security council to act resolutely in implementing its resolution to ensure a political transition in yemen. he then underlined his government’s efforts to protect civilians, especially women and children. the government has instructed the various units of its army not to recruit children, but rather strive to protect them and to rehabilitate those that have been detained while in the ranks of the rebels. the economic hardship felt by yemen is due to the militias that have wasted resources and reserves. in the face of that, and to stop the continued deterioration, the government has introduced measures, including the setting up of an economic commission which has been authorized to take all measures to stop the deterioration of the currency. despite limited resources, yemen continues to participate in the fight against terrorism and the government will not step back from any measures that would counter the financing of terrorism and money laundering, he stated. in the twenty-first century, the rule of the mullahs could no longer be accepted, as represented by the huthi militias that want to see a return to the dark days of despotism. his country would continue to strive and leave no stone unturned to restore peace and security. he offered his thanks to the government of saudi arabia, which had played a key role in alleviating the humanitarian crisis in yemen, and also added his thanks to humanitarian organizations in the arab coalition countries and various united nations bodies for their exceptional humanitarian efforts."
Zambia,"republic of zambia permanent mission of zambia to the united nations, 237 east 52nd street, new york, ny 10022 tex: (212) 888-5770 fax: (212) 888-5213 e-mail: zambia@un.lnt vlease statement by his excellency mr. edgar chagwa lungu president of the republic of zambia at the plenary of the general debate of the seventy-third session of the united nations general assembly tuesday, 25""^ september, 2018 new york • your excellency ms. maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the 73^^ session of the united nations general assembly, • the united nations secretary-general, mr. antonio guterres, • excellencies, • distiguished ladies and gentlemen let me join other world leaders in congratulating you on your election as president of the 73""^^ session of the united nations general assembly. zambia is delighted that after a decade, (2007 to 2018), a woman has yet again taken up this important seat at the helm of global governance as the fourth woman president of the general assembly since the establishment of this world body. as the united nations (un) celebrates its 73rd anniversary next month, its relevance to the people it serves should continue to be magnified in the promotion of international peace, cooperation and the development of sustainable societies free of hunger, poverty and disease. in striving to make the united nations relevant to all, we should endeavor to explore new ideas and best practices to meet expectations of our people, amidst a renewed necessity for effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability in the utilization of limited global resources. in pursuit of this year's theme, and focusing on the priorities of the general assembly as outlined by your office, we are confident that you will also bring to the fore, a fresh dimension, as we jointly seek solutions to global economic, social and political challenges. zambia stands ready to fully support you madam president as you diligently discharge the responsibility of this assembly. madam president, i am coming from a continent that should be standing tall and moving towards rapid human security, economic transformation and infrastructure development. indeed a lot should have changed in africa since the formation of the united nations 73 years ago. yet until recently, africa's economic structure has changed veiy little, a concern which has been voiced at both continental and global fora. the effective implementation of the 2030 agenda and the african agenda 2063 therefore, present huge opportunities for africa to revitalize its growth and further accelerate its transformation, as both frameworks seek to achieve inclusive growth, sustainable development, peace and security for the continent. the development path of zambia guided by its ""vision 2030"", through the implementation of the seventh national development plan, is intended to make the nation a prosperous middle-income one by 2030. to achieve this, however, we must overcome many hurdles. our economy, as with many other developing economies, largely depends on primary commodities for its economic grcwth and has not been spared by the negative impacts of declining commodity prices on the international market. my government is, nevertheless, committed and determined to overcome this challenge by creating a diversified and resilient economy driven, among others, by agriculture, tourism and the energy sectors and supported with a robust infrastructure development and conducive policy frameworks. my government also recognizes that to deliver inclusive and equitable development to the citizens, we need strengthened mutually beneficial partnerships in the context of south-south cooperation and with our development partners. regional and development cooperation therefore, remain crucial to unlocking diversified growth. madam president zambia is dedicated to the implementation of the africa union agenda 2063, the united nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development, and the sustainable development goals, including on climate change and the addis ababa action agenda on financing for development. that is why my government has mainstreamed these global development agendas in its 7^ national development plan. my government has consequently, been making progress in infrastructure development as a key enabler and for better capitalisation of the broad-based recovery and improved outlook of the economy. infrastructure development in road construction and rehabilitation, expansion and construction of hydropower stations, as well as, diversification of energy to renewable energy such as solar, the rehabilitation of railway lines, construction and modernization of airports, have been some of the key programs my government has recently undertaken. we are further implementing several policy and structural reforms under the economic stabilization and growth program (esgp), which has included measures on: improving domestic resource mobilization through modernization and automation of revenue collection processes, enhancing of tax incentives, and broadening the tax base of the economy. whilst we pursue these goals, we are mindful of the challenges in financing development, as well as the declining resources and official development assistance, especially to countries in special situations such as ldcs and lldcs. we therefore call upon all partners to work with us, and ensure that together, we effectively implement the sustainable development goals. in this regard, let me convey my best wishes for the success of the second un high level conference on south-south cooperation to be hosted in buenos aires, argentina in march 2019. we believe it is an opportunity to register significant progress for development cooperation, and in solidarity to advance the cooperation among the countries of the south, and we must all strive to achieve this goal. madam president, since 1945, the united nations and the international community have been consistently and strongly advocating the need for the preservation and promotion of peace. a number of recent development frameworks have also put due attention on the importance of protecting global peace and security. the united nations is a family where each nation, each person should feel protected from conflict, sexual violence, discord and other undesirable consequences of natural or human activity. my government therefore, fully supports resolution 2378 (2017) which focuses on peacekeeping reforms, with member states being the center of gravity through mediation, ceasefire agreements, monitoring and implementation of all peace accords. zambia also commits itself to the action for peacekeeping (a4p) initiative of the united nations secretary general as contained in the declaration of shared commitments for united nations peacekeeping. i am glad to further state that, my government has in the recent past increased its participation in un peacekeeping operations, and stands as one of the major troop and police contributing countries in redressing conflicts around the world. additionally, zambia has increased the number of women participation in peacekeeping operations as an added dimension to effective protection of women and children in conflict zones. we also join other member states in saluting the gallant men and women in blue helmets for the sacrifices they are making. in further contribution to the peace agenda, zambia recently took up the chairmanship of the organ on politics, defense and security of the southern african development community up to august 2019. we are grateful to the regional leadership for entrusting us with this important responsibility. i can only assure you that we will discharge this duty with utmost dedication. to our friends and partners around the world, i call upon you to work with us as we continue to steer the sadc security architecture, keeping in mind our overall responsibilities to each of the almost 300 million people of the region. my government is keen to learn and exchange ideas on how we can achieve the best results. my government will in this regard, continue to support all united nations peacekeeping mandates that bring to the fore the highest standards of un commitment towards conflict prevention, management and resolution. madam president, on gender equality and women's economic empowerment, i wish to reaffirm the commitment of my government to eliminating all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls. a conducive policy and legislative environment is further strengthened through the review and enactment of new legislation and policies that are gender responsive. consequently, the implementation of 50-50 enrolment policy is making head ways as schools are now compelled by law to enroll an equal number of girls and boys. since last year, 2017, my government commenced the distribution of free sanitary towels to girls in rural and per-urban areas in an effort to retain then in school. this is out of the realization that the lack of proper sanitary towels, limits girls' access to education. i further wish to mention that the continuous implementation of the re-entry policy for pregnant girls is a success, as a number of girl children have been retained in school after giving birth, a measure we believe is critical in promoting equal opportunities for girls. i am pleased to inform you that our traditional rulers in all parts of the country including in the remotest areas, have come out in full force in fighting child early and forced marriages. we believe that these and many other efforts will lay a strong foundation for the attadnment of sustainable development goals and in particular goal number five (5), on gender equality and women's economic empowerment. madam president, the world has continued to witness imprecedented large movements of refugees and migrants, resulting in political, social-economic and human rights ramifications in a number of countries. large movements of refugees and migrants are too vast for one country to handle alone. thousands of refugees and migrants continue to die every day while looking for safety and dignity in other countries. we stress the importance of collaborative efforts of the global commimity in order to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration involving full respect for human rights and the humane treatment of migrants and refugees. we believe that if well managed, migration has the potential to contribute to the social-development of our countries, both countries of origin and destination. we, therefore, welcome the convening of the conference on international migration this december, and look forward to the adoption of the global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration, the first of its kind. my government is confident that the compact on migration provides us the opportunity to improve the global governance of migration, as well as strengthen the contribution of migrants to sustainable development. madam president i take this opportunity to underline the centrality of the principle of responsibility sharing for hosting and supporting the world's refugees, taking into account the differing national capacities and resources among member states. as one of the countries selected for the application of the comprehensive refugee response framework, zambia looks forward to the adoption of the compact on refugees which has among others, highlighted the specific actions needed to ease pressure on refugee hosting countries and communities. let me reaffirm my government's commitment to its international obligations, under the 1951 convention and its 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees. under these instruments, zambia takes its responsibility to offer protection to those who seek asylum seriously and will continue to play a meaningful role in assisting people affected by conflict situations, human rights violations and other threats to their wellbeing. madam president i wish to recognize the decision by the secretaiy-general and his team for the progress made in undertaking the mandate on the reform of the united nations development system, management and the peace and security pillar. it is with deep concern, however, that little or no progress has been made on reform of the security council. it will be recalled that in 2000, during the millennium summit, world leaders called for early conclusion to the negotiations on security council reform. in 2005 during the world summit, leaders expressed concern at the slow pace of progress and urged negotiations on security council reform to be expedited. thirteen years later, we are still no closer to agreement on such a fundamental issue that seeks to make the united nations truly representative, democratic and effective. next year, 2019, will mark the 40*^ anniversary since the item of reform of the security council was put on the agenda of the general assembly. you, madam president, have been entrusted by world leaders to lead the process of reforming the security council. we hope that you can report substantive progress by the time we mark the 40^ anniversary milestone. i wish, in this regard, to reiterate that africa remains steadfast and united in its call for two permanent members in the security council with all the privileges and obligations that come with that status, and five non-permanent seats. not only is this a matter of common decency and correction of a historical injustice, but it is also a matter of restoring the dignity of africa, which currently remains the only continent that does not have representation in the permanent category of the security council. it is in this vein that we also support the call for a non-permanent seat for small island developing countries whose challenges are so unique that it is imperative that their perspective be incorporated as a new dimension to the un's approach to international peace and security. i thank you for your attention.","edgar chagwa lungu, president of zambia, said little has changed in the african continent’s situation over the last seven decades. today, however, the effective implementation of the 2030 agenda and agenda 2063 present huge opportunities for africa to revitalize its growth and further accelerate its transformation, as both frameworks seek to achieve inclusive growth, sustainable development, peace and security. noting that zambia’s development path is guided by its “vision 2030” plan — aimed at making it a prosperous middle-income country by that date — he said its successful implementation still faces many hurdles. zambia’s economy, like those of many other developing countries, depends on commodities for economic growth and has not been spared by the negative impacts of their declining prices on the international market. reiterating zambia’s determination to overcome those challenges by creating a more diversified and resilient economy driven — among other things — by agriculture, tourism and energy, he said robust infrastructure development, regional partnerships and conducive policy frameworks will also play critical roles. the country has mainstreamed the 2030 agenda, paris agreement, addis ababa action agenda and agenda 2063 into its national development plans and is focusing on such initiatives as road construction and rehabilitation; the expansion and construction of hydropower stations; the diversification of energy towards renewable sources including solar power; rehabilitating railways; and construction and modernization of airports. outlining some of the country’s important policy and structural reforms, he spotlighted the economic stabilization and growth program, which improves domestic resource mobilization and modernizes revenue collection processes. meanwhile, zambia — mindful of the challenges in financing development as well as the declining resources and oda being allocated to least developed nations and other countries in special situations — continues to call on all its partners to help it implement the sustainable development goals. expressing support for council resolution 2378 (2017) on peacekeeping reform, he welcomed a stronger focus on mediation, ceasefire agreements and the monitoring and implementation of peace accords, and voiced support for the secretary-general’s proposed action for peacekeeping initiative. zambia has increased the number of its troops in united nations peacekeeping operations, including deployed women, he continued. in addition, his country recently took up the chairmanship of the southern african development community (sadc) organ on politics, defense and security, a position it will hold until august 2019. turning to gender equality and women’s empowerment, he underlined zambia’s commitment to eliminating all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls, noting that it implemented a “50‑50” school enrolment policy and in 2017 began distributing free sanitary towels to girls in rural and peri-urban areas to help them remain in school. meanwhile, traditional leaders across the country have been helping to combat child marriage and forced marriage. noting that the world is witnessing a movement of migrants too vast for any one country to handle alone, he underlined the importance of collaborative efforts and stressed that — if well managed — migration has the potential to contribute to the socio-development of both origin and destination countries. voicing support, in that respect, for the global compact for migration, he also underscored the centrality of the principle of responsibility sharing for hosting and supporting the world’s refugees, while considering the differing capacities and resources of member states. expressing concern over the little progress made in reforming the security council, he reiterated the call for two permanent members representing africa, declaring: “not only is this a matter of common decency and correction of a historical injustice, but [also of] restoring the dignity of africa.”"
Zimbabwe,"stat ment by his excellency emmerson dambudzo mnangagwa, president of the republic of zimbabwe, at the general debate of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly, new york, usa: 26 september 2018 1 your e cellency, ms maria fernanda espinosa garces, president of the 73rd session of the general assembly, your majesties, your excellencies, heads of state and government, your excellency, mr. antonio guterres, secretary general of the united nations, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor and pleasure to deliver my maiden statement in this august assembly. allow me to congratulate you. madam president, on your election to preside over this 73rd session of the united nations general assembly. as only the fourth woman to hold this important position in the history of the united nations; your election is indeed most appropriate in ter s of addressing gender equality in our organization. the theme which you have chosen, making the un relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies resonates well with the mantra of agenda 2030 namely to leave no one behind. the theme is a timely reminder for us to keep the momentum going three years after the adoption of the sustainable development goals. madam president, also at the heart of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development is a promise to end all forms of poverty. this shared vision and common destiny requires us to put all our hands on deck in order to meet the ambitious targets and create a better world. for us, in the developing world, the eradication of poverty is at the top of our agenda priorities. development must equally be placed at the center of the work of the united nations, as it plays an important role in preventing hunger, deprivation, food insecurity, disease and ultimately conflict. the inclusion of the interests and views of women, the youth, children and vulnerable members of our societies should be integral and essential components in all our programs. madam president, distinguished guests, i am pleased to report that zimbabwe has made substantial progress in the implementation of some of the sustainable development goals, in particular with regards to ensuring food security. through our people centered policies and planned programs, complemented by private sector financing and investments; farmers receive inputs, equipment and technical support. in a bid to improve nutrition and broaden income opportunities, we have also extended support to grow the livestock, fisheries and wildlife sectors. we are confident that these multi-pronged programs will accelerate zimbabwe s re-entry into the global economy and associated value chains. this is one example of innovation, creativity and home grown solutions in addressing key developmental and economic challenges in spite of the continued illegal sanctions imposed on our country. we call for their immediate and unconditional removal. meanwhile, we look forward to the first overall review of implementation of the sdgs to be held under the auspices of the general assembly in 2019. madam president, peace, security, stability, democracy and good governance are essential ingredients for sustainable development. in view of the fact that elections as an integral element of democracy, my country held the much anticipated harmonized general elections on the 30th july 2018. following my deliberate and conscious decision to open up the democratic space and emphatic call for peace, unity and tolerance of divergent views amongst our people; political contestations, election campaigning, voting and counting processes were conducted freely, peacefully and transparently. in the spirit of transparency and openness, a broader spectrum of international observers and global media houses were accredited to observe our elections. the exceptionally peaceful pre and post electoral environment represented the maturing and entrenchment of democracy in zimbabwe. we are grateful to the un and other member states for sending election observer missions and for the technical assistance received by our election management body. the recommendations will be taken into account as we deepen our democratic and electoral processes. we shall continue to entrench constitutionalism, democratic traditions and norms, peace unity and harmony; for it is indeed under such conditions that sustainable development, inclusive economic growth and prosperity can occur. the isolated and unfortunate incident of the post election violence that occurred on 1 august 2018 is regrettable and most unacceptable. the commission of inquiry comprising eminent persons of national, regional and international repute has now begun its work in earnest. their ultimate report and recommendations shall help us bring closure to the matter and assist in the improvement of our institutional governance. madam preside t, distinguished guests, now that the elections are behind us, my country is now focusing on economic development as we seek to leapfrog the mordenisation and industrialization of our country. the land reform program is behind us and is irreversible. emboldened by the dreams, hopes and aspirations of our people, and in tandem with the united nations agenda 2030 and the african union agenda 2063, we have outlined our vision to become a middle income economy with a per capita income of about usd3 500. this will bring on board increased investment, decent jobs, broad based empowerment and a society free from poverty and corruption by 2030. zimbabwe is open for business and we are presently undertaking a raft of economic and political reforms to ensure an environment that facilitates inclusive and sustained economic growth. we have put in place institutions and instruments that maximize land utilization and increase agriculture productivity. 8 equally, strategies are in place in the various sectors of our economy, to enable my country to enter the global value chains. the development and modernization of our roads, railways, airports, energy and ict infrastructure is being accelerated in line with our regional and continental quest for enhanced connectivity and integrated infrastructure. madam preside t, zimbabwe looks forward to playing a positive and constructive role as a free, democratic, transparent, prosperous and responsible member of the family of nations. we are committed to strengthen dialog, cooperation and partnerships, underpinned by mutual respect, common values and shared principles. the prevention of conflict must be a frontline strategy. my country remains committed to strengthening multilateralism and peaceful resolution of differences. in this regard, we should address the root causes of conflict which includes poverty, inequality, deprivation, disputes over land and resources, as well as struggles for self determination. peacemaking and peacekeeping must be complimented by peace building efforts to prevent recurrence and relapse into conflict. zimbabwe continues to make its modest contributions through the deployment of its personnel to various united nations peacekeeping and peace building missions. madam president, excelle cies, distin uished guests, the united nations and its organs require to be democratized. we join the call for africa to be represented in the permanent category and to have increased representation in the non-permanent category. this position is indeed justified, in view of the need to correct the historical injustice which has left the african 10 continent on the periphery of all major global decision making processes. we emphatically call for the review and reform of the bretton woods institutions and other international financial institutions. trade is an engine for development if conducted fairly and in accordance with agreed rules. we therefore call for negotiations under the world trade organization which foster inclusive and shared economic growth; and further advances the global development agenda. madam president, in the spirit of leaving no one behind, our efforts to promote global partnership for peace and development would never be complete unless we address the plight of people living under occupation. it is most saddening that some of us continue to turn a blind eye to the suffering of the people of palestine. 11 it is high time the security co ncil fulfilled its charter obligations and duties by implementing all its resolutions;
