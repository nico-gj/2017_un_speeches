sustainable development; management reform and reshaping the secretariat for making the un more efficient. my country also welcomes the reform of the united nations counter-terrorism architecture and the un demarches of making counter-terrorism a key element of its prevention agenda. as no country can fight alone this terrible scourge, we trust that the newly established un office of counter-terrorism wili increase our efficiency in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. in this respect, romania remains committed to the common initiative developed with spain for the future possible establishment of an international court against terrorism. we also expect an increased contribution of the un to the global efforts in the area of international migration, including in addressing its main sources. we hope for a consistent follow-up to the new york declaration of 2016. it is important, in my view, that the global compact for migration, whose negotiations will start soon, covers all dimensions of international migration, to the benefit of both migrants and host communities. we also support the reinforcement of the human rights dimension within all relevant sectors of the un activity. that is why i welcome the secretary general's upfront initiative on human rights, aiming at mainstreaming the human rights policies throughout the un system. ladies and gentlemen, i had the pleasure to organize, earlier today, a debate on a very important topic: making education for peace. the use of identity "fears" and of the "us versus them" paradigm cannot be left unanswered. in a context of increasing violence and disinformation, romania is convinced that only through quality education we can counter extremist trends which our youth is facing today. at the same time, we continue to be concerned with the security developments in and around our region. the belt of protracted conflicts around the black sea remains a serious threat. we are still witnessing actions undertaken at the expense of the principles and norms of international law. this proliferation of protracted conflicts in our neighborhood hampered regional cooperation and brought mutual confidence to historically low levels. that is why the international community should actively support and stimulate regional cooperation, confidence-building measures and address decisively these conflicts. romania has constantly flagged the need of strengthening cooperation of the un with regional and sub-regional organizations. to this purpose, we promoted a first resolution in this respect, in our capacity of non-permanent member of the security council, in 2005. ladies and gentlemen, romania would be proud to bring its contribution, once more, to the work of the security council. our bid for a non-permanent seat during the tenure of 2020-2021 is about my country's sincere engagement in supporting the un efforts for peace and security. it is about our enduring commitment to peace, development and justice. i am convinced that romania's solid track record of building trust within the un could bring a valuable contribution to the security council. our dedicated work in the 4 previous mandates speaks clearly about the intensity of our commitment and represents a wealth of experience. romania is honored to have been serving in un peacekeeping missions for more than 26 years, with mole than 10.000 romanian blue helmets, men and women. romanian military, as well as police and gendarmerie officers have operated and are currently operating in over 20 missions around the world, from pakistan and mall to angola and haiti. there are also other relevant contributions of my country to un efforts: we host in romania the center of excellence for protection and security - for training the un security personnel, and the emergency transit center for refugees, managed together with unhcr and the international organization of migration - the first such body in the world. if our endeavor to become a non-permanent member of the security council for the term 2020-2021 is successful, we will be honored to work even harder for the advancement of our common projects and of the organization as a whole. thank you very much!
