the numerous declarations and resolutions, the various united nations development decades, as well as the plans of action and other agendas adopted by the united nations are not fully effective. the result is clear: poverty persists and the gap between rich and poor countries is ever widening. this situation is exacerbated by the decline in commodity prices. mr. president, let us all mobilize in a powerful surge of solidarity to roll back poverty. let us match our actions with our words. in so doing, we will be providing conditions for a decent life to our people...; let us thus focus on people! • mr. president, we must, for present and future generations, save our planet. we therefore welcome the paris climate agreement, which cameroon, i recall, was among the first countries to sign and ratify. we are pleased that steps are being taken to implement it effectively. i would like to take this opportunity to strongly reiterate the legitimate and unanimous wish of developing countries. as we all know, these countries pollute less, and should thus receive from rich countries, which pollute more, multifarious wherewithal to effectively promote the goals of the paris agreement at their level. for africa, there are two major challenges. firstly, ongoing forest degradation in central africa. let us save the congo basin, the earth's second lung. secondly, the desertification affecting lake chad, which is disappearing. this vast body of water, which is essential for the survival of communities and biodiversity, has already lost 90% of its initial surface. let us save lake chad! by so doing, we will be contributing towards preserving the planet for the greater good of humanity. • mr. president, the quest for peace concerns us all. all countries must pool forces to achieve peace. therefore, is it not yet time for the voice of poor countries, especially those of africa, to be heard? is it not time, or rather high time, africa's message to the world were better taken into account? is it not high time we restructured our organization to give more weight to africa's voice within a revitalized general assembly, a security council that is more receptive and equitable to us? a world characterized by greater solidarity is the sine qua non for peace on earth. • mr. president, let me now conclude. peace is our most precious asset. without peace, we cannot take any sustainable and effective initiative in the interest of our youth and our peoples. the theme of the debate aptly reminds us of the commitment of the founding fathers of the united nations, namely to: - save succeeding generations from the scourge of war; and - guarantee a decent life for all, free from want, through cooperation. this debate urges us to renew our faith in the ideals and purposes of the united nations. let us together take up the great challenge of world peace and development. once again cameroon, as it did from this very rostrum on 10 september 2000, urges the world to rally together in one great coalition for humanity placed back at the center of our policies. for its sake, let us secure peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet. thank you, mr. president.
