session of the genereal assembly of the united nations new york, september 26, 2018 - your excellency maria fernanda espinosa, president of the united nations general assembly. your excellency antonio

distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, we are holding this 73rd general assembl at special moment, as we pay tribute to two great figures of world olitics who happen to e two africans -nelson mandela and kofi annan. on the da t at i complete exactly one year since my inaugurat on to t e pos of president of the republic of angola, on ehalf of the angolan people, i have the honor to address this tribune for the first time, with the hole internation l community represented here by its highest dignitaries. 1 would like to salute your excellencies heads of state and government present here and also the leaders from various inte ational organizations an bodies, because i consider you o be the direct laborers for the future of our planet. 1 would like to seize this sovereign opportunity to thank all of t e international com unity for the support rendered to the cause of eace and national reconciliation in my cou try. a special t ank goes to the united n tions orga ization itself hose role was decisive for the achievement of long-lasti g peace in angola through t e unavem and monua. peace 1 missions, and the important work ndertaken by its specialized agencies, namely unicef and the wfp ( world food program). we also believe that angola s experience in peaceb ilding and reconciliation between the warrin forces has been a positive example for the united nations, in the sense that it has allowed to dra useful conclusions on how to approach peace processes in other regions of the world. angola has a unique experience in terms of how to preserve and maintain long-lasting peace and con tant deepening of national reconciliation, social inclusion, mutual forgiveness and healing of wounds from an armed confl ct which ended 16 year s ago. your majesties, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. it is at this broad forum where we find ourselves that best solutions to the current, serious problems and conflicts that may hinder the urvival of humanity itself are discussed and resolved. 1 am referring to hunger and misery', which affect millions of citizens in the world, global warming and its consequences, mass migrations, trafficking in narcotics, trafficking in human beings, children and women for forced prostitution, religious intolerance and extremism, interÂ¬ ethnic aimed conflicts, or even the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons. established 73 years ago with the declared inte tion of restoring universal peace a d harmony, to provide equal rights to big and small nations a d to establish a world of cooperation, progress and ell-being, the united nations organization is still far from achieving the goals enshrined in its charter. while it is true that right after its establishment, the i mediate bipolarization of the planet into two antagonistic political and economic systems did not contribute to the easy enforcement o principles that work in favor of peace and international security, t would be unfair to deny that the un has played an important role in bringing colonial sm to an end, promoting hu an 2 rights, boosting inte ational development d cooperation, and management nd control of the ho spots of i stability worldwide. despite the progress made so far, we need to ackno ledge the old prevailing conflicts yet to be solved, such as the israel-palestine conflict in the middle east, the resolution of which will only be achieved through a solution based on two-states l ving side by side peacef lly, as advocated by the united nations and the over elming majority of its member states. we welcome the endeavors t at ave been made by the united states of a erica.. north korea and south korea, it the contribution of the people's republic of china towards the de uclearization of tire korean pe insula, ich has considerably eased the e isti g tensions that threatened to trigger a nuclear conflict that would likely be angerous not o ly to that region but to international securit in general. with the end of the so-called cold war, symbolized by the fall of the berlin wall i 1989, the momentary e ergence of a new political, paradigm oriented toward multilateralism, t e united nations volunteered to retake its action guided towards building a eaceful o ld order. we do believe that with hard work from all of us we will be able to achieve such a goal. today, in a time of ever-increasing globalization, there is no justification for the continued proliferation of conflicts apparently without a solution, of various dimensions in several parts of the orld, and t at entire populations continue suffering from their tragic consequences, virtually abandoned to their fate. therefore, there have been m ny voices demanding, profound reforms inside the united nations organization, which is abreast of the new realities, whe eby the emergence of new centers of econo ic and financial power, and technological and scientific advancements do fully justify the redefinition of its structures and intervention mechanis as well as the enlargement and refo m of its security council in order to better represent the different geo-political regions of the lanet. 3 your majesties. excellencies. ladies and gentlemen, the political setup of the contemporary world, where local, regional and intra-state conflict represent international tensions and threats to peace, demands that the united nations organizations play an increasi giy-active role in promoting and monitoring political, so ial and economic democracy building processes. this is the optimal avenue for a solution to the inte al, ethnic, religious and inter-state co flic s arisi g in most cases fro authoritarianism, e clusion, intolerance, radicalism, or interference in inter al affairs of sovereign states. the current proportions of nte ational terrorism, t ansnational organized crime, ille al immigration, xenophobia, human trafficking an drug trafficking and other evils affect the qual ty of life of the inhabitants of the planet and demand coordination at the highest level b all member states of our organization, this 73rd session of the uni ed nations ge eral assembly is being held under the theme making the united nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies". therefore, the un should give priority to the pro otion a d safeguard of human needs, and strive to solve humanity s global problems such as those pertaining to security, the environment, economic inequalities and development in order to ensure that global peace is reserved. our plea is that we should adopt a decentralized scheme for the global financial system, based both on promotion of trade and regional economic integration systems, and the enhancement of regional financial institutions in such ter s that allow for more sustainable economic develop ent. your majesties, la ie and gentlemen, 4 throughout our history as an independent country, our collaboration with the un has always been permanent in that it has allowed us today to be engaged not only in the re-launch of our economy, but also in the search for solutions for effective peace, democracy buildin and development in southern and central african regions. the republic of angola hereby expresses its willingness to continue supporting all efforts to promote cooperation among the natio s of the whole world, consolidate peace and defense for cooperation, trade and investment relations at the bilateral and multilateral levels. thank you ver much for your attention. 5
