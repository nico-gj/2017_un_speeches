Afghanistan,"Mr. President, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
As I stand here before you today, I am reminded that the wise men and women of 1945 displayed a unique capacity to learn from and act
on lessons of history. Shaped by the Great Depression, and
tempered by the carnage of World War 2, they 'established global order through institutions that would provide security and stability for generations to come. The UN, the IMF, the World Bank and other organizations were founded to coordinate responses to international challenges and to make crimes against humanity a thing of the past.
There can be little doubt that today, the scale, scope and speed of their imagination and efforts have not yet been matched. But future historians will judge these institutions on how they respond to the challenges of today, and the challenges we must confront in the future.
As global leaders, we seek certainty and familiarity in the rules of the
game which dominated the zo"" century. But in today's ever-changing
world, the dominant contextual characteristic defining our times is extreme uncertainty. It is easy to illustrate this uncertainty by looking at threats we are facing to our economies, our security, and our values .
There is an emerging consensus that advanced economies have yet to arrive at ""proper growth models"" to overcome high unemployment, decreasing income and wealth inequality. The threat of economic crisis, therefore, still hangs over us.
Sixteen years after the tragedy of September 11, the threat of violence by non-state actors has taken the form of a Fifth Wave of political violence. Driven by transnational terrorist networks, criminal organizations, cyber-crime and state sponsorship of terror, this Fifth Wave promises to be a decades-long threat to international security rather than a passing phenomenon. In the 20th century, the world came together to push back the spread of fascism so that democratic freedoms could be secured. Today, these very freedoms are under
1

attack from global terrorism. Terrorism is not only an attack on human life and basic freedoms, but an attack on the compact of citizenship- an attack on the nation state's relationship with its people which makes democratic societies unique, fair and free. We must confront the threat of terrorism as a united force, and meet it with a long-term solution that matches the long-term agenda of the terrorists . themselves.
And, lastly, despite the incorporation of tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the constitutions of most countries of the world, crimes against humanity still occur with painful regularity. The ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya is especially shocking. Aung '-San Suu-Kyl's lengthy -silence-was'tragfc,' as-our hopes'fhcitan icon of human rights would choose principle over power. I do welcome the chance for Afghanistan to have a seat on the Human Rights Council in order to have a more central role in discussions on these important issues. As a people who are still experiencing crimes against humanity - the latest being killing of civilians in the Mirza Ulang village and attacks on mosques in Kabul and Herat - we are keen to add our voice in support of human rights.
Mr. President,
Overcoming the destructive and disruptive patterns of change in the 21st century requires collective and coordinated action at the global, regional, national, local and individual levels. An effective, efficient and respected United Nations is the need of the hour--we must put
our zo"" century institutions to the test.
Therefore, I congratulate His Excellency Miroslav Lajcak on assuming the Presidency of the 72nd Session of the UNGA. I want to recognize and appreciate the efforts of His Excellency Peter Thomson during the previous session, and I commend His Excellency Secretary General Guterres for launching his reform of the UN.
If the UN did not exist today, we would have to invent it to address the demands of our time. Delivering on the promises of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the context of uncertainty requires reexamination of core functions, re-engineering of business processes, reinvigoration of organizational culture and value, and
2

reform of systems of accountability. If the UN is to be more relevant to countries like mine, it must deliver as One UN. But this has not yet been fulfilled. The inherited model of the UN agencies as instruments of technical assistance and capacity building should be subjected to the market test, namely value for money and sustainability of results in comparison to government, private sector and non-governmental modes of delivery. Mutual accountability is a proven mechanism of consolidation and expansion of partnerships, and trust-building.
Mr. President,
I am honored to stand before this distinguished assembly to represent and speak for the people of Afghanistan. We have borne adversity, deprivation and drought with dignity; met invasion with valor; defended our homeland with patriotic fervor. Being the frontline state in the global struggle against terrorism and the front line of defense of democratic freedoms, our people and security forces are accomplishing heroic deeds on a daily basis.
We, too-as a nation, a state, and a people--are reinventing ourselves to address the challenges and potential offered to us in the 21 st century.
With President Trump's recent announcement of his strategy to counter terror and stabilize South Asia, Afghanistan's enduring partnership with the United States and the international community has been renewed and redirected. We welcome this strategy, which has now set us on a pathway to certainty. The Afghan people have looked to the United States for this type of resolve for years. We pay tribute to all the men and women of allied nations who have served with us, particularly those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.
The strategy consolidates all instruments of American power, conveying a message that the Taliban and their backers cannot win militarily. Only through political settlement can we achieve enduring peace and I call upon all ranks of Taliban to engage in intra-Afghan dialogue.
We now also have an opportunity for a dialogue with our neighbors on how we can work together earnestly to eliminate terrorism and
3

contain extremism. I call upon Pakistan to engage with us on a comprehensive state to state dialogue on peace, security and regional cooperation leading to prosperity.
The Afghan government has proven that we are committed to peace through our own internal processes, as demonstrated by the peace agreement with Hizb-i-Islami. Now, we call on all of our neighbors, near and far, to join us through the Kabul process in our comprehensive quest for peace and regional stability.
However, moving forward, we ask for a change of perspective from
__9ur ~t~ rn ati~:>n~ ~J??!in ~~s ..f9I tqo Jq~g! the ~<2~fJict_lQ. ~fg~~mi~ta_11. ~_s
been viewed through the prism of civil war. But this war is not within
our soil, it is over our soil.
Today, there are over 20 international terrorist groups with an imposed presence on Afghan soil. The future of Afghanistan matters because we are on the frontlines of the global effort to eradicate the threat of terrorism. Our brave soldiers are fighting and dying for this cause, and the sovereignty of the Afghan nation, every day. Though we may be on the frontlines, the threat knows no boundaries. For terrorist groups who are harbored in the region, an attack in Kabul and an attack in Brussels, Paris, Barcelona, London or anywhere else are equal victories. President Trumps' new strategy includes the disruption and denial of sanctuary to terrorists whose motives know no boundaries.
However, a strong and enduring commitment from our international partners alone will not ensure our collective success in Afghanistan the roots of success are indeed within us, as Afghans.
Today, nearly three years into our decade of transformation, we are turning Afghanistan into a platform for stability. The foundation has been laid. We have articulated and are rigorously implementing roadmaps for reform. Namely, we are prosecuting the corrupt, ending corruption in the security sector, replacing systems of patronage with merit-based systems, and making financial processes transparent.
4

We are also reaching out to those who had previously been excluded from society-young people , the poor, and women. Yet these people are our nations' source of resilience.
The generation who grew up in the 1990s, which make up the majority of our population, are now being entrusted with wholesale leadership of the country. A generational change is taking place as youth are empowered at every level. This generation will be the one that reforms the government into one that is citizen and service oriented.
Through unimaginable hardship, women kept the fabric of our communities and societies together even as they fell to shreds. Yet women were relegated to the very bottom of society. This was unacceptable and our nation suffered for it. Today, there are more Afghan women in government, in the workforce, and active in civil society than ever before in Afghan history, yet we still have far to go. At the helm , we have 6 women Ambassadors, and 4 women cabinet members. Simply put, women's empowerment is crucial to our future.
The poor, along with the women and the youth, are the numerical majorities in Afghanistan that crosses ethnic, linguistic, gender and religious lines. About 40% of Afghans still live below the poverty line. Research shows that poverty perpetuates itself because it affects the scientific make-up of a child 's brain . We must empower the poor. For far too long, they have been the silent majority in our country.
We are recreating the bonds of society in order to change the culture of our state.
And not only are we strengthening our bonds internally, but regionally.
As we look to our neighbors in south and central Asia, we are simultaneously strengthening national, global and regional connectivity. Afghanistan will again become a multi-faceted hub in the 21 st century--for transport, energy, water and mining--for the benefit of the entire region's economic prosperity and security.
5

And we are already seeing the fruits of our labor. Transmission lines for the Central Asia-South Asia power project are under construction. The Turkmen railway has reached our border. The TAPI natural gas pipeline is under construction. As a central part of our plan for economic advancement, we continue to work with our regional partners to seek avenues of collaboration. We can see now, amidst the uncertainties and unique challenges and threats of the 21 st century, how Afghanistan has become a
zo"" conundrum for the century approaches in which the global order
tends ! o stH_I_operate within. While the threat of international terrorism playing out on our soil has dominated the narrative of our country and driven the fate of our people for far too long, we also have enormous potential to be the regional brokers of peace, a hub for economic prosperity, and a beacon of democratic values. The birthplace of Rumi still resounds with messages of love, peace and hope . Afghanistan will, yet again, be the Asian Roundabout for dialogue of civilizations and a model of harmony and culture of tolerance and engagement. I am confident that our plans and programs for self-reliance and reform, bolstered by the commitment of our international partners, will chart us on the path toward realizing our full potential. I thank you.

Albania,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
How many times has it happened that humanity was confronted in a relatively short time with so many complex challenges as nowadays?
Has there ever been another period in what we call the modem times When we had to deal with so many pressing issues at the same time?
When was the last time that we remember when we were all confronted with such a conflicting prospect: that of an inspiring world that grows richer by the hour, driven by the tremendous progress of science and technology; and, on the other hand, that of a planet that seems to have lost its way, its energy and its vision and is erratically spiraling downwards?
There are no simple answers to complex questions. Yet, facts are stubborn and, in many respects reality looks grim.
Global terrorism and extreme radicalization continue to threaten our values and our way of life. They have become a persistent threat with the blind ability to strike everywhere, indiscriminately, with far reaching consequences as we have, sadly, witnessed so many times, including in the recent past.
Several brutal and seemingly intractable conflicts continue to devastate the lives of millions of people, threatening the future of entire generations. Armed conflicts are nowadays greater in complexity, the actors involved are numerous and the weapon and tactics used are more sophisticated. So are also the consequences, which continue to inflict endless human sufferings. 65 million people, the highest number since World War II that have been forcefully and brutally unrooted from their homes, constitute an indictment of our collective failure.
Climate change, a defiant truth that some still dare to question, is putting at risk our very own survival. It constitutes one the most fundamental challenges of our century, as it continues to cause increased humanitarian stress. Disasters are becoming more frequent and intense and, for one, the current hurricane season in the Atlantic reminds us that nature will always have the upper hand unless we become aware of the need to quickly adapt our way of life and protect our planet, our lives and that of our children.
The international global order has been seriously challenged without anything credible or promising to replace it. Worse, the situation in South Est Asia, a prolonged and recently

exacerbated crisis sparked by the policy of a stubborn totalitarian and paranoid regime, has brought back the dreadful fear of nuclear confrontation.
Inequality has continued to rise while, in contrast, the world becomes wealthier. This puts seriously in doubt the validity of promises and the guarantee of positive result to the benefit of all so many times advocated from this very place.
No country, however big, rich or powerful, can face or solve such problems alone. These challenges require a unified vision and a concerted reaction. In an increasingly globalized world, our vision and action need to be inclusive and universal, and bring people, communities and countries together.
And I, the leader of a small nation, hereby reiterate our pledge that we will faithfully do our part.
Mr. President,
The rise of violent extremism and non-state armed groups, perpetrating atrocities, particularly against ethnic and religious minorities, continues to be one of the most pressing challenges. The decisive action from the International Coalition has paid off. DAESH has lost almost 90% of the territory it once controlled and its ability to wage war has been severely diminished. Yet, let's make no mistake: its defeat on the ground doesn't mean it will disappear. Our response to extremism, radicalisation that leads to terrorism must continue and be adapted to the very nature of the persisting threat.
Albania was among the first countries to join the global coalition in the fight against ISIL/Da'esh and international terrorism. We are now implementing a 3 year Action-Plan as an instrument to implement the National Strategy on CVE. We welcome the increased attention given to the role of regional organizations in security issues. In this respect, we highly appreciate and welcome the close cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union, on the platform of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).
Mr. President,
All over the World, people want to be safe: free from violence, oppression, persecution and fear. They want to be treated with dignity, to know that their life matters, without distinction by gender, race, national or social origin, religious belief, political affiliation, property, birth or any other status. In order to achieve these goals, we need to go beyond declaratory undertakings. People rightly demand us to show responsibility and ability to act. The pledge to leave no one behind is the central theme of the 2030 Agenda on SDG-s.

Albania is fully committed to protect and promote all human rights, in particular, women rights, which is another major battle for change that my Government is leading. I am proud to announce that for the first time in the Albanian history half of the members of my government are women. They bring leadership skills, strength of character, commitment to our European values, and special devotion in serving the Albanian people. Furthermore, women count for around 30% of the members of the Parliament and 45% in the public administration. These may sound just mere statistics; instead they are the reflection of a platform to ensure that the role of women to development and change is recognized, their rightful place in the society is secured and their voice is heard.
It is my deep belief that empowerment of women serves as a powerful drive for overall economic development and national prosperity.
Mr. President, ""
One of the main national priorities for my country is to join the European Union. It is not just one objective in our foreign policy; it is not a contractual relation of sorts. For us, the European integration lies at the heart of our overall development since it touches every cell of our development architecture.
We are fully aware that it is first our own commitment and ability to make the necessary reforms that will determine the pace of the way ahead in the EU accession process. We are resolved to deliver on the fundamentals that consolidate the pillars of a democratic state, functioning economy and a government that works for its citizens. We want to measure our progress with results and the justice reform we are implementing is the best example.
We expect our EU partners to do their part in turn and clear the way towards opening accession talks. It will be a historic milestone in the process but also a strong encouragement for us to continue in the same path. We hope that in the EU, despite the current crisis, they continue to believe that the enlargement process remains the best European catalyzer for security, peace, development and prosperity. It has proved so in the past; it remains the right bet for the future.
A couple of months ago, at the general elections, citizens of Albania re-conducted me at the head of the government. They have agreed with our plans to prioritize consolidation of macroeconomic stability, employment growth, infrastructure development, energy, agriculture, agro-industry and tourism. Expectations are high and so is our resolve to meet them. Our target is to ensure economic growth of at least 5% each year through 2020.
Mr. President
This brings me to one of my favorite subjects: the development of regional cooperation and the transformation of the Western Balkans into an area of free movement of people, goods,

capitals and ideas, to the best benefit of everyone living there. It remains one of the main pillars of our foreign policy.
There have been times in the past when we used to come here and spend time and energies in competing with some of our neighbours on how to belittle each other, tell our one sided stories, and try to convince the world on our specific narratives. This is hopefully long gone. The best proof of the profound change in the Western Balkans lies in our joint efforts with a shared sense of responsibility and common purpose to make the region a natural part of Europe.
Together with the European Union and based on its principles and policies we are working to bring down every barrier to free trade by encouraging transnational economies. The implementation of the Regional Economic Area which we agreed to last July in Trieste, will boost trade and benefit our economies. I have not the slightest doubt that by acting this way, we will be best able to protect and promote everyone's nationa! interests, respect the rights of minorities, strengthen good neighborly relations and move our countries and the region as a whole towards the EU.
A strong and healthy relation with the EU has proven key for the stability and reform progress in the Balkans. We have noticed that when EU is too busy with itself, this bond has shown to be fragile and insecure. This is why this important relationship needs to be fed and strengthened continuously as it also facilitates regional cooperation, increased understanding and work towards reconciliation in the best European tradition and record. As President Junker stated in his address of the State of the EU just a few weeks ago: there is need for a credible enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans in order to obtain more stability in the EU neighborhood. The revitalization of the Enlargement policy is the best deterrent to counter disintegration narrative fuelled by populist ideas.-It is my firm belief that as much as Albania needs the EU, the EU needs a stronger, developed and coherent Western Balkans.
Mr. President Ladies and Gentlemen,
We know it very well and practice has shown that in order to build a fully functioning region, all its members need to treated the same way. This is why we think that the admission of Kosovo at every regional body with equal rights as other countries is of paramount significance.
Many have used this place over the last years to express worries and fear that Kosovo Independence would unleash dark forces no one would be able to control. We have seen nothing of that. Instead, what has really happened it that Kosovars, Albanians and Serbs, once threatened

with extermination by a brutal regime, are now free citizens living in democratic country and contributing to further developing an open society.
Who can rally deny Kosovo's impressive achievements made during less than a decade of its independence, in the consolidation of its democratic institutions, good governance, multiethnic and interreligious coexistence, including the evident progress in the Euro-Atlantic processes? Every credible report on the current situation in the Wester Balkans would lead without any hesitation to the same conclusion: the Western Balkans today are far better off than 3, 5 or 10 years ago. Kosovo Independence unleashed unnecessary and artificial rhetoric but in reality has brought stability and cooperation.
Serbia and Kosovo are since several years now engaged into a serious dialogue toward normalization of their relations with the mediation and facilitation of the EU. It has increasingly produced a climate of trust for both countries and for regional co-operation.
This is even more a reason to remind those countries that have not yet recognized Kosovo to consider doing so. This should not be seen as a defiance or, even less, a loss as it is often wrongly portrayed.
We have said it before, we repeat it today: recognizing Kosovo, establishing relations and helping Kosovo move forward, something that 114 UN members have done so far, is a direct contribution to a better life for its citizens and an investment to the security and stability of the whole region, of all its countries, Serbia included.
Mr. President,
Let me end by highlighting the need for the UN to change in order to remain relevant, live up with its responsibilities, secure the promise of sustainable development, ensure human rights and guarantee peace and security for the future generations.
We are aware that this reform is about what we can and must do together to better support our common efforts in transforming our lives. The 2030 Agenda points the way towards a better future, the future we want and our children deserve. We cannot and must not fail in this promise.
Albania stands ready to do its part and cooperate with all those willing to invest in the future and make our world a better place for all.
Thank you."
Angola,"Statement by the RepuNic of Angola 72n Session of the United Nations General AssemNy
New York
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary=General, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola, allow me to congratulate Mr. Niroslav Lajc&k for having been elected to preside the 72nd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and to assure him the support of my country in the fulfillment of his mission.
I also congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the 71st session, for the capable manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session, and Mr. Antdnio Guterres, for his election to the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations. I wish him all the success in his mandate, and I assure him of the support and cooperation of Angola.
Mr. President,
As has been reiterated several times in this forum, peace and security are fundamental premises for stability, sustainable development, democracy and the promotion of, and respect for human rights. The theme chosen for this session, 'Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet,' is timely and compels us to collectively reflect on the action of the United Nations to solve the main problems affecting humanity.
We need an organization capable of promoting international peace and security by acting swiftly to prevent potential conflict situations, improving the global strategy to combat international terrorism, and placing economic and social development issues at the center of its action.
In this context, we appreciate the relevance of the four axes defined in the Agenda of this Session, namely: Prevention and Mediation of Conflicts to achieve sustained Peace; Promotion of Human Rights; Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; and the Paris Climate Agreement.
We reiterate our sL1ppoR to the Secretary-General's proposals for reforms with a view to revitalizing sd raioyq.alizing the resources of the Organization. The United Nations should act as the first irst-;sc in the promotion of peace diplomacy at the global level.
We also -eiterate the need to reform the Security Council in order to have it reflect the reality of the contempora world. ts cLr:.snt composition is outdated and needs to be urgently reformed. lnline with the .&frican position represented in the Ezwilini consensus, Angola restates the need to increase the number of Permanent Members to ensure a fair geographical balance. It is unfair


that the African continent, which accounts tot almost 40% of the member states of the United Nations, is not represented among the Pr'-', mbers in h .-- body in r-r,o o maintaining peace and security in the world.
Angola underlines the importance of multilateralism in solving global problems, in accordance with a logic of shared responsibility and benefits, in recognition of the legitimate interests of all, and in concertation towards realistic solutions.
Angola's attachment to multilateralism is strongly emphasized in its role in solving problems which threaten peace and security on the African continent, particularly in the Great Lakes Region. In the context of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (CIRGL), Angola has been leading diplomatic efforts with its regional and international partners to find a lasting political solution capable of guaranteeing security, stability, economic and sociN development, and democracy for the countries and peoples of the region.
This joint engagement has allowed for a substantial reduction of tensions in the region, with notable advances such as the continuation of the inter-Burundian Political Dialogue, as well as encouraging signs in the resolution of the political crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and positive developments in the peace process in the Central African Republic, which have made it possible to hold elections in the country leading to the normalization of its institutions.
Despite these advances, the path toward fully stabilizing this part of our continent is still long, and the parties involved carry the main responsibility for ending violence, respecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the citizens of their respective countries, and building their national political institutions. In this context, they must demonstrate with actions their commitment to, and engagement with peace agreements and other political platforms negotiated either directly or sponsored by regional institutions and the international community.
Mr. President,
The international community's collective action under the aegis of the United Nations should also cover the fight against terrorism. In this fight, a significant part of our effort should be directed at combating the causes of terrorism and violent extremism, which reside inter alia in the social crisis and institutional fragility of many States. The case of Libya is the blatant example of this reality.
The African continent has been at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, which has killed innocent civilians, caused extensive damage to property and destroyed the way of life of many of its countries. Angola fully supports the efforts of the African Union, with the assistance of its international partners, to confront this scourge.
Mr, President,
Two years ago, we adopted the Sustainable Development Agenda, an important instrument to guide the development strategies of our States. We hope that its implementation in the next 13 years will substantially reduce the major social deficiencies affecting developing nations.


The economic and finandal difficulties affecting most counus have had a negative impacL on the mobilization of financial resources for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, espeoio!y among the poorest, most vulnerable and with limited internal resources. International efforts aimed at securing the critical financial resources, should be guided by the Addis Ababa Agenda on Financing, adopted in 2015.
The Republic of Angola, which is now beginning a new cycle in its life as a Nation, is strongly engaged in achieving the 17 Goals of this Agenda, despite an adverse global economic environment. To this end, Angola has launched its National Development Plan, aimed at rehabilitating and modernizing economic and social infrastructures, promoting public and private investment, and enhancing training, qualification, and adequate management of human
resources.
Mr. President,
The World is moving towards consensus in recognizing the urgency of combating climate change. To this end, the Paris Agreement is extremely important in the development of enabling tools for protecting the right to development and strengthening resilience in developing countries.
Angola views this Agreement as a historic commitment, an encouragement to contain global warming and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The urgency for the world to advance in the implementation of the Paris Agreement has been dramatically highlighted by the recent climate related disasters in the various parts of the world. Angola joins in solidarity with the victims in Caribbean, Mexico, and the United States.
Mr. President,
In order to address this and other challenges of the international community, Angola will continue to be a safe and responsible partner of the United Nations, and to contribute to the implementation of its Agenda in an engaged manner. We are increasingiy able and fit to play a decisive role in restoring peace and security, particularly in Africa, and in furthering its economic development. To that end, Angola has remained stable, and pacification of the country has been achieved.
The Republic of Angola has recently held its third general elections in peacetime, in a climate of tranquility, respect for differences and high civility, which shows the stability the country lives and that the gradual consolidation of democracy is a fact.
The priorities for the new government will be focused on economic development, with particular attention to combating poverty, reducing inequalities, combating unemployment, improving governance insufficiencies, and development indicators--a sine qua non for building a prosperous and democratic society.
Hr. President,
Regrettably, peace is still not prevalent in many regions.


Concerning Guinea-Bissau, a country linked to Angola by historical and brotherhood ties, we remain confident and expectant regarding the resolution of the political impasse, in this regard, we strongly support the efforts of aft the Guinean, regional and international political and social actors, such as ECOWAS, the African Union, the United Nations, the European Union and the CPLP.
The issue of Western Sahara should continue to merit due attention by the United Nations to ensure the effective implementation of the relevant Security Council and African Union resolutions. Angola encourages the main parties involved to continue the dialogue in order to resolve the dispute.
In the Middle East, we are concerned with the impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Angola argues that the solution lies in the existence of two States, living side by side in peace and security.
The tension in the Korean peninsula poses a serious threat to international peace and security. Angola joins the voices advocating for a diplomatic solution and compliance with international Non-Proliferation instruments. The peoples of the region deserve to live in peace and not under the specter of a conflict the effects of which would be devastating and unacceptable to human consciousness.
Mr. President,
Angola promptly welcomed the steps taken to normalize relations between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America, which will benefit the two peoples. The complete lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo would contribute significantly to ease tensions between the two countries and would eliminate one of the last remnants of the Cold War. This unilateral measure limits the Cuban people's enjoyment of development, and its extraterritorial effects violate the principles and rules of international law.
Mr. President,
The promotion and protection of human rights has always been at the forefront of Angola's foreign policy priorities, as evidenced by the fact that it is a party to the main international human rights instruments and maintains an exemplary cooperation and ongoing dialogue with the UN Human Rights mechanisms. It is in this context that Angola is a candidate to the Human Rights Council for the elections that will take place in October 20""t7. We look forward to participating actively in, and contributing to the protection of Human Rights in the regions and countries most affected by violations of these rights.
In this regard, we WOLCJ highly appreciate the support of the members of this Assembly to our candidacy.
#r. President,
t would like to conclude by urging all Member States to renew their confidence in the United Nations, to strengthen international dialogue as a key element of a culture of peace, respect for


differences )eween peoples, conii,. prevention, and a, foundations of progress and develoE)ment , whi,-'h all the peoes  th world hv - rihf Thank you!"
Antigua_and_Barbuda,"Mr President, Mr Secretary-General, Distinguished Colleagues, Ladies and
Gentlemen.
On September 6th, my small, two-island State, Antigua and Barbuda, was the victim of the ferocity of Hurricane Irma, the largest storm ever endured in the Atlantic in human history.
The island of Barbuda was decimated; its entire population left homeless; and its buildings reduced to empty shells.
Fortunately, Antigua and Barbuda was spared the full blast of Hurricane Maria just 9 days later, although, sustained winds of up to 60 miles per hour, gave us a troubling awareness, of the agony visited on the nearby islands of Dominica, Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico.
Having witnessed the devastation of Barbuda and the desolation of its inhabitants after the ravages of Irma, my heart bleeds for the people of the countries that have now been brutalized by Maria, and those that will suffer its cruelty in the coming days. Mr President, I have come to this Assembly because, I consider it to be of utmost importance, to speak to the world's representatives collectively about my country's experience and the huge challenges faced by the Caribbean islands.
Barbuda and its inhabitants were among the worst in the region affected by Hurricane Irma.
Barbuda is 62 square miles.
When Irma thundered over the island, it was 375 miles wide, with gale force winds of 220 miles per hour.
Barbuda did not stand the faintest chance against such size, such ferocity and such intensity.

The island was completely destroyed, and my government was compelled to evacuate all of the inhabitants to Antigua.
For the first time in over 300 years, there is now no permanent resident on Barbuda.
The footprints of an entire civilization have been emasculated by the brutality and magnitude of
Irma.
Everything that meant anything to the inhabitants had to be left behind - their homes, their possessions, their history; indeed, everything that defines them as a society and as a people.
Mercifully, Antigua, the larger of the two Islands, suffered no major damage and it could begin to function normally within 48 hours.
Had that not been the case, Mr President, how we would have coped, is simply beyond imagination.
Overnight, Antigua's population increased by almost 3 per cent. I know of no country that could easily cope with such an unplanned, unexpected and unscheduled increase in its population.
In addition to providing shelter and accommodation and basic necessities to the evacuated residents of Barbuda, the social services on Antigua are now under great strain, to provide school places for an additional 600 children; medical services for the elderly; and a means of income for
the able-bodied.
Naturally, the residents of Barbuda are anxious to return to their homeland. But, as I speak to you, the island remains unfit for human habitation.

4
There is no electricity, no potable water, and 95 percent of the buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged. Preliminary estimates have placed the cost of rebuilding Barbuda at about US$250 million.
That figure, Mr President, represents 15 percent or more, of my country's Gross Domestic Product of approximately $1.5billion.
It is simply, a stretch beyond our reach.
Antigua and Barbuda urgently requires the assistance of the international community, including the international development and finance institutions, to accomplish this vital task of rebuilding
Barbuda.
And, I should say, Mr President that we have not outstretched the palm of our hand because we crave; we plead because we need.
Barbuda is not only a natural disaster, it is a humanitarian crisis that now consumes Antigua.
Even as my government and people look forward to the assistance of the better-off nations of the world, I thank those nations and persons who were the first responders, particularly the government and people of the Bolavarian Republic of Venezuela; who went beyond the call of duty to assist.
I also acknowledge the commitment and contribution from the government and people of the Peoples Republic of China; the governments of Cuba, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Canada, Dominican Republic and sister states of the Caribbean Community, who gave generously fi*om the little they have.

That includes Dominica which, through one wretched night, lost a significant amount of precious lives and years of hard-earned development, at the unrelenting battering of Hurricane Maria.
On Antigua, Barbudans are being cared-for as best we can with very limited resources.
But as the period of care lengthens, not only do the conditions worsen, but the cost increases, causing my government to borrow money on commercial terms at high-interest rates, swelling our already burdensome national debt.
oooOooo
Mr President, the present international financial architecture is leaving small states such as mine
behind.
Whatever position on Climate Change any nation takes, the evidence of global warming is now irrefutably stronger.
Two Category 5 hurricanes within 12 days, that unrelentingly pounded so many countries, can no longer be dismissed as The vagaries of the weather', nor can they be explained as 'nature's doing'.
Hurricanes are stronger and bigger because they are absorbing moisture from increasingly warmer seas, caused by global warming.
And, that is a man-made phenomenon, whose manufacture is attributable to those nations, that consume 80 per cent or more of the world's primary energy, emitting dangerous levels of pollution into the atmosphere.
All 14 Caribbean Community countries together produce less than 0.1 per cent of global
emissions.

We are the least of the polluters, but the largest of the casualties.
The unfairness, injustice and inequality are painfully obvious.
If these frequent and brutal storms are to be withstood, Caribbean islands and certain parts of the United Sates, need to construct more resilient buildings and infrastructure than now exists.
This means, Mr President, that the international developmental and financial institutions, need to provide financing at concessionary rates without artificial impediments.
If this does not happen, the subsequent cost in lives and property is too frightening to contemplate.
oooOooo
Mr President, increasingly, states, such as mine, are victims of an international economic and financial system that regards us merely as a numerical statistic or mere nuisance.
We are measured by the level of our income, even though it is an insufficient and unreasonable criterion for establishing vulnerability, poverty and need.
Like many other small island states, my developing country is categorized as ""high-income"", thus denying it access to concessional financing and grant funding from international financial institutions and donor governments.
It is patently obvious, that the per capita income criterion is a skewed and flawed determinant.

It should be eliminated and eliminated immediately.
Because we are small economies with inadequate domestic capital formation, our countries open our doors to foreign investment, granting significant tax concessions to attract investments, and to help provide jobs and curb poverty.
The consequence, is that a small percentage of persons in our community, mostly expatriates, at the top end of businesses, earn the largest percentage of high incomes and the mass of the population earns considerably less.
In addition, government tax revenues are significantly reduced from the investment concessions granted.
It is time that those who control the levers of power in the economic and financial international community, acknowledge that the per capita system of measurement is discriminatory, and resolve to change it.
It is time that this particular swamp be drained.
Now is the time for action.
In these United States, in which the United Nations Organization is located, and in which this Assembly is gathered today, one of its early leaders, Abraham Lincoln, declared, at a critical time in history that: this country could not survive ""half-slave and half-free"".
He may have been speaking specifically of America and of the disunity that gripped it at the time, but he was talking about more than immorality; he was also talking about social and economic justice.

Lincoln's observation is compellingly relevant to social and economic justice in our worldtoday.
Injustice and inequality breed instability.
The world cannot survive with the wealthy few, controlling 90 percent of global resources: its centre will not hold, if the inequality between rich and poor nations increases; it will not be stable until social and economic justice prevails.
My country and its citizens do not want to beg for a living.
Mr President; we want to work for it; we want to earn our way. But, we cannot do so if the intemational system refuses to provide us with the means and the
tools to build our future.
Access to concessional financing is an imperative, that would give us a great leap forward.
It would take us out of the spiral of debt we incur, because we must repeatedly rebuild after disasters, with high-cost commercial money.
Where is the justice in large wealthy countries borrowing on their capital markets at 3 percent per annum, while so called ""high income"" small island states are forced to borrow commercially at 12 percent per annum, to repeatedly rebuild dsimaged infrastructure from hurricanes ?
Where is the justice ?
It is irrational and punitive, to graduate a small island state that cannot pay its debts, to high income status, thereby precluding it from much needed developmental funding.

Mr President, the theme of this Assembly's discussion is: ""Focusing on people - striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"".
That is all my people and the people of small island states want - peace and a decent life on a planet that is sustainable.
We deserve nothing less and we expect nothing less.
It is in that connection, that I draw attention to the fact that, even in the midst of our present crisis, Antigua and Barbuda is faced with demands from a Paris Club group of wealthy countries for the settlement of debt of US$130M, incurred four decades ago, because concessional finance
was - and is- denied to us.
It would be of enormous help to the plight we now face, and the daunting task of rebuilding Barbuda, at a cost upwards of $250 million, if those wealthy Paris Club countries would forgive, or at least reduce significantly, the debt that now weighs so heavily on our shoulders.
It should be noted, that the amount outstanding constitutes primarily accrued interest.
This would provide us with the fiscal space to borrow, as we seek to gamer every cent to recover and rebuild from Hurricane Irma and to give our people a chance to achieve a decent life, in keeping with the sustainable development goals.
In that same context, Mr President, my small country won a trade dispute with the United States in 2004, at the World Trade Organization (the WTO).
The US trade violation, led to significant loss of revenues to my country and unemployment of my people.

10
It has been 13 years since that judgement, and seven years since the final appeal by the US, resulted in a final ruling in my country's favour. Yet, the United States Government has failed to
settle.
The loss of trade revenues to my small country has risen to in excess of $200 million.
Our government has labored unsuccessfully for over 13 years to reach an amicable and
reasonable settlement with the US.
This is a classic case, where might is right and where the rights of a small powerless state has been trampled upon.
I should mention that, over the last 13 years, the US has also enjoyed a trade surplus with my small country, of over two billion dollars.
I am well aware that the prolongation of a settlement of this judgement, is not the making of the present US administration which inherited it.
But in the interest of fairness, ofjustice and of good conscience, it would be beneficial to my nation, in this hour of its great need, for the United States government to settle it.
In this very hall just two days ago. President Trump said of the United States: ""we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in
return"".
His observation, which I welcome, is equally true for the relationship with Antigua and
Barbuda.

11
Honoring their obligation to Antigua & Barbuda is not a one-sided deal, of which the United States gets nothing in return, because ultimately, 90 percent of the settlement proceeds will be spent in the US economy, as our primary source market.
The US is the greater beneficiary of trade with my country and has been so, year after year, for many decades.
Settling with us for over 13 years of trade losses would take less than one year ofthe trade surplus that the US's twenty -trillion-dollar economy has, with Antigua and Barbuda's mere onebiliion-dollar economy.
oooOooo
Mr President, over the last few days, the experience of the Caribbean islands demonstrate that entire and ancient communities, can be snuffed out overnight or, the quality of their life suddenly and irreversibly set-back.
I remind that, for the first time in more than 300 years, there is no permanent human resident on
Barbuda.
But, my Government is determined to rebuild Barbuda however long it takes, and with whatever
resources we can muster.
We are determined that no Caribbean society should be extinguished and that they should remain firmly on the global map.
But, even as we resolve, with limited means, to keep our societies alive and vibrant, we call on the international community to acknowledge its obligation to all humanity and to all peoples, without whom their own societies cannot prosper and will not thrive.

12
In the words of the Poet, John Donne: ""Any man's death diminishes me. Because I am involved in mankind. And therefore, never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
It tolls for thee"".
As citizens of planet earth, let us acknowledge our common humanity and work in harmony, to make our world a better place.
Thank you, Mr President."
Armenia,"Distinguished President of the General Assembly,
Ladies and gentlemen,
I congratulate and wish success to Mr. Miroslav Laj(5.k upon his election as the President of the 72na Session of the General Assembly.
I avail myself of this opportunity and congratulate anew Mr. Antdnio Guterres upon his election to the office of the LJN Secretary General. Distinguished Mr. Secretary. General .... we wish you success in carrying out your important mission. The priorities you declared enjoy Armenia' s support.
Ladies and gentlemen,
In 2017 we marked the 25th anniversary of Armenia's accession to the United Nations. On March 2, 1992 the Armenian tricolor flaunted at this headquarters of the United Nations family as a logical and sought for outcome of the exercise by our people of its fundamental right to self-determination.
Over the years, Armenia has become a fully-fledged and responsible member of the international community. There had been numerous challenges in before of us, and we withstood them with dignity. The most important and intricate one was the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.
It is for the fifth time that I have an opportunity to speak from this eminent podium and again I am compelled to address the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. I should have rather preferred to talk of peace, progress and cooperation, but unfortunately we are not there yet. Hence, it is my duty to explain why we are so much away from that desirable stage.
The new phase of the struggle for self-determination by the people of Artsakh began ahnost 30 years ago. The peaceful calls by the Armenians of Artsakh to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination as well as every step to that effect was met by use force, to which Azerbaij an continuously resorted to.
The policy of the official Baku culminated in the massacres, ethnic cleansing and mass deportation of the Armenian population of Azerbaijan. Once flourishing Armenianpopulated districts in their entirety have been wiped out of the Armenians, and the Government of Azerbaijan continues with its policy of systematic destruction of the vast Armenian cultural and spiritual heritage on the territories under its control.
It is obvious that, under such circumstances, the people of Artsakh were left with no other choice than to resort to self-defense. The grievous war of 1992-1994, its aftermath and negotiations that followed did not serve as a lesson for Azerbaijan. Last year in April,

Azerbaijan unleashed a four-day war, which came to prove that Azerbaijan pursues the objective of extermination of the people of Artsakh.
In the course of the military offensive unleashed in 2016, the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan committed a number of war crimes against civilian population and the prisoners of war. Here I am compelled to mention that a serviceman who committed such atrocities has been decorated with a high state award, and the President of Azerbaijan personally decorated him in front of the cameras.
Distinguished Mr. President,
It has been for years that hate speech and Armenophobia was made part and parcel of the Azerbaijan's state policy. It has taken deep root in the school curricula, intoxicating the younger generation. It has been for years that a number of inter-governmental and non.... goverm-tentaspeciaized organizations dealingwilracismmnd xenophobia have been ringing alarm bells about it.
All of these leads us to believe that the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of Artsalch is of existential significance. In this regard, I convey the consolidated view of Armenia and Artsal as well as the one shared by Armenians from all over the globe. I bring this message from Yerevan, where right now Armenia-Diaspora conference is taking place.
Everyone should be aware that for the democratically developing Artsakh Azerbaijan simply Symbolizes medieval baclcvardness. Azerbaijan has got no legal or moral ground whatsoever to present any claims towards Artsakh. Artsalch has never been part to independent Azerbaijan, and therefore the attempts of its annexation to that particular state framework cannot be justified.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Today free Artsakh is an established democratic society. Our shared motto and commitment of ""Leaving no one behind"" should be the milestone guiding the work of the United Nations family. It is exactly for that reason, I believe, that people of Artsakh should never be isolated from the implementation of the sustainable development goals.
I strongly believe that the unresolved status of the Nagomo Karabakh conflict should have no impact on the people of Artsakh as they exercise their rights. It is, first and foremost, about inalienable rights for any human being. It is about the right to life, the right to organize public life, the right to form freely one's own government, the right to communicate unimpededly with the outer world, and many other rights.
Armenia consistently contributes and will contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of the people of Artsakh, its sustainable and democratic development. No one has a right to create hindrances to the implementation of initiatives and projects to that effect. The legal status of Artsakh, or, to be more precise, the lack of the international legal recognition, is not and cannot constitute an obstacle for the women and men who live there to exercise their rights.

We strongly believe that there is no alternative to the peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. Right now, from this eminent podium, I reiterate our commitment to that effect.
Meanwhile, everyone should be aware that the Nagorno Karabakh issue is a human rights issue. It can be resolved exclusively ttuough one of the fundamental and inalienable human rights - the people's right to self-determination.
At the end of the day, whatever option for the conflict resolution we arrive at, the Republic of Artsakh should not enjoy a status and liberty that might be inferior to the one it enjoys today. Azerbaijan shall recognize and respect the right of the people of Artsalda to decide its own future tlrough a free expression of will. All available international and domestic mechanisms should guarantee the security of the Armenian population of Artsalch.
All remaining issues are collateral. All remaining issues will find their logical and fair solution in parallel to the general resolution process.
Distinguished Mr. President,
When I last time spoke from this eminent podium and addressed the process of international recognition of the Armenian Genocide, I considered it my duty to express our gratitude one by one to all nations that recognized the horrendous crime that was committed against my people in the Ottoman Empire.
It is my duty to express gratitude from this eminent podium of Honor and Responsibility to all those countries that have recognized or reiterated their position on the Armenian Genocide.
I thank them for it, regardless of the format and language adopted.
I thank the numerous countries and individuals, state bodies, regional entities and organizations, who called things by their proper names. That is, indeed, important since denial paves.the way for new crimes of genocide.
In this context, we recall that next year the family of the United Nations will mark the 70th anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Armenia will bring up a new initiative upon that occasion, and we invite all to join us and defend that initiative.
We, nevertheless, have never made the recognition of the Armenian Genocide a precondition for the normalization of the bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey. Moreover, it was upon the initiative of Armenia that a normalization process was launched, resulting in the conclusion of the Zfirich protocols in October 2009.
Up to this day, those documents have not been ratified, instead, they have landed in some dark drawers of the official Ankara. The Government of Turkey came up with. preposterous preconditions for their ratification that run counter to the letter and spirit of

the Protocols. I expressed the clear-cut views of the Armenian people on this issue three years ago, when I spoke from this eminent podium.
Now the time has come for additional explanations. The leadership of Turkey are mistaken if they think that those documents can be held. hostage forever and ratified only at the most opportune occasion from their very point of view. The Protocols were negotiated in the existing circumstances in order to find solutions to the actually existing
issues.
Armenia will declare those two Protocols null and void since they continuously lacked any positive progress towards their implementation. We will enter the spring of 2018 without those, as our experience has demonstrated, futile Protocols.
Armenia, nevertheless, continues to believe that any two neighboring states need to ..... stablish-and enjos, norma relations-in)rder-to address-all possibledisagreememts
between them and find solutions to such a discord.
This is the conviction we are guided by in our engagement with various integration processes. Today, Armenia is an active member of the Eurasian Economic Union and with its active work spares no effort in order to contribute to the unimpeded movement of goods and services in that large economic area and, hence, contribute to and promote welfare for all. We have already registered certain achievements in that regard, and that makes us feel hopeful for future. We also plan to conclude this November Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with European Union, which, in our view, will help us to give a new impetus to the institutional reforms implemented in Armenia.
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
The current instability in the Middle East regretfully remains asa serious challenge.
It is with great pain that we have been following the crisis in Syria and the humanitarian situation there, which has brought about suffering of the civilian population, including the Armenian comnaunity of the country. Within its means, Armenia strives to mitigate the suffering of the Syrian people by providing humanitarian assistance. We also express our willingness to engage into possible discussions on the peacemaldng efforts in Syria under the UN auspices and with an appropriate mandate.
Distinguished Mr. President,
I have no doubt that our family of the United Nations is able to guarantee a new quality of cooperation that will allow us to withstand the contemporary global and regional challenges. It is with that objective in mind that Armenia participates in a number of the UN peacekeeping operations. Moreover, we stand ready to increase our contribution in Lebanon and Mali to UNIFIL and MINUSMA missions, respectively.
Armenia, as a landlocked country located in the complicated region, a country with scarce natural resources, has continuously emphasized that human capital is its most

valuable resource. It is, indeed, correct both for Armenia and for our whole family of the United Nations: we should focus on people, we should strive for peace and a decent life for all, on a sustainable planet.
I thank you."
Australia,"Mr President
The United Nations was founded in response to the horrors of World War II. Nations resolved to prevent a repeat of that catastrophic global conflict. Over the decades since, we have worked together to build an international rules based order that ensures disputes can be resolved peacefully and that interests of less powerful nations can be protected from the overt or coercive pressure of more powerful states.
It dictates how nations should behave and towards each other. That order has supported and enabled the greatest economic expansion in human history.
There have been times over the past seven decades when the rules-based order has been under pressure.
We are now in a time when the challenges to that order are increasing.
The UN Security Council is the custodian of international peace, and security.
Yet the authority of the Council is being challenged, undermined, even ignored.
The most egregious example is North Korea.
The regime of Kim Jong Un is openly defying the UN Security Council.

Its illegal nuclear and missile programs violate multiple UNSC resolutions. The security of millions of people is at risk as a result of North Korea's refusal to abide by international laws and norms.
The International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty confirms that North Korea is the only state that is currently testing nuclear weapons and the only state to do so this century.
The Security Council has responded with tough new economic sanctions. It is crucial that all UN member states and especially the Permanent 5, who have a particular responsibility, strictly implement these sanctions to compel North Korea to abandon its illegal programs.
The authority of the Council must be defended and upheld.
Australia will play its part in helping to resolve this crisis.
We have already put in place a range of autonomous sanctions, beyond that mandated by the Security Council. We will explore further options, should North Korea continue its flagrant disregard of the views of the international community, as upheld by the Council.
The rules-based order is also being challenged by non-state actors, terrorism and violent extremism.


Global terrorism - and the extreme Islamist ideologies driving it - must be confronted and defeated.
Many nations including Australia have suffered terrorist attacks.
We can most effectively combat and defeat terrorism if we work together, sharing our knowledge and resources.
Our work continued this week at a meeting of the Global Counter-terrorism
Forum.
The use of chemical weapons presents another serious threat to the rules based order.
We know they were used in Syria.
Australia supports the work of the UN - and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - in identifying those who deployed these appalling illegal weapons.
This work must continue.
Australia chairs the 42-member Australia Group, which works to prevent the spread of chemical and biological weapons.


Our rules based order has been supported by institutions and over the decades, UN peacekeepers have become the defining image of the UN response to conflict and security threats.
Fifteen peacekeeping missions are currently deployed across four continents.
Often they are the only authority preventing civil breakdown and lawlessness in countries already suffering from conflict, poverty and despair.
Australia has been a long-term supporter of UN peacekeeping.
Last week in Canberra we commemorated the 70th anniversary of the first such mission, noting that in 1947 Australia was the first nation to deploy into the field, military observers to the then-Dutch East Indies ceasefire. We have contributed to 20 more UN missions.
We support the work that is underway to ensure UN peacekeepers are better trained, better equipped, more effective and act with greater integrity.
Peacekeepers operate in dangerous and unpredictable environments and represent one of the most important global investments in peace and security.


Australia welcomes the new UN Secretary General who has committed to reforming the UN, to make it more effective as the defender and upholder of the rules based order.
Australia fully supports Secretary General Guterres in that endeavor.
The UN must focus on conflict prevention as that is more effective than dealing with the tragic consequences of conflict.
UN management systems must be made more efficient and accountable.
There must be more women in senior positions.
To achieve reform, Secretary General Guterres needs the full support of member states.
The standing of the UN is maximized when we work together for the common
good.
Recent successes prove this to be true - the global arms trade treaty, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sustainable Development Goals.
If we are to meet the challenges of our age, we must be guided by a spirit of cooperation and compromise.


Central to our task is to achieve sustainable and inclusive development. The United Nations must play a more effective and agile role.
The UN development system should be more focused on sustainable economic development to provide employment opportunities and facilitate partnerships with the private sector.
Economic development and security are interlinked. One cannot be achieved without the other.
Each country has to find its own model for prosperity and stability. However there are many lessons to be learned from other nations, and much support is available for nations seeking to establish regulatory frameworks in particular, to support private investment that grows economies and generates employment.
Economic resilience can be undermined by natural and man-made disasters.
With the 2030 agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction and the World Humanitarian Summit's Grand Bargain, there is a blueprint for global action on those problems which can only be addressed by working together on challenges that don't respect national borders.


These include climate change, diseases including malaria, managing our precious water resources and modern slavery.
It is an unpalatable truth that forced labour, child labour, human trafficking and modern slavery are rampant in the world today.
Australia has strongly committed to working with the international community to urgently address these egregious crimes.
Last month Australia and Indonesia jointly launched the world's first regional business government partnership to address modern slavery, and have continued our advocacy with other nations this week. We will end these abhorrent practices.
Australia is a strong supporter of the Paris Agreement, and here at the UN we have voiced our support specifically on risk mitigation for coral reefs, which are among the most valuable environments on our planet.
They support more biodiversity than almost any other ecosystem, are vital to the world's fisheries, protect our coastlines and generate significant tourism revenue. Coral reefs sequester four times more carbon than forests, and are a vital element in our global efforts to reduce emissions.


Worldwide, more than 30 coral reefs are listed as World Heritage sites, and 29 are under stress. As the custodians of the Great Barrier Reef and with our extensive experience in reef management, we are seeking to bring our expertise to other locations. We hope to serve on the World Heritage Council
next year.
Australia has worked with other countries on each of these issues during the
past week.
We are mindful that no matter how much we work on building strong, resilient societies, crises will still occur.
Australia has been a strong contributor to relief efforts in Iraq and Syria, as well as in South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, where there are significant numbers of displaced people, at increasing risk of famine. Australia is also supporting those displaced by conflict in Rakhine State, Myanmar. We are contributing to funding life-saving food for up to 300,000 people.
Australia also seeks to serve, for the first time, on the UN Human Rights Council from next year.
I am grateful for the strong support from so many countries for our candidacy.
If elected, we will be a principled and pragmatic member of the Council.


Australia will be the first nation on the Council from the South West Pacific.
We will have an agenda relevant to our region and globally.
Empowering women and girls to reach their full potential lifts a country's productivity and underpins stability.
We will support freedom of expression.
The number of journalists and human rights defenders detained, abused or killed each year should be of grave concern to us all.
We will support good governance and strong democratic institutions.
Similarly, we will promote strong, independent national rights institutions - to raise awareness of human rights, to address violations and to hold to account those responsible for abuses.
Australia is proud to be the home of the world's oldest continuous culture and we will strive to advance the human rights of indigenous peoples around the globe.
Australia reaffirms our commitment to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.


We will also work with other members to enhance the effectiveness of the Human Rights Council, so that its work can make a meaningful difference to the lives of individuals around the world.
The Council must remain relevant to the broader international agenda, making a contribution to building stable, prosperous and compassionate societies.
We all strive for an environment in which countries can grow and prosper, in which individuals can aspire to a life unburdened by the threat of violence and driven by a shared vision of peace, compassion and community.
Australia, for its part, will work with others to protect an international order that ensures all states can pursue their interests securely and that supports cooperative responses to global challenges.
The United Nations can become an even more powerful force for stability in an uncertain world.
It can live up to the ideals and universal principles on which it was founded.
The people of our world expect this body to inspire the best in human nature and that is our duty.
Thank you."
Austria,"Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The world has never felt more }nsecure, at least not in my lifetime.
Four years ago, when [ first spoke from this podium, I was concerned about three serious challenges.
1. Violent conflict had returned to Europe with the crisis in and around Ukraine. 2, With the success of Daesh in Iraq and Syria radicalization and extremism sharply increased within our societies. 3. The potential humanitarian consequences of a nuclear explosion became a growing concern.
And today?
We still face a violent conflict in and around Ukraine. Acts of extremism and terrorism continue, And the crisis in North Korea demonstrates that the risk of a nuclear confrontation is higher than the world has seen in a long time.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
While we have achieved a tot over the past years, there are still too many conflicts around tile world. Conflicts that result in terrible human sufferh9, such as in Syria, South Sudan, Ukraine, Yemen or Libya. And there are also new sources of instability, such as in Venezuela or in Myanmar.
On a global ievef, poverty, hunger and climate change as well as orgapzecd me _ancLthep[otiferation of we.apons remai n key concerns.
And what really worries me is that we seem to have lost trust in the ability of States and institutions to solve these challenges.
As current chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe I can see this on a regular basis. This is a dangerous development because there is no alternative to [nternationai cooperation!

Ladies and gentlemer,
Just look at terrorism,
Terrorist organizations such as Daesh work on a global scale, More than 25.,000 persons die each year in terrorist attacks all over the world. And almost all of them are the result of extreme radicalisation.
This is why as OSCE chair the fight against radicalisation is a priority for
US.
We are working on concrete recommendations for OSCE States on how to better prevent and stop radical groups from misleading our citizens.
What we need to do, is to destroy these radical groups militarily where they operate, such as in yl ra and traq.
But we also have to be clear that after our military success more foreign terronst fighters will return to our societies.
This is why at the same time we also have to continue this fight within
our own societies, We have to take more action to stop radicals with police measures and prevent our youth from being misled.

Ladies and gentlemen,
The migration crisis is another global problem and source of instability. Over 60 million people are on tile rnove worldwide. No country can manage this crisis on its own.
tf we look at demographics we know that we have to act now, In time next 30 years, world population will grow from 7.5 to about 10 biition people, And Africas population alone will double from 1,2 to 2.5 bilIion.
........ The lastyears ha, shown how difficult-sudl arrassivedg rag-on movement can become. Over 1 million people have come to Europe via smugglers.
And thousands died in the Mediterranean. We need to stop this!
dncontroJled migratiori leads to chaos, Therefore, we need to manage Orderly migration and support people as much aspossibte in their countries of origin. in order to achieve this we should address three key issues:
1. Countries need effective control of their borders. Without such control, no government can establish security and maintain public support for legal immigration. Tile citizens need to have confidence that their gore-nments decide who should cross the border, and not the srnugglers!
2, The business model of traffickers of human beings must be destroyed. Securing the borders is the most important first step Smugglers cannot sell their ticket to Europe when there is no way to come through. People that are saved shall be brought back to their countries of origin or to internationally monitored migration centers in their region.
3. We need an effective support for countries of origin to establish a local perspective for the young generation there!

This is why over the past four years Austria decided to double its bilateral development assistance and to increase its emergency fund by four*.
I welcome that the United Nations is developing a Global Compact on Migration as well as a Compact on Refugees. They should ensure a more coordinated international approach to deal with these challenges.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Cooperation is also key when we address crises and conflicts around the globe. The crisis in and around Ukraine has lasted already for too long. More than 10.000 people have died. 3.8 million people are in need of humanitarian aid.
Desp!te the Minsk Agreements, heavy weapons continue to move into the region, and mines are being laid. Despite-negotians wbtJq:the Nor-mandy gr)ta, Iheqoolitcal process is stalled. Despite regular meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group there is no progress on the ground.
The worst thing is that civilians suffer the rnosL
The Special Monitoring Mission of the OSCE is key in stabitising the
situation. But its unarmed monitors are increasingly tt]reatened. And for the first time the mission lost one of its members.
Despite this tragic incident it is important to maintain the mission. From rny visit to tiqe conflict zone I know that without the OSCEs monitoring the situation would become even worse.
Therefore, in March this year the OSCE strengthened the mission by increasing the number of monitors up to a thousand and by providing better technical equiprnent.
I ais0 welcome the discussions in the Security Council to increase the security of the OSCE monitors, possibly with a UN Peacekeeping operation, More safety for monitors means more monitors on the ground. And more monitors on the ground means more security for the local population.

We are also working hard to find political solutions reaching beyond ceasefires. The goal remains clear: a free and stabIe Ukraine with good relations to both its western and eastern neighbours.

: , - ......................... T-r ..........................................
Mr. President,
Allow rne to turn to another security threat we must deal with.
The risk of a nuclear confrontation today is bigger than it has been in a tong time. The consequences of a nuclear explosion are extremely grave. Nuclear disarmament remains the number one unfinished business. And the recent escalation of tensions by the DPRK is a clear warning signal.
Austria has been consistently engaged in efforts to reduce the risk of a nuclear disaster and to work for a world without nuclear weapons. This is a hard and long road. We are not naYve about that. But it is a goal that we should fight for.
tn this regard, we welcomed the Vienna Agreement that placed Irans nuclear activities under international observation. Undermining this agreement would weaken efforts to achieve negotiated solutions for nuclear disputes.
The new Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is an important achievement in this regard. It is a crucial step to get rid of all nuclear weapons.
Today, we often hear that nuclear weapons are necessary for security. This narrative is not only wrong, it is dangerous. The new Treaty provides a real alternative: a world without nuclear weapons, where everyone is safer.
The overwhelming support of the international community in adopting this treaty, demonstrates that many countries share this goat.

Mr. President
At a time when universal values are u.nder threat, we need to be strong in standing up for human rights, the rule of law and good governance.
Protecting civilians and human rights has always been a priority of Austria's foreign policy. This is why we hope to be elected to the UN Human Rights Council for the period 201B-2021 and ]: would like to ask all of you for your support.
I can assure you that Austria will continue to work for effective international cooperation
And we will continue to actively support the United Nations and its new Secretary General.
Thank you!"
Azerbaijan,"Mr. President,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
For more than 25 years Armenia occupies 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and 7 other regions of our country.
Nagorno-Karabakh is an ancient and historical part of Azerbaijan. As a result of Armenian aggression almost 20% of the internationally recognized territory of Azerbaijan is under Armenian occupation. More than one million of Azerbaijanis became refugees and internally displaced persons. Armenia conducted the policy of ethnic cleansing against Azerbaijanis in Armenia, in Nagorno-Karabakh and 7 other regions of Azerbaijan.
Armenia committed genocide against Azerbaijanis in Khojaly. Khojaly genocide is already officially recognized by more than 10 countries. On February 26, 1992 Armenia committed war crime killing 613 peaceful residents of Khojaly, among them 106 women and 63 children. One of those war criminals who committed that terrible crime against humanity is current Armenian President.
Leading international organizations adopted resolutions demanding withdrawal of Armenian troops from the territory of Azerbaijan. In 1993, United Nations Security Council adopted 4 resolutions demanding immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian troops from the territory of Azerbaijan.
Other international organizations, such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, NonAlignment Movement, OSCE, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and European Parliament adopted similar decisions and resolutions. Armenia doesn't implement them. Armenia for 24 years ignores UN Security Council resolutions and unfortunately is not punished
1

for that. In some cases, UN Security Council resolutions are implemented within days. In our case it's 24 years that resolutions are not implemented. This is a double standards approach. This approach is unacceptable. International sanctions must be imposed on Armenia. One of the important reforms of the United Nations must be the creation of the mechanism of implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council.
Armenia does everything to keep status-quo unchanged, blocks substantive negotiations. Cochairs of the OSCE Minsk Group France, Russia, USA  on several occasions stated that statusquo is unacceptable.
The question is how can this corrupt, failed state ruled by despotic, medieval regime afford to violate international law for so many years and ignore the resolutions of UN Security Council and statements of the leading countries of the world? And the answer is double standards. There is no international pressure on aggressor, no international sanctions imposed on Armenian dictatorship. This policy must be stopped.
Such policy towards aggressor is not only demonstration of injustice, it also creates an illusion that Armenian dictatorship can continue their policy of terror.
Last April Armenia committed another war crime on the line of contact attacking our cities and villages. As a result of this attack, 6 Azerbaijani civilians were killed, among them one child and 26 civilians were wounded. Hundreds of our houses were destroyed.
Azerbaijan had to defend its citizens. As a result of successful counter-attack, Azerbaijan liberated some territories in the 3 occupied regions - Agdere, Fuzuli and Jabrayil and installed its national flag on the liberated territories. Armenian leadership should not forget this lesson. Otherwise, the result of the next Armenian provocation will be more painful for them.
Losing on the battlefield Armenia uses its mean policy of attacking our cities and villages. On July 4, 2017 a targeted attack on Alkhanli village in Fuzuli district by Armenia with 82 and 120 mm mortars and grenade launchers killed 2 civilians  2 years old Zahra Guliyeva and her grandmother.
On August 7, 2017, a 13 years old boy in Tovuz region bordering with Armenia was wounded by Armenian soldiers. International community must stop Armenian fascism and terror. Azerbaijan is committed to peaceful resolution of the conflict but at the same time will defend its citizens in line with UN charter if Armenian military provocations continue and if necessary will punish once again the aggressor as it was done in April, 2016.
Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict must be resolved on the basis of international law, relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Territorial integrity of Azerbaijan must be completely restored. Despite the enormous difficulties caused by Armenian occupation Azerbaijan develops rapidly and successfully.
2

Azerbaijan is an active member of the United Nations.
In 2011, Azerbaijan was elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. 155 countries voted for Azerbaijan. Absolute majority of the member states demonstrated their support to Azerbaijan and its policy. For the country which at that time was only 20 years old, that was a great success. Azerbaijan is a stable, modern, democratic country. Development of democracy, human rights protection are among top priorities of our government. All fundamental freedoms are fully provided in Azerbaijan, including freedom of expression, media freedom, freedom of assembly, religious freedom.
Azerbaijan is one of the world's recognized centers of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is a state policy in Azerbaijan. Representatives of all ethnic groups and religions live in Azerbaijan in peace and harmony. 2016 was declared the year of multiculturalism and 2017 the year of Islamic Solidarity in Azerbaijan.
Unlike Armenia where there are almost no national minorities, which is a mono ethnic country and where xenophobia is a state policy, Azerbaijan is a multiethnic country, cultural, ethnic and religious diversity of our society is our big asset. Armenia, where Islamophobia reached its peak, committed many acts of vandalism destroying all our mosques on the occupied territories.
Azerbaijan had hosted numerous international events aiming at strengthening interreligious dialogue. Among them are 7th Global Forum of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, World's Religious Leaders Forum, 4 times international forum on Intercultural Dialogue, 5 times Baku International Humanitarian Forum and other important events.
Being a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan in 2008 launched the Baku Process which is supported by the United Nations. Main goal of the Baku Process is to strengthen dialogue, partnership and cooperation between the Muslim world and Europe.
In 2015, Azerbaijan hosted the First European Games. 6000 athletes from 50 countries participated at these Games. In 2017, Azerbaijan hosted 4th Islamic Solidarity Games with almost 3000 athletes from 54 countries.
In two years in our capital Baku European and Islamic Games took place. This was also a great contribution to the promotion of multiculturalism. Azerbaijani team took the second place at the First European Games, and the first place at the Islamic Solidarity Games. This shows that Azerbaijan is one of the leading sporting countries of the world. Another proof of our sporting achievement is that Azerbaijan was number 14 at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games with respect to the number of medals. In total, Azerbaijan won 18 medals.
Azerbaijan achieved big progress in social and economic development.
Since 2004, Azerbaijan's economy grew more than 3 times. More than 1 million 600 thousand jobs were created in our country. Level of unemployment is one of the lowest in the world  5%. One of our priorities was reduction of poverty. In 2004, level of poverty was more than 40%, now it is 5-6%. Hard currency reserves are equal to the country's GDP. Foreign state debt is less than 20% of GDP.
3

Azerbaijan was assessed as ""leading reformer of the world"" in 2009 by the World Bank's Doing Business report. Based on Davos World Economic Forum ""Global Competitiveness Report for 2016-2017"" Azerbaijan is ranked 37 among 138 countries.
In 2015, Azerbaijan received the 2015 South-South Award in recognition of its outstanding achievements in implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and since 2010 has been classified into the category of countries with high human development.
Rapid development of Azerbaijan's space industry, 2 telecommunication and field observation satellites ""Azerspace"" and ""Azersky"" and a third one ""Azerspace-2"" to be launched soon  made it possible for our country to become a member of the world's space club.
Today Azerbaijan exports not only its industrial and agricultural but also intellectual products. ""State Agency for Services and Social Innovations to the Citizens"" - ASAN Service is a modern model of public relations and services.
251 services under one roof, absolute transparency, zero tolerance to corruption and bribery made ""ASAN Service"" attractive to many countries.
Being purely Azerbaijani brand during 5 years of its foundation ASAN Service provided over 1 million 600 thousand services to 5 million people. The total number of applications is 17 million. The rate of public appreciation of ""ASAN Service"" is 98 %.
In 2015, in recognition of its contribution to excellence, creativity and considerable simplification of the delivery of public services, ASAN received the United Nations Public Service Award.
Main goal of our policy is to make the life of our citizens better. Since 2004 salaries grew in our country 5.6 times, pensions 8.2 times.
Without any foreign financial support, we built almost 100 new settlements and towns for refugees and IDPs suffering from Armenian occupation. Until today, the living conditions of more than 250 thousand people were improved and they were provided with new houses and flats. 152 schools, 59 medical centers, 60 kindergartens were built in these towns and settlements.
In general, since 2004 more than 3000 schools, more than 600 hospitals and medical centers were newly built and renovated. Level of literacy in Azerbaijan is close to 100%. Every year more than 5 million people  half of the country's population  get their medical check-up totally financed by the state budget.
Azerbaijan plays an important role on the global energy market. Being a reliable supplier of oil and gas to the international markets - Azerbaijan is providing energy security for many countries of the world. Today, Azerbaijan together with its international partners is very close to the completion of the ""Southern Gas Corridor"" project. This project of 40 billion USD of investments is one of the largest infrastructure projects of the world.
4

Another important priority is transportation. Situated between Europe and Asia, Azerbaijan is wisely using its geographical location to become one of the leading transportation hubs in Eurasia. Relatively recently Azerbaijan built 6 international airports, 11,000 kilometers of modern highways and roads. Azerbaijan has the biggest trade fleet in the Caspian Sea with 270 vessels. Modern shipbuilding yard of Azerbaijan is capable to build all types and sizes of ships. Azerbaijan is modernizing its railroad infrastructure. Absolute majority of our territory is covered by railroads. Next year we will inaugurate the international trade sea port which will be the biggest in the Caspian region. Azerbaijan is largely investing in East-West and North-South transportation corridors. Both routes crossing our country will be the shortest routes from East to West and from North to the South. In conclusion, I would like to say that last year we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the restoration of our independence. Successful development of Azerbaijan once again shows that only when you are free and independent, when the destiny of the country is in the hands of its people you can achieve success. The biggest happiness of the people of Azerbaijan is that we live in the independent country which conducts independent policy, policy which is based on the national interests of its people.
Thank you.

Bahamas,"Mr. President,
On behalf of the people and Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, I congratulate you on your election as President of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly, and I assure you of my country's full support and co-operation during your tenure.
I also extend sincere congratulations to your predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson, for his leadership of the Assembly during the 71st Session.
The Bahamas congratulates His Excellency Antonio Guterres on his election as the newest Secretary-General of the United Nations.
He has the daunting task of continuing the implementation of the bold and ambitious Agenda 2030.
I commend him on the work he has done to date in steering the work of the organisation, and wish to assure him of the full support of The Bahamas.
Mr. President,
In the time since the 29th of September 1729, when the first meeting of the Parliament of The Bahamas took place, democratic values have taken deep root throughout the archipelago.
On the 10th of May 2017, The Bahamas conducted its eleventh consecutive round of General Elections since attaining universal suffrage in 1962.
The people of The Bahamas, in a free, peaceful and democratic process, elected a new Government, led by Dr. the Honourable Hubert Minnis.
The new administration is one made up almost exclusively of new members  one as young as 21 years of age. We promised our people bold change, and we are committed to the fulfillment of what we have promised.
We stand on the threshold of advancing a new agenda, as demanded by our people; one that has, at its core, the protection and promotion of the rights, interests and welfare of all Bahamians  women, men, young people and children. I am, therefore, proud today to make my first address to this august body as the most recently-appointed Foreign Minister of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas under this new Administration.
Mr. President,
Economies large and small are facing very difficult times, where myriad factors challenge our capacity to create an environment where people can be assured of sustainable livelihoods, security and safety, and a promising future for succeeding generations.
1

Very troubling are the insidious increase in international terrorism; unfair practices in the international financial sector, such as de-risking and correspondent banking; illicit crime; trafficking in persons; drug trafficking; trafficking in weapons; gross violations of human rights; and reprehensible corruption by those who have been entrusted to govern.
Especially of concern for small island developing states are the dangers of environmental degradation and climate change, which threaten our very survivability. With what we have witnessed just recently with the passage of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and now Maria, I cannot underscore sufficiently the importance The Bahamas attaches to combating climate change, and the preservation and protection of the environment.
Even while these Hurricanes were occurring, there have been earthquakes in Mexico, resulting in further tragic loss of life and destruction.
Climate change is global.
We have expressed before, and today we reiterate, our thoughts and prayers to all adversely impacted by these devastating events.
Mr. President,
I need to emphasise that this is the third time in three years The Bahamas has been hit by a major hurricane and Maria is still churning in our territory.
There are two more months before the end of the hurricane season, and we can only pray that we will be spared from further destruction and loss.
Hurricane Irma changed course and did not directly hit the entire Bahamian archipelago, thus minimizing the impact on our tourism industry. However, we were not entirely spared.
Our southern islands experienced serious damage, Ragged Island was totally devastated and is now uninhabitable. Additionally, tornadoes inflicted considerable damage on the northern islands of Bimini and Grand Bahama.
We are grateful to our international partners who provided immediate support after the passage of Hurricane Irma, and now continue to stand by our side as we begin the painful and burdensome process of restoration and rebuilding. I commend you, Mr. President, and the Secretary-General for convening the recent High-Level Meeting to allow those of us impacted to bring focus on these events to other potential partners.
One of the countries immediately affected by Hurricane Irma was the Republic of Cuba, which, as on previous occasions, caused this massive hurricane to lose some of its energy and probably led to a lesser impact on our neighbour, the United States of America. All developing countries affected have been placed on a short-list for assistance to shore up their internal conditions towards recovery.
2

Cuba does not enjoy this capacity to the fullest. The Bahamas joins other nations in calling for the Congress of the United States to reconsider the legislative barriers to the biggest of the Caribbean islands in order for it to develop to its fullest potential as a member of the international community.
Mr. President,
Hence, it is the intention of the Government, working with the private sector, to create out of the destruction of Ragged Island the first fully green island in the region, utilising renewable energy and smart technologies from solar energy to sustainable water purification systems to create a more sustainable, resilient, island community.
The implications for the existence of SIDS like The Bahamas, as we are confronted with global warming, rising sea-levels, and more severe and frequent hurricanes and other extreme weather events, are all too clear. For the first time in its history, The Bahamas evacuated whole communities to safe quadrants ahead of Hurricane Irma. What's next: wholesale evacuation of the entire Caribbean?
I call on the international community to recognise the imperative of accelerating the efforts to deal urgently with the adverse impact of climate change and to do so in a co-ordinated way.
Only then will we mitigate against these ferocious and frequent destructive weather events, which now potentially threatens to add to the world's migration issues.
Mr. President,
Well over two decades ago, my Government, recognising the very real threat posed to our very existence, upgraded its human capital capacity to address the unintended consequences of climate change, as well as its commitment to environmental conservation.
Through its many marine protected areas, The Bahamas is committed to the conservation of sustainable oceans, as well as through our active involvement in initiatives such as 10X20, and our participation in the consultative process of Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction.
In this context, The Bahamas has presented its candidature once again for a seat on the Council of the International Maritime Organisation in Category ""C"".
Mr. President,
The continuing imperative for us in The Bahamas and the Caribbean, is the re-evaluation of the measurements used to determine economic well-being.
The IMF in its Policy Brief on ""Vulnerability and Debt in Small States"" recognised that ""Many [SIDS] face an uncertain future.""
3

The Bahamas continues to dispute the use of Per Capita GDP/GNP as an instrument to measure wealth and economic development.
The use of this one-dimensional instrument prohibits countries that are most in need to receive development assistance or loans at concessional rates. It is time for us to replace that metric with a realistic measurement that takes into account the vulnerability and fragility of SIDS to exogenous shocks.
Mr. President,
Notwithstanding our best efforts at self-sufficiency, exogenous shocks, in the form of reduced correspondent banking relationships, continue to create challenges for the region.
International banking institutions, fearing that they may be subject to fines and sanctions related to illicit activities of money laundering and terrorist financing, have pulled out en masse.
Citizens in our region depend of the services provided by these entities, and have now become severely disadvantaged as a result of the actions taken.
This threatens our ability to remain competitive as one of the leading international centres and hinders our efforts to expand our trading relationships.
The Head of the IMF, Ms. Christine Lagarde, spoke convincingly in 2016 on the subject of correspondent banking, highlighting that all stakeholders had to uphold their end of the bargain.
For its part, The Bahamas has invested in a strong compliance regime, at great financial costs. We invite the international community to work together to find another way to deal with the issue and allow input from those to be impacted by their decisions before moving the goalposts again.
Despite the challenges faced, the Government of The Bahamas remains committed to a comprehensive development agenda for the country. With the launch of the National Development Plan Vision 2040 in the coming months, we will set a course towards the achievement of the SDGs.
In this connection, The Bahamas has committed to participating in the Voluntary National Review process at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council in 2018.
We appreciate the support of the UNDP and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in this regard. Indeed, it is through this anticipated integrated framework that we address the range of challenges that face our nation.
Mr. President, 4

The scourges of terrorism and trafficking in arms of all types continue to impact our way of life. The Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to stand with the international community in fighting terrorism in all its forms.
We also stand in solidarity with the peoples of France, Spain, Belgium and the United Kingdom who have recently experienced horrific terrorist attacks.
Violence in the furtherance of ""political"" aims is never the answer. Only through dialogue and negotiations will aspirations be realised.
Mr. President,
I spoke earlier about the importance of accountability, truth and transparency in government and the rule of law to good governance. It has been said that,
""Corruption is a global phenomenon found in all countries  but evidence shows it harms poor people more than others, stifles economic growth and diverts desperately needed funds from education, healthcare and other public services. An estimated one trillion US dollars get siphoned off through bribes every year according to the World Bank.""
The Government of The Bahamas has firmly committed itself to eradicating corruption. We are resolved to have in place an efficient, results-based public sector, with an Office of the Ombudsman, in order to create the best environment possible to promote economic development, foreign direct investment, small business development and equal opportunity for all to share in prosperity.
Mr. President,
The role of the United Nations in advancing human rights has been essential.
The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a series of international instruments, human rights operations on the ground, and the various human rights bodies, such as the Human Rights Council, permit the United Nations to continue as a beacon to promote and protect human rights through both immediate and long-term action.
In The Bahamas, we are committed to protecting and promoting the rights of all Bahamians, and, indeed, all human kind. The achievements of The Bahamas relative to human rights have derived from collaboration with all stakeholders, and a willingness to explore fresh approaches to longstanding challenges.
Within this context, I am pleased to announce that The Bahamas is seeking election to the Human Rights Council for the term 2019-2021. As a member of the Council, as a SIDs, The Bahamas will bring to that body a fresh, distinct and constructive perspective, with the potential to add depth and richness to human rights advancement and discourse.
5

Mr. President,
The Government of the Bahamas believes that education must be at the heart of driving sustainable development, where we build resilience and an educated, inclusive and diverse workforce and community. This has positive implications for creativity, innovation and productivity that allow learners and youth to fulfill the potential to act as agents of social change.
For this reason, our Government has designed an Education Agenda, which encourages lifelong learning and recognises the potential of technology and digital platforms to serve as tools in the teaching and learning process.
I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the Assembly that The Bahamas, in recognition of the invaluable role of technology and communications in education and all aspects of development, has presented its candidature for a seat on the Council of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
Mr. President,
The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted in September 2016 by the General Assembly, called for the development of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.
We commend the ongoing work in preparation for the global compact. While recognising the potential yields of global migration relative to the reduction of poverty and global inequality, we believe that proper co-operation, through the appropriate mechanisms, can help to ensure that migration occurs through safe and regulated channels, to the benefit of all involved countries.
Mr. President,
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognises non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as a major challenge for sustainable development. The UN General Assembly's third High-Level Review Meeting on NCDs in 2018 will provide the opportunity for a renewed political commitment to take concrete actions to address the challenge of NCDs as a matter of priority, including sustained engagement at a high-level to co-ordinate on strategies to achieve targets and to mobilise necessary financing.
We also recognise the successes experienced in global AIDS response, and caution the international community, at this important juncture, to resist complacency and continue to offer support to achieve targets and to sustain the Joint Programme relative to HIV/AIDS.
Mr. President,
6

The Bahamas supports the work of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department under which it falls, as a fundamental instrument to build, protect and maintain peace and security within the United Nations. We note the approach of the termination of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and the establishment of the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. As was the case with MINUSTAH, The Bahamas looks forward to doing its part to support Haiti's continued national development. We also enjoin the continued support and engagement of the international community in Haiti. Mr. President, During the main session, the General Assembly will consider and approve the ProgrammeBudget for the biennium 2018-2019.
It is our expectation that the General Assembly will, in a transparent and constructive manner, approve a budget that aligns with the mandates and activities of the United Nations. We welcome the Secretary-General's initial efforts to promote management reform aimed at strengthening service delivery. We encourage the Secretary-General, in the execution of the budget, to continue to find innovative means to advance an efficient implementation of mandates, but without arbitrary cuts. Mr. President, The Bahamas values the role of the United Nations as the custodian of the interests of the world's people, in particular the poor and the vulnerable. We believe that the United Nations Charter remains a viable and firm foundation onto which global peace and security, social progress and economic development can be built. I thank you.

Bangladesh,"Mr. President,

Bismiilahir Rahmanir Rahim

As-salamu alaikum and good afternoon.
Let me extend my hem-tiest felicitations on your election as President of the 72nd session of the General Assembly. My delegation assures you of our full support in discharging your priorities on people, peace and planet.
Mr. President,
This is the 14th time I am addressing the 10N General Assembly. And this time I have come here with a heavy heart. I have come here just after seeing the hungry, distressed and hopeless Rohingyas fi'om Myanmar who took shelter in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. This forcibly displaced people of Myanlnar are fleeing an 'ethnic cleansing' in their own country where they have been living for centuries.
I can feel their pain as I, along with my younger sister, had been a refugee for 6 years after my father, the Father of the Nation of Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheilch Muiibur Rahman and almost all members of my family were assassinated in 1975.
In 1974, in the first ever address of Bangladesh in this Assembly, my father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman said, ""I know that the souls of our martyrs join us in pledging that the Bengalee nation fully commits itself to the building of a world order in which the aspirations of all men for peace and justice will be realized"".
Mr. President,

We m'e currently sheltering over 800,000 forcibly displaced Rohingyas from Myanmar. The ongoing atrocities and human rights violations in the Rakhine State of Myanmar once again aggravated the situation at the Bangladesh-Myanmar Border. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas from the Raldine State are entering Bangladesh to flee violence. As estimated by IOM, in last three weeks over four hundred thirty thousand Rohingyas entered Bangladesh. We are horrified to see that the Myanmm"" authorities are laying landmines along their stretch of the border to prevent the Ronhingyas from returning to Myanmar, This people must be able to return to their homeland in safety, secm'ity and dignity.

At the same time, i condemn all kinds ofterrorisln and violent extremism too. Our government maintains a 'zero tolerance' policy in this regard.

I thank the members of the Security Council and also the Secretary General for their proactive attempts to stop atrocities and bring in peace, and stability in the Rakhine State of Myanmnar.

1 further call upon the United Nations and the international community to take immediate and effective measures for a permanent solution to this protracted Rohingya crisis. In this regard, I propose the following actions:

First: Myanmar must unconditionally stop the violence and the practice of ethnic cleansing in the Rakhine State immediately and forever.

Second: Secretm-y General of the United Nations should immediately send a Fact-Finding Mission to Myanmar.

Third: All civilians in-espective of religion and ethnicity must be protected in Myanmar. For that ""safe zones"" could be created inside Myanmar under UN supervision.

Fourth: Ensure sustainable return of all forcibly displaced Rohingyas in Bangladesh to their homes in Myanmar.

Fifth: The recommendations of Kofi Annan Commission Report must be immediately implemented unconditionally and in its entirety.

Mr. President,
In the 1971 war of liberation, we endured an extreme form of genocide. In the 9-month-long war of liberation against Pakistan 3 million innocent people were killed and more than 200,000 women were violated. The Pakistan military launched the heinous 'operation searchlight' on 25th March which was the beginning of the 1971 genocide.
The 1971 genocide included targeted elimination of individuals on the ground of religion, race and political belief. The intellectuals were killed brutally. To pay homage to the victims of the genocide, our national parliament has recently declared 25th Mm-ch as ""Genocide Day.""
In Bangladesh, we have already undertaken the daunting task of bringing the key perpetrators to justice through the International Crimes Tribunal. I urge the international community to take collective actions to prevent recurrence of such heinous crimes anywhere anytime. I believe, recognition of past tragedies like the 1971 genocide would guide us to achieve 'never again'.
Mr. President,
Since our birth as a nation, we have pursued peace-centric domestic and foreign policies. With that spirit, Bangladesh has been taking the lead in tabling the resolution on ""Culture of Peace"" every year in the General Assembly since 2000.
We reaffirm the call for resuming the Middle East Peace Process, and for ending all forms of hostilities and discriminations against the brotherly Palestinian people.
In recognition of the potential role of the UN peacebuilding architecture, we look forward to bold and innovative proposals from the Secretary General on financing for 'sustaining peace'. 1 am pleased to announce a token contribution of USD 100,000 from Bangladesh for the UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF).
Mr. President,
As a major troop and police contributing country Bangladesh underscores the importance of upholding effectiveness and credibility of UN peacekeeping operations. We shall maintain our own capability readiness, remain open to further smart pledges, enhance the scope of our peacekeeping training, and deploy more female peacekeepers.
We maintain a 'zero tolerance' approach to any allegation of sexual exploitation and abuse. As an endorser of the ""'Voluntary Compact"" on Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, I have committed myself to the Secretary General's ""Circle of Leadership"" to combat this scourge. I am also pleased to announce a token contribution of USD 100,000 to the Victim Support Fund established for this purpose.
Mr. President,
Terrorism and violent extremism have become a major threat to peace, stability and development. Terrorists have no religion, belief or race. Having been a target of a number of terrorist attacks myself, I personally empathize with the victims of terrorism and appreciate their need for protection.
We denounce the use of religion to justify violent extremism. I have involved families, women, the youth, the media and religious leaders at the community level to offset the spread of violent extremism. In this regard, I reiterate my calls:
First, stop supplying arms to the terrorists; Second, stop terrorist financing; and Third, settle all international disputes peacefully.
l also urge the UN to address the growing threats emanated from the cyber space to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other transnational organized crimes.

Mr. President,
We believe in promoting safe, orderly and regular migration. Last year we proposed developing a sound migration governance framework through the ""Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration"". I am pleased that currently the UN is delivering on the formation of the compacts for migration and refugees. Mr. President,
The Paris Climate Agreement remains our bastion ol"" hope for climate justice. By recognizing the climate vulnerability, we are building resilience against the grave impacts of climate change. We believe in the potentials of'Blue Economy"" in advancing the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and seas.
Bangladesh has achieved exemplary success in building resilience against flood and other disasters. Crop intensification and invention of water resistant crops have helped us achieve self sufficiency in food. We have efficiently responded to the massive flood that has stricken the entire south Asian region this yem-.
As a member of the High-level Panel on Water, I attach high priority to implementing its comprehensive Action Plan. Bangladesh has ensured access to safe water for 87 per cent of its population by 2015, and we aim full coverage o four population by 2030.
Mr. President,
We believe that there are close interfaces between peace & stability and development. We share the conviction that addressing poverty, hunger, illiteracy, unemployment and inequalities is crucial for building peaceful, just and inclusive societies.
We are committed to implement the SDGs. For that, ore"" Government has adopted a 'whole-of-the-society' approach. The SDGs complement our vision to transform Bangladesh into a middle-income country by 202l and a developed one by 2041.
Even before the adoption of the SDGs we have initiated unique social programmes that reflect the themes of the SDGs, such as Ekti Bari Ekti Khamm- (One Household One Farm); Community Clinic; Ashrayan (Shelter project); Digital Bangladesh; Education Support; Women Empowerment; Education for All; Social Safety Net; Environment Protection and Investment and Development.
Our ""Voluntary National Review"" presented to the UN this year showcased our progress and commitment for achieving the SDGs.
Mr. President,
In 2016-17, Bangladesh's economy posted a GDP growth rate of over 7.24% and our foreign cun'ency reserve reached USD 32.1 billion. We have brought down the poverty level fi'om 56.7% in 1991 to 23.2% today.
Our per capita income is expected to grow to USD 1,602 by the end of the current fiscal year, which was only USD 543 in the FY 2005-06. Our life expectancy increased to almost 72 years. These figures, indeed, are indications of our inclusive development, in which no citizen is left behind.
To ensure inclusive growth, promote investment and employment opportunities for all, we have taken an initiative to develop 100 special economic zones around the country.
Our extensive social safety net measures give coverage to many vulnerable segments of our population, including elderly people, persons with disabilities, victims of domestic violence, and vulnerable mothers under economic hardship.
Special emphasis has been given to unlock the potentials of physically challenged children and people. 103 service and care centres along with 32 mobile therapy vans attend to the needs of persons with disabilities, including those affected by Autism. 18,500 community health clinics are being complemented by medical services tba'ough mobile phones and web cameras in districts and upazilas (sub-districts).

There is now a public primary school in every village of the country. 38,331 educational institutions have been equipped with digital laboratories and multi-media classrooms. Special emphasis is being given on promoting technical and vocational education and training for young people.
Mr. President,
Our youth are the main movers in realizing my vision for a knowledge-based 'Digital Bangladesh'. We are working towards creating an environment to allow them to pro'sue transformative education, find decent jobs, and turn into truly global citizens.
I am happy to announce that Bangabandhu Statelllte-1, which is our first ever satellite, is scheduled to be launched this year on our victory day 16th December.
Mr. President,
To conclude, I would like to say, we do not want war. We want peace. We want people's wellbeing - not destruction of humanity. We want sustainable development. Let this be our collective goal.
I thank you.
Khoda Hafez Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu Long Live Bangladesh"
Barbados,"Mr. President, On behalf of my delegation, I congratulate you on your election to the Presidency of the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly. Please be assured that you have the full support and cooperation of the Barbados delegation as you undertake your important duties as President of this august body.
I also take this opportunity to commend your predecessor, H.E. Mr. Peter Thomson, for his able leadership of the 71st session. He has served as a worthy example of the valuable contribution which Small Island Developing States (SIDS) can make to international organisations. Barbados is pleased that he will continue to serve the international community.
Mr. President, The theme of this year's General Debate, 'Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for aft on a sustainable planet', serves as
a reminder of the purposes and principles that the United Nations has embraced from its inception and which are enshrined in its Charter. It brings into sharp focus our responsibility to pursue the best interests of the people who occupy planet earth. For if we fail to advance the causes of security, sustainable development and human rights together neither
will succeed.
Mr. President, I stand before this august body for the eighth time. On each occasion that I have addressed the nations gathered here, I cautioned about the ramifications of unchecked climate change. I highlighted the existential threat faced by vulnerable Small Island Developing States such as Barbados.

In his first address to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2008, the Prime Minister of Barbados, the late David Thompson described the Caribbean as ""A region at the epicenter of the global climate crisis."" Citing scientific evidence and devastating impacts of climate change which were already evident in the region, he told the General Assembly that ""failure to take urgent, ambitious and decisive action would be nothing short of reckless indifference"".
Seven years later the Prime Minister of Barbados, the Right Honourable Freundel Stuart reminded the world that: ""None of the nations represented in this Assembly will enjoy sustainable prosperity if we continue to abuse the environment which we hold in sacred trust for future generations ...... The very existence of small island states like those in the Caribbean and the Pacific could be imperiled if current trends are not halted or
re vers e d.""
I have heard many other leaders from small island developing states consistently warn of the inherent danger to lives, livelihoods and the very existence of sovereign nations of inaction or insufficient action to reduce global emissions and provide support for resilience building in vulnerable countries. Year after year our leaders warned of the escalating costs of responding to climate impacts and that decades of development gains could easily be washed away in a few hours from an extreme weather event. They also warned of the persistent and frustrating challenge our region faced in accessing resources to strengthen our resilience and to protect our peoples from the ravages of climate change owing to a narrow

focus on per capita income by donors and international development banks and agencies.
This clarion call from the Caribbean was ignored.
Today, we bear witness to the results of this act of reckless indifference.
Today, I regret that I must report, not on a potential threat, but rather on the destructive impact of climate change on the globe. I speak most specifically of the utter devastation being visited on several Small Island Developing States in the Caribbean overwhelmed by an unprecedented wave of hurricanes.
On Saturday, September 16th when I arrived in New York, the people of Antigua and Barbuda and in the Caribbean we were working feverishly to restore some semblance of order to the islands shattered by Irma, the ninth named hurricane of the 2017 season. A mere two days later, in the early hours of Monday, I read with horror the pleas of the Prime Minister of Dominica as he reached out to the world to share the trauma he was experiencing as his small island was ravaged by the brutal force of nature from the 11th hurricane in a season which has not yet ended. Barbados, by the grace of God has so far been spared but we in the Caribbean are one family; we are brothers and sisters and when one of us hurts we all feel the pain.

i ; ; : 4
For much of the Caribbean, tourism is the major economic sector. This has been built on offering to the world a zone of peace and health. The threat of disease must be avoided. One possible consequence of the recent floods and serious infrastructural damage in the region is the outbreak of diseases. Our ability to detect and respond to such biological threats must be strengthened. There must be bilateral and multilateral cooperation to minimise and indeed eliminate such threats. A focus on Bio-security must be part of our response. There must be attention paid to a global health security agenda. As an island state, the Ocean is a priority for Barbados. Ocean governance and the promotion and conservation of marine resources is therefore one of our primary
concerns.
The road to recovery and reconstruction for Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica and the other islands affected by this year's devastating hurricane season will be long and difficult. I take comfort in the spirit, will and determination of Caribbean people. We are down but not defeated.
Our neighbours in the Caribbean affected by the recent hurricanes can be assured of the full and unconditional support and solidarity of the Government and people of Barbados.
However, our friends in the international community must accompany the Caribbean region on this journey to rebuild Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and the other affected islands. We are all morally obligated to

do so. In this regard, I call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the World Bank to convene an International Pledging Conference on the Recovery and Reconstruction of the Caribbean Islands affected by the Hurricanes Irma and Maria. I urge all member states to support the recovery and rebuilding of the Caribbean.
Mr. President, For Barbados and other SIDS, whether in the Caribbean, the Pacific, Asia or Africa, climate change is a matter of life or death. It is not an issue for sterile debates and endless meetings. For our people, it is about loss of life and livelihood. For our economies, heavily dependent on tourism, it is about a cycle of constant recovery and rebuilding which is a serious impediment to sustainable development.
Barbados remains committed to ambitious action on climate change. We continue to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and view the Secretary General's Climate Summit in 2019 as an important opportunity to take stock and to give additional impetus where necessary.
Barbados' support for global climate change action is a component of its overall policy of promoting and protecting the environment. We have taken concrete steps to build a resource-efficient green economy, which is integrated into our national framework for sustainable development.
Mr. President,
Barbados takes this opportunity to convey its solidarity with the Government and people of Mexico suffering the painful effects of two deadly earthquakes in quick succession.

PEACE
A key element of this year's theme is Striving for Peace. Barbados is a democratic, peace-loving nation. Last year, my country celebrated its 50th anniversary of Independence gained, after negotiation and mutual agreement. We cherish and nurture our political and social stability, based on our history of over 375 years of unbroken Parliamentary Government. We believe that peace is an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable human, social and economic development. For us, it is an essential pillar supporting the national mission of the Government of Barbados - sustainable economic and social development for the nation, protecting the environment, maintaining good governance and strengthening citizen security.
We are committed to inclusive development as a means of achieving lasting peace and stability at the national and international levels. We regret that there can be no peace of mind for the people of the Caribbean who must rebuild their homes and their livelihoods.
But the Mission of the United Nations is to secure global peace. We were reminded by the Secretary General at the very start of our deliberations that ""We are a world in pieces. We need to be a world at peace."" So each and every member of this international community has an obligation to support efforts and take action to create an environment in which peace can flourish. The countries of Latin America and Caribbean have declared the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace. I use this opportunity to express the unwavering support of Barbados for the protection and preservation of the territorial integrity of our sister CARICOM countries of Guyana and Belize.

Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet
Mr. President,
Barbados joins with other UN Member States in the effort to address collectively the many other diverse challenges to which the international community must find and implement solutions.
In the last few years, the countries represented here have made historic international commitments. These include the SAMOA Pathway, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
As an international community, we must now take action to implement these commitments, if the destruction referenced earlier in my statement, is to be addressed.
In recognition that our citizens are our most precious resource, we have resolutely taken a path to development that is people-centred.
Our national policy framework aligns naturally with the philosophy guiding the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This has facilitated our implementation efforts. The Prime Minister of Barbados has clearly demonstrated the priority which Barbados accords to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. He has appointed a Permanent Secretary in his office with the mandate and special responsibility to lead the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the national level.

Mr. President, Barbados has been a consistent and vocal advocate for the treatment of SIDS as a special case for sustainable development because of their inherent natural vulnerabilities. There is a pressing need for the international community to address the specific needs and interests of SIDS in a holistic manner. Effective partnerships on a multi-sectoral basis are also required to assist them in implementing the SDGs.
Mr. President, Barbados welcomes the on-going efforts of the UN to focus international attention on the challenges facing our oceans and the need for the international community to take meaningful steps to protect the marine environment.
I was pleased to head the Barbados delegation to the UN Oceans Conference in June this year and I commit to ensuring the continued active participation of Barbados on this issue. Barbados signals its interest in working with UN agencies and other international partners to develop an Oceans economy trade strategy, as well as effective systems
to manage our fish stocks.
Mr. President, Barbados has built an enviable record on the basis of its promotion of social development. Since independence, successive administrations
have committed to a targeted social policy focusing on the people of Barbados. Substantial investment has been made in sectors such as education and health, in order to develop a skilled, healthy and productive population.

,    19
The result of this investment has been a significant improvement in the quality of life of Barbadians over the years. This is borne out in the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index and other indices focusing on transparency, corruption, gender balance and human rights inter alia.
The promotion and protection of the human rights of all Barbadians is a primary concern of the Government of Barbados. This is in keeping with our commitment to a human rights-based approach to development, and with our adherence to the principles of good governance, the rule of law and ensuring that our people have the highest levels of civil, political,
economic, social and cultural rights.
We pay special attention to the rights of the vulnerable, including children, women, and persons with disabilities. With respect to the rights of persons with disabilities, Government, working together with civil society, continues to make progress in promoting full integration into mainstream society.
Barbados wishes to participate more fully in the international community on issues of inclusiveness. We are pleased, therefore, to present the candidature of Her Honour Senator Kerryann Ifill for membership of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), for the term 2019-2022. She is the youngest President of the Senate ever appointed in Barbados, the first female and the first person with a disability ever to hold that position. Senator Ifill's candidature has been endorsed by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

; ;' 1 10
Mr. President,
The Caribbean Community has been in the forefront of initiatives at the United Nations to address the problem of non-communicable diseases.
During this session, Barbados will work with regional and other partners to bring greater focus to the growing challenge of childhood obesity, a serious problem which could become the next major development challenge.
Barbados looks forward to the convening of the Third UN Conference on NCDs, scheduled for next year. I encourage Member States to participate actively in this Conference. It presents an invaluable opportunity to strengthen our action on this important issue and to move closer to our goal of improved health for our people.
Mr. President, Barbados takes this opportunity to express once again its deep concern at being penalised for any success that it achieves in its development
efforts. Its categorisation as a Middle Income Country with the resulting restriction in access to international development assistance and concessionary financing is unfair and does nothing to advance the cause of sustainable development. We reiterate our call on the international community to create an enabling global environment and partnership for development. Countries such as mine require assistance in building economic resilience not challenges such as de-risking, black listing and indebtedness.

Mr. President, Transnational crime constitutes one of the major threats to international peace and security. It can take many forms - trafficking in illegal drugs, trafficking in persons, the illegal transfer of small arms and light weapons as well as money laundering. These all present significant threats to the security of Barbados.
Barbados reiterates its commitment to protecting the security of its people. We will remain actively engaged in cooperative mechanisms seeking to confront and address these challenges.
Barbados welcomes the convening of the Third Conference of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). We encourage all States Parties to take action to implement the Treaty. We further acknowledge the nexus between the ATT and the SDGs and their contribution to the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies.
Mr. President, The long-standing economic embargo on Cuba continues to be cause of serious concern for Barbados. We join with the overwhelming majority of UN Member States in opposing this unilateral action and encourage constructive engagement between the two sides.
Mr. President, In conclusion, allow me to reiterate Barbados' unwavering commitment to
the United Nations and to the principle of multilateralism. If we are truly committed to a decent life for all people everywhere must have be heard. That includes those in small states such as Barbados.

Barbados agrees that there is the need for reform in the UN System. However, even as the United Nations undergoes reform to better equip itself to respond to today's global challenges, due care must be taken to ensure that the process is inclusive and transparent. No Member State, particularly the most vulnerable, must be excluded in the restructuring
process.
Barbados supports the view that a spirit of cooperation and dialogue should be the foundation for our interaction at the multilateral level. Cooperation and dialogue represent the best means of achieving our international goals and objectives.
I thank you."
Belarus,"Mr. President,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The past few decades have been fraught with two contradictory tendencies  enhanced political fragmentation and increased economic globalization.
The first tendency has been associated with global political instability. It resulted from wars, conflicts, terrorism, xenophobia and other factors. It gives rise to the feeling of a mounting chaos and despondency.
Why have we found ourselves in this predicament?
Because we failed to put an end to the last epochal conflict  the Cold War.
It did not end up with a peace treaty as had usually been the case with all other previous major wars. Therefore, we were left without a universally accepted framework, which could have guided our subsequent behavior.
Different powers began to interpret that state of geo-political uncertainty in a different way and began to act accordingly. What was comprehensible and legitimate for some, was incomprehensible and illegitimate for others.
By and large, all the problems that have piled up since the early 1990s resulted from our inability to bring an end to the Cold War.
But it is never late to do what is right.
Last year, the President of Belarus came up with the idea to launch a new negotiating process similar to the 1970s Helsinki process.
Certainly, it should be done with those challenges and threats in mind that are relevant for all of us today. It is worth talking about such an option that foresees expanding and reconsidering this format. What we suggest is that some of the key global ""players"" like China, Russia, the United States of America and the European Union engage collectively in a dialogue about a strategic vision for building new constructive relations.
The Republic of Belarus, for its part, stands ready to serve as a convening place. We are willing to carry out such a task with the same high degree of responsibility that marked our efforts aimed at settling the conflict in Ukraine over the past few years. Minsk stands prepared to become a bridge that would link the old with the yet unborn.

2
Agreements emanating from the dialogue would, essentially, put an end to the last epochal war. The United Nations could subsequently get much involved in their implementation.
With this, we would be able to turn the tide of the rising political fragmentation in the world.
Perhaps, some people would perceive it today as something not realistic. But this is exactly how, three years ago, was perceived the proposal by the President of the Republic of Belarus to send peacekeepers to the Ukraine. And nowadays this idea is revived and is being actively discussed in the United Nations.
The second of the two world tendencies, that is, increased globalization, has undoubtedly contributed to progress and economic development worldwide.
But, it has not been without the downsides of its own, either. What appears to matter is that the majority of the world's population did not enjoy those fruits, especially over the last few decades. As a result, we have not been able to eliminate poverty, while inequality has been steadily on the rise.
Much has been said in recent years, including from this rostrum, about the underlying economic causes. If simply put, the global economy has not been guided by a ""win-win"" approach. Instead, it operated in the interests of corporate capital, not of ordinary people.
Consequently, the economic globalization has not become a wave that would lift all boats.
Yet, there are certain grounds for optimism.
We base it on two factors  regional integration and new creative ideas in the global economy.
Regional integration is a key feature of the contemporary world. In places where it is successful, it leaves less room for political fragmentation.
Belarus has been deeply involved in a number of integration processes in its region. For instance, this year we preside over the Central European Initiative.
Belarus has been vigorously advocating the ideas of cooperation and interconnectivity among regional processes for the last couple of years. We call such an approach ""integration of integrations"".
It stems from the assumption that, in terms of structural functionality, the current world is composed not just of countries, but also of regions. We are thus convinced of the need for regional integration processes to engage with each other in broad cooperation, in a manner similar to the patterns of cooperation that exist among states.
When it comes to new creative ideas, we certainly point to the initiative called ""One Belt, One Road"" promoted by the People's Republic of China.
This initiative stands as a new type of economic multilateralism. It is seeking to bring benefits not only to its individual participants, but to the global economy as a whole. It is a true ""win-win"" approach.
The Republic of Belarus both participates in and supports the initiative.
In our view, the ""integration of integrations' and the ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative can help us shift the global economy from the path of divergence to one of convergence. Globalization must become more equitable.

3
How can the United Nations help in addressing the challenges posed by political fragmentation and uneven economic globalization?
One of the primary tasks for the United Nations in the century past was to keep great powers from waging major internecine wars. The UN proved to be good at that test. It furnished a convening space wherein the opposite parties could work with something positive in their minds. As a result, World War III was avoided.
Nowadays, the realities are different, which require us to reconsider both the role and the place of the Organization in the world. What is specifically at stake is how the UN fits into a world that is being increasingly dominated by various closed clubs and informal entities.
We are convinced that, as ever before, the United Nations must aim to strengthen the inter-state system. It is at the UN where its Members should successfully resolve their differences and forge acceptable solutions. Moreover, it is at the United Nations, where they can successfully tackle trasboundary threats.
What is more, the UN should serve as a uniting force for the system of international relations as a whole. In other words, the entire complex set of new dimensions in these relations, like closed clubs, informal entities, alliances and others, should be anchored to the United Nations. If done so, the system will operate in a coherent, concerted and effective manner.
The new Secretary General has launched a comprehensive process of UN reform. We generally welcome this undertaking. We would like to particularly highlight the relevance and importance of the Secretary-Generals' initiatives related to the maintenance of international peace and security and to combatting terrorism.
We understand that success in the UN's transformation will determine to a large extent the role and place of the United Nations in the world for many years to come.
At the same time we are convinced that such success will be possible if all of us hold fast to the following three principled guidances.
First, the reform must be transparent, logical and result-oriented.
Second, the reform should lead neither to more red tape nor to higher burden on Member States.
Third, the reform needs to be inclusive, that is, each and every Member State's voice must he heard.
But the key reform of the UN system is not about revising its patterns of interaction or streamlining its individual elements. Reform is not about the optimization of human resources and funding either.
The most serious, that is, the far-reaching reform should occur in our attitudes towards the Organization. Today, the UN General Assembly constitutes a unique deliberative forum. This forum is essential to grasping both the fragility and the diversity of our world.
We, Member States need to regain the sense of owning our Organization, which somewhat has been lost.
Indeed, the United Nations is not only about its secretariat, field missions, programmes and funds. The United Nations, first and foremost, is about its Member States, about their will or lack of it, about dialogue and cooperation or alienation.

4
No ideal composition of the UN Security Council or a perfectly optimized General Assembly's agenda will matter for a world beyond the East River unless Member States demonstrate a willingness to look for ways to better understand each and come more often to agreement.
Our everyday work in the General Assembly based on our efforts to finalize multiple and lengthy resolutions constitutes neither a full-fledged dialogue nor an attempt to better understand an opponent.
Our various thematic side-events provide a platform for dozens of speakers to present their views. Yet, they rarely try to find an answer to the question of what needs to be done for us to better understand each other.
How often during our official meetings and informal consultations inconsistent arguments and unanswered questions hang in the air without reaction, or frequently simply pass on without being heard.
That is why we are deeply convinced that the key UN reform will happen only when together we decide to create the conditions  both organizational and in terms of our goal-setting  necessary to utilize the United Nations as a practical tool in search for ways to resolve contradictions and disputes among Member States without violence or war.
We want to bring home this message to both the Secretary General and the UN Member States.
Mr. President,
History shows that a world order or a system of international relations has always been born in insufferable pain, resulting from either major wars or other epochal events.
Do we need just another major war or another global calamity for the current ""rudderless"" world to acquire the outlines of an order?
I am convinced that no one wants to contemplate such a scenario.
Belarus has proposed ways to address the major global challenges.
We fully realize how daring and unrealistic the idea of forging a renewed architecture for Eurasian-Atlantic cooperation and security may appear to many people at this stage.
Likewise, we can admit that our initial ideas about the outlines and, perhaps, a substantive content of this process may be far from perfect.
Furthermore, not everyone is ready to embrace Belarus' idea about the importance of tighter cooperation among regional integration processes.
What, however, we are firmly convinced of is that it is high time for all of us to demonstrate urgency in action and cooperation for the sake of peace and prosperity
I would like to conclude with a very fitting quotation. Martin Luther King said: ""Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words: too late"".
It is still within our power to act lest it becomes too late.
Thank you for your kind attention."
Belize,"Before I deliver my statement, I wish to extend heartfelt condolences to our sister countries in the Caribbean on the destruction and loss of life suffered in consequence of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. etands united with the Caribbean Community to render our full support.
I also extend solidarity to our northern neighbor Mexico as you begin to recover from the recent earthquakes.
Mr. President,
As you observed in your opening statement, you have assumed the Presidency of the General Assembly in a most challenging time for multilateralism. My government and people have every confidence in your leadership and you can be assured of our full and active support to fulfill the agenda of the seventy-second
session.
Focusing on people - striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet: the Belizean experience
Belize celebrated on 21 September, her thirty-sixth year of independence. Over the thirty-six years, we have matured into a unified nation, embracing all peoples in the fabric of our society, and enjoying a peaceful existence. We have worked assiduously to uplift every Belizean especially those who have been victims of anachronistic prejudices and we have done so with an eye to ensure that successive generations can benefit from the fruits of our labor and our natural resources. Our development has been modest in relative terms, but progressive and steady.

Readily we have embraced the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and launched our Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy which integrates the global sustainable development goals (SDGs). Our nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement further complement the GSDS. Already we are seeing the dividends of that early investment in policy and action. Belize has met several goals on road safety, marine protection, and sustainable fisheries.
These early accomplishments are mere benchmarks. We know that for our sustainable development, we must go above and beyond and so my government is setting even more ambitious targets. At the Oceans Conference, we announced our commitment to further strengthen the legislative and regulatory framework on fisheries; to increase marine reserves from 3 percent to 10 percent of our territorial waters; and to implement legislation to curb the use of plastics/microplastics. Amongst our ambitious climate action contributions, Belize is committed to zero emissions growth in its forestry sector and aims to achieve 85 percent renewables in electricity production by 2027.
In addition to national action, we are also undertaking regional action, leveraging the strength of the Caribbean Community to optimize results for all our peoples by uniting our efforts to fight disease and security threats. Belize proudly hosted the launch of the CARICOM First Ladies and Spouses of Prime Ministers Network in support of the implementation of SDG 5 and the Every Caribbean Woman Every Caribbean Child initiative. Our leaders are also renewing and deepening efforts to tackle non communicable diseases through targeted approaches to promote healthy lifestyles starting from the youngest members of our communities. For our region, security and climate change are equally fundamental threats to our survival. The region has risen to these challenges, adopting its own Counter-
2

terrorism Strategy and pioneering innovative approaches to build resilience and facilitate its transition to low and no carbon economies across the region.
Financing a people centred development: challenges and opportunities
The cost of implementation is by no means negligible. At the national level, conservative estimates approximate the costs for implementation of the Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy at a quarter of Belize's GDP.
Belize's development finance strategy mirrors the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action. We are tapping into a mix of domestic and international resources from various channels mindful of the inhospitable international policy environment. Domestically, my government is strengthening capacity to improve revenue collection.
Incentivizing business investment in Belize is also a critical action point for my government. Like other vulnerable small island developing states, Belize saw a sharp decline in foreign direct investment over the period 2015-2016. As of 2016, FDI flows to SIDS represented only 0.2 percent of overall global flows. To buck that downward trend, we have reformed incentives for doing business in Belize within the policy space prescribed by our World Trade Organization obligations. We have also reformed key institutions to ensure the integrity of our financial services industry. Government has strengthened the institutional capacity, legislative framework and supervisory mandate of its Financial Intelligence Unit. The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) determined that Belize is compliant with international standards.
3

J
I
The OECD Global Forum, which presently sets the international standards on tax cooperation, has listed Belize as a ""largely compliant"" tax jurisdiction, having successfully completed the Global Forum Peer Review Process on legislative measures and regulatory and administrative measures.
In 2013, Belize accepted the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, the purpose of which is to facilitate cooperation between jurisdictions with a view to combating tax avoidance and evasion internationally. Additionally, Belize has committed to the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) and has entered into 31 bilateral Exchange of Information Agreements.
Nevertheless, Belize's reputation, financial industry and economy remain vulnerable to unilateral declarations labeling our jurisdiction as uncooperative or non compliant. Such unilateral declarations cause undue damage to Belize's reputation, to the integrity of its financial services industry and dissuade investors. They undermine the significant legislative and administrative measures undertaken by our Government to ensure Belize's compliance with international standards and its legal obligations. Even worse, they undermine the very legitimacy of institutions that promulgate the global standards by which we are supposed to all be measured.
For Belize, the United Nations must institute the necessary checks and balances to the international financial architecture. We see a role for the UN as a central multilateral forum to consolidate efforts and promote coherence and international cooperation on issues that will support domestic resource mobilization. Because of its universal nature, the UN is best poised to foster a more inclusive transparent and consultative process to address issues as
4

international cooperation on tax matters and the broader question of financing for sustainable development.
Notwithstanding our best efforts, meeting the costs of implementation will not be possible from our domestic resources alone. We rely on our bilateral partners from the North and South. We have also developed strong working relationships with multilateral development banks. But with our current status as a middle income country, our access to grant and concessional financing is severely constrained. Belize is in the unenviable position of being a heavily indebted middle income country. External public debt stands at 70% of GDP ($2.3m) and domestic debt at 22% of GDP (S750m); interest costs alone for these debt obligations is S109m during the current fiscal year. Left without viable alternatives, Government remains reliant on loan financing for development at market rates.
My government has endeavored to bring a case to our private debtors to re negotiate an onerous bond that threatens to upend our debt sustainability. The world of international private finance however is not a world that places high priority on public policy especially the public policy of a foreign government. The Caribbean is experiencing this reality with the ongoing crises of the withdrawal of correspondent banking services to our indigenous financial institutions. It matters not to the likes of Bank of America, or JP Morgan Chase that ending correspondent banking relations with a national bank or a central bank effectively excludes that country from the global financial system. And the response from the country where those banks are located is mere sympathy. This is a major concern not for the Caribbean alone, but for all developing countries given the universal pivot to the private sector to finance the development agenda.
5

It behooves the United Nations to develop a participatory framework for the private sector to account for their commitments and action to advance the global goals. The High-level Political Forum offers a useful platform to integrate such a framework. The United Nations should also develop appropriate capacity to track the alignment of private financial flows with the 2030 Agenda.
It is also incumbent upon the United Nations to accelerate progress in re-defining development metrics that take into account the anomaly of heavily indebted middle income countries particularly those with unique challenges as small island developing states (SIDS).
Belize welcomes the Secretary-General's commitment to SIDS. Let me take this opportunity to commend him and you, Mr. President, for holding a special session on Hurricane Irma. I wish to extend my own government's pledge of solidarity to our Caribbean family that was devastated by that unprecedented storm and more recently Hurricane Maria. Irma and Maria exposes at once the acute humanitarian challenge and the equally acute development challenge that SIDS face. That challenge is, without question, a global challenge as the Secretary General has rightly stated. We look forward to engaging in action oriented discussions to facilitate the piloting of finance for sustainable development initiatives across SIDS such as debt swaps for climate action, and the expansion of climate risk insurance to support adaptation measures at the individual through to the national levels. The UN can serve as a global incubator for genuine and durable multi-stakeholder partnerships that can foster innovation and entrepreneurship in SIDS.

At the country level, we are ready to engage in discussions on how to ensure that the United Nations on the ground is fit for our country purposes as we aim to implement the ambitious 2030 Agenda and develop country specific solutions for sustainable financing.
Belize fully agrees with the Secretary General that the UN has a crucial role to play as a catalyst, an innovator, convenor and a champion of what works. Since its inception the United Nations has been orchestrating a rules based framework for countries to cooperate and take collective action. As we embrace this new era of openness, transparency and accountability, the way in which the UN itself operates must likewise reflect openness transparency and accountability of all. who engage and benefit from international cooperation.
We depend on the UN to champion and protect the rule of law, to ensure the universality of core agreements, and to develop new treaties to address gaps where they exist. It is in this vein that Belize looks to the United Nations as the firewall between democracy and tyranny, between social justice and oppression, between the global good and self-interest. Its ultimate role is to protect the interest of humanity as a whole. And it is in this spirit that we expect the UN to act. We are therefore insistent that overdue reforms of the UN's peace and security architecture especially the Security Council be completed forthwith so that there can be no obstacle to action.
Belize has long supported the United Nations in its role - we have supported its endeavors to forge new partnerships for development, to advance global health policies, to bring justice to victims of crimes against humanity, to protect the most vulnerable, and to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction including
7

small arms and light weapons. And we have been at the forefront of the global fight to protect and preserve our shared natural environment against environmental degradation and climate change and to ensure sustainable use especially of our ocean which sustains life on earth. Through the Caribbean Community, we are also leading the charge for reparation of the victims of slavery and their descendants.
For Belize, as a Member State of the United Nations, advocating for peaceful cooperation amongst states, for the right of self determination of all peoples and for the promotion and protection of human rights, is a non-derogable duty. We cannot therefore in good faith remain silent wherever injustice persists.
We see that injustice perpetrated upon the people of Taiwan who uphold the core principles and objectives of the UN and yet the UN itself fails to apply those principles and objectives to them.
For over half a century, the Cuban people have been the victims of the injustice of an egregious and illegal unilateral embargo. We see injustice continuing to shadow the people of Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara, South Sudan, and North Korea.
The situation in Venezuela is one which continues to challenge all of us in our region and the hemisphere. Belize fully subscribes to the CARICOM position; which underscores the respect for international law and principles and also urges resolution through dialogue. In that regard CARICOM has offered its own good offices.
8

In our region, we are witness to the continuing suffering of our Haitian brothers and sisters. In the face of such intolerable injustice, Belize cannot remain silent nor should the rest of the world. We support UN efforts to bring justice to all who have been alienated, oppressed, victimized, and silenced. If we fail to uphold our duty to the norms and values of the UN, humankind itself suffers. But when we defend those norms and values, there is no greater redemption. The Haitian people know this all too well and with good reason they look now with eyes aloft to the new approach of the UN to cholera in Haiti and the establishment of the UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti.
Likewise, when Belize's territorial integrity was at stake, Belize turned to the UN to defend its sovereignty over its land and for as long as we have been a dutiful Member State, we have had peace. We want that peace to endure and so we have taken every measure to bring Guatemala to the table of justice in respect of its unfounded claim on our territory.
Belize and Guatemala agreed in 2008, subject to the will of both our peoples, to refer the Guatemalan claim to Belize territory to the International Court of Justice, the judicial organ of this organization. Both Belize and Guatemala are poised to conduct the requisite referenda to obtain the consent of our peoples. In the meantime, we continue, and with the full support of the Organization of American States, to take a constructive approach to the bilateral relations and to maintaining peace along the borders. Belize remains committed to working with Guatemala to finalise a cooperation mechanism for the Sarstoon River in order to minimise the potential of tensions or incidents along Belize's southern border.

Conclusion For thirty six years, Belizeans have lived in harmony with one another and with nature. By the sweat of their brows, they have built a strong nation together with their leaders and with the support of other friendly nations. They have honored a constitution that entrenches social, economic and environmental justice for all. We will persevere in the struggle to achieve these just objectives and look to the United Nations for its continued support. The United Nations, and every Member State, in turn can be assured that Belize will defend this community of nations and its principles and objectives. Our national motto is sub umbrafloreo - under the shade we flourish. Under the shade of the United Nations, we shall all flourish.

Bhutan,"Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates.
1 bring warm greetings of His Majesty the Druk Gyalpo.
Climate Change
Distinguished Delegates.
Today my thoughts are with the people of Mexico, who have suffered two terrible earthquakes this month.
My thoughts are also with the victims of other natural disasters that have recently brought pain and misery to people around the world: the three recent hurricanes that battered communities in the Caribbean and in the United States, and the devastating floods in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka that have taken more than 1200 lives.
Please join me in observing a moment of silence, to reflect on the suffering of these communities and to offer our prayers for their recovery.
Thank you.
These disasters are not isolated incidents. Experts are increasingly convinced that natural disasters like hurricanes and floods are made worse by climate change.
Climate change is a reality. Each of the last three years has been the hottest in recorded history. 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have all occurred in this new century. And this must alarm us, for we are only in 2017.
There is no room for complacency, hesitation or finger pointing, excuses or procrastination. The urgency is now. Our wellbeing is at stake. The survival of future generations is at risk.
The Paris Agreement is proof that we have accepted that climate change is a reality, and that we are willing to come together, to work together, to fight climate change together. I urge all countries to fulfill the promises they made in Paris.

As a landlocked mountainous country, we are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. And that's why we are particularly alarmed at unchecked environmental degradation, the root cause of climate change. We already experience flash floods, glacial lake outbursts, and severe and erratic weather patterns, the effects of which can be particularly devastating for a poor country.
But we will not give up. We will take action.
We have ratified the Paris Agreement and we are well on our way to fulfilling our pledges.
72% of our country is under forest cover, and more than half our country is protected as national parks, wild life sanctuaries and nature reserves. What this means is that we are the world's only carbon neutral country. In fact, we are a carbon negative country. In addition, we generate and export clean renewable electricity, and invest in green industries and organic farming practices.
After centuries of neglect, fighting climate change is complex and it is expensive. That is why it is critical that all countries fulfill their respective commitments. But that takes money. And hence the importance of climate financing mechanisms.
However, securing financing is one of the biggest challenges for smaller nations. So the role of climate financing institutions is essential.
We applaud the Global Environmental Facility, for financing more than 4000 environmental projects in 170 countries since its establishment in the 1990s.
The Green Climate Fund has also begun helping developing countries around the world respond to climate change through innovative and transformative interventions.
These institutions are critical for those who have the will but may not have the resources to take action. I applaud the innovative strategies and interventions that they have supported.
On our part, we have launched Bhutan for Life in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund. Bhutan for Life is an innovative financing mechanism, which will help safeguard our rich biodiversity until our government can assume the full cost of their protection.
Now is the time to scale up our support to GEF and GCF. This will enable all countries to fight climate change on a war footing, and help developing countries respond to its effects.
1 am optimistic that we will be able to prevent the worst effects of climate change. But for that we must work together. While the threat of natural disasters will always remain, we can ensure that they are not directly linked to human-induced activity.

Poverty
Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates,
The World Bank estimates that more than 800 million people live in poverty. For them, hunger, malnourishment and deprivation are everyday realities. And that reality - the scourge of poverty - silently kills countless millions every year.
I ask that you please join me in observing a moment of silence for the millions of people around the world, particularly children, who are suffering or dying from poverty and malnourishment.
Poverty has no place in this day and age. After all this era - our era - is blessed with unprecedented wealth, knowledge and technology, giving rise to levels of prosperity the world has never seen before. Yet millions are condemned to a life of poverty.
The SDGs are critical in this regard. They give us reason for hope. While every one of the 17 Goals will contribute to eradicating the scourge of poverty, our common resolve is articulated powerfully in the very first goal of the SDGs, which promises nothing less than to ""end poverty in all its forms everywhere.""
Eradication of poverty, like climate change, is also complex and expensive. But according to one estimate, it would take only US$175 billion per year to end extreme poverty. That should come as good news, as that is barely 0.32% of the current global GDP.
No doubt, we have a lot of work to do, but the SDGs provide a realistic roadmap for this important task. However there are no shortcuts.
In this connection, the Secretary General's reform initiatives will ensure that the UN is fit for purpose and that it is able to respond to the call for transformation, to bring about shared prosperity for all peoples of the world.
I thank Secretary General Guterres for initiating these bold measures and call on all Member States to render full support to the important reforms.
We in Bhutan are blessed. Our enlightened monarchs have carefully balanced economic growth with social development, environmental sustainability and cultural preservation, all within the framework of good governance.
We call this holistic approach to development ""Gross National Happiness,"" or GNH. This unique philosophy guarantees all our citizens free education and free healthcare, while providing additional targeted interventions for the poor.

I am happy to report that our efforts are bearing fruit. Multidimensional poverty has already fallen by half and we are well on our way to reduce it still further, to 5%, within the next few years. Our success in reducing poverty is a tribute to the leadership of our Kings and the spirit of the people of Bhutan.
It is also due to the support of the UN and our other development partners, particularly India, Japan, the EU, ADB and the World Bank. Their continued support, partnership and generosity has helped us reduce poverty, achieve social growth, and prepare us for imminent graduation from the LDC category.
Terrorism
Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates
I now ask you to join me in observing a moment of silence to remember the victims of global terrorism.
Recent acts of terrorism have brought pain and suffering to countless people in nearly every part of the world, and far too many lives have been cruelly lost. The horrific acts committed by terrorist groups undermine global peace and security, and Bhutan joins the call for united action to combat these extremists.
To win the fight against terrorism we have no option but to strengthen the United Nations, so that multilateralism and global cooperation are further enhanced.
Two years ago I joined many others in calling for UN reform. The Secretary General's reform initiatives will provide the much-needed framework to revitalize and strengthen the UN. Bhutan joins all member states in backing this bold endeavor.
But any UN reform would be incomplete without reforming the Security Council to reflect the changing realities of our world. As such, countries like India and Japan, Brazil and Germany must be called upon to serve as permanent members in the Security Council. And Africa must be appropriately represented.
We recognize that global peace and security is a shared concern and responsibility. As a peaceful country, one that has enjoyed the benefits of UN membership for over four decades, it is now time for us to contribute to global peace and security, even if only modestly.
Therefore, it was with a sense of pride and duty, that Bhutan joined the peacekeeping movement in 2014. Since then, we have gradually deepened our peacekeeping engagement in keeping with our duty to contribute, albeit in a small way, to the cause of global peace and security.

In doing so, our peacekeepers have, and always will, uphold the highest standards of integrity, ethics and professionalism while discharging their important responsibilities.
Today, our military and police officers serve in 11 peacekeeping missions. And the first ever military contingent from Bhutan is now ready for deployment to a peacekeeping mission.
However, the bedrock of global peace and security ultimately rests within each of our individual countries. And for that, every country must protect the rights of its citizens, strengthen participatory government, and enable economic opportunity for all. These are the very principles of democracy and freedom, which must be nurtured and strengthened.
Nine years ago, Bhutan embarked on the path of democracy. In an unprecedented move in human history, our King, at the height of his popularity, imposed democracy against the will of his people.
After a century of peace and prosperity under our enlightened monarchs, there was much apprehension and fear. But nine years on, it gives me great satisfaction to report that the state of democracy in Bhutan is well entrenched and irreversible.
Today, all the institutions of democratic governance have been established and are functioning well, along with a growing body of civil society, and a strong and vibrant media. We held successful elections in 2008 and 2013, and look forward to a third election next year, in 2018.
Mr. President
The importance of the United Nations has never been greater and the imperative for multilateralism has never been stronger. As we look to the future, Bhutan will continue working with all member states, to ensure that the United Nations continues to play an instrumental role in fighting climate change, eradicating poverty and maintaining global peace and security.
In this connection, I have the honour to conclude with a quote from our beloved King, His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck:
""No nation today can stand alone in achievemenL Time is slowly telling us, that there can be no lasting individual success, without success as a community, and there cannot be lasting national progress and success, flit does not fit into a future of global peace, harmony and equality. The world must progress together, or fail together.""
Thank you and Tashi Delek!"
Bosnia_and_Herzegovina,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellences, Distinguished delegates.
Distinguished President of the General Assembly, Mr. Lajcak, Please allow me, first of all, to congratulate you on the mandate you have just started as the President of the 72nd Session. I am convinced that your tact and diplomacy, which we in Bosnia and Herzegovina have witnessed first hand, will help the most important body of the United Nations make new progress and effectively face new challenges. My gratitude also goes to the outgoing President, for the leadership he showed during the previous (71st) Session. I would like to join others in congratulating H.E. Antdnio Guterres on his election for the Secretary-General of the United Nations. His noble and wise intention to dedicate more attention to building bridges that connect us all in the years ahead will surely have the greatest possible support in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In a world dominated by uncertainty and insecurity, it is simply not possible to overstate the importance of the principles and the multilateral framework defined for us by the founders of the United Nations. The strength of this Organization is in both individual and our common strength in the effort to eradicate diseases, hunger, terrorism and any kind of threat to human existence. In doing so, of course, we must admit to ourselves how necessary and important it is to use thoughtful and constructive measures to bring the UN system closer to its chaotic surroundings and adapt it in a way that anticipates the challenges coming from such environment and respond to them with force the strength of which goes far beyond a simple
sum of our individual strengths.
We still witness, with unquestioning concern, the continued suffering of the Syrian people. Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly condemns every form of violence against the civilian population. Violence must stop. Each Syrian child, woman and man, and each Syrian refugee, must have its dignity of a human being restored, as well as the belief in the possibility of recovery and new life opportunities. We, as well as the others who are here today, will continue to call for a peaceful and political solution through negotiations, in the process the ownership of which can only be in the hands of the Syrian people, based on the Geneva

Communique and with the assistance of the international community and the United Nations, led by the Special Envoy for Syria, whose unselfish efforts to continue the negotiations in Geneva are highly appreciated.
Mr. President,
It seems truly unnecessary to repeat that there can be no peace and prosperity for the Israeli people if the same is not provided for the Palestinians, and vice versa. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents the most serious unresolved problem in the Middle East, and current absence of any negotiations between the parties is disturbing. Both nations deserve better. Again, and this has been happening for decades, the journey towards peace has been too slow and has become more and more complex. Therefore, it is necessary to firmly recall the ultimate goal, and that is the existence of the two states, Israel and Palestine, and their peaceful coexistence next to each other, in safety and within recognized borders. Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to believe that this goal can be achieved by both parties fulfilling their obligations, based on the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, the Madrid Principles and the Arab Peace Initiative.
Evil has always existed, throughout human history, sometimes on the margins of our communities, sometimes to a greater or lesser extent within them, not always in the same form and the same intensity. Terrorism, undoubtedly, is the greatest evil of today, in its form and strength that represents the greatest threat to intemational peace and security. Destmctive forces are always deep-rooted and feature many different faces, but there is no justification for their existence. We need joint and concentrated efforts, along with a multidimensional and integrated approach, to overcome terrorism and permanently eliminate the fear of terror from our communities. Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to contribute to the full implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We particularly welcome the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral Antdnio Guterres in strengthening the United Nations counter-terrorist capacities and, in that regard, the establishment of the new Office of Counter-Terrorism. As far as we are concerned, we are ready to continuously strengthen co-operation at regional, sub-regional and intemational level, especially in the areas of information collection and exchange. As a member of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL/Da'esh, we will continue to support the Coalition efforts to liberate entire human communities and help them recover from the

suffering and harm imposed by ISIL/Da'esh and its global network. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to the full implementation of all Security Council resolutions aimed at bringing persons involved in financing, planning, preparing or executing terrorist acts to justice.
Furthermore, we fully share the view that for the long-term eradication of the evil of terrorism and violent extremism, it is necessary to continuously invest efforts in the entire spectrum of interconnected areas, from the eradication of injustice and inequality, poverty and lack of freedom to improving the understanding among those who differ and very and strengthening intercultural dialogue and generally accepted democratic values.
Once we start thinking that we have done enough in all areas, we need to start again and
double our efforts!
The world without threat of total destruction of Mankind is less Utopia if the means and arms for destruction are fewer. Therefore, disarmament and non-proliferation of weapon of mass destruction (WMD) are still the perquisite for the global peace and security towards which we all strive. In that context, Bosnia and Herzegovina joins the strong condemnation of the nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). We also call
upon the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to comply without delay, fully and unconditionally, with its obligations under all relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions.
Mr. President,
My faith in the value of the Agenda 2030 is as strong today as it was two years ago, when we adopted it at this very place. In Bosnia and Herzegovina it receiveddue institutional attention, based on its signiRcance and the nobility of the goals it sets before us. The roles have been defined, the goals are clear, the coordination established, and in the following period we have a reason to expect significant and more measurable developments in terms of its implementation and supervision. However, we are aware that this will not be easy. For the consistent implementation of the goals set by the Agenda, we will have to overcome numerous weaknesses. For us, as well as for other developing countries burdened by the disproportion of wishes and possibilities, a strong political will and even decisive practical steps in the right direction will not always be enough. Fulfilling the noble and ambitious

goals requires knowledge and norms that many of the UN member states do not have, and it might produce an additional burden to the already overburdened state budgets. Therefore, the assistance in formulating strategies and policies, the transfer of technologies, the provision of financial resources, and assistance in measuring progress are indisputably crucial, along with, of course, the countries' full ownership over the implementation processes. In this regard, it should be emphasized that in all the activities related to the implementation of the Agenda 2030 we work extremely well with the UN bodies and agencies active in our country and we want this cooperation to be even more fruitful.
We have fully understood and accepted the strong interconnectedness of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. We ratified the Paris Climate Agreement and chose to follow its guidelines. It is a debt to our children and to the Planet that has to be unconditionally fulfilled.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, through its membership in the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), encourages mutual exchange of experiences in various aspects of the Agenda implementation. We expect the countries that have been a bit faster and more successful on this ambitious path to unselfishly share the best experiences and give recommendations, while the countries facing difficulties need to be willing and ready to accept new and different ways of resolving them.
Whether I look back to our past or look into the present and the future, women in my country hold high positions, which rightfully and naturally belong to them. The role of women is vital for the development and prosperity of the family, as well as the society as a whole. In post conflict environments, women are always the first to extend the hand of reconciliation. In times of great challenges and risks, we need the strength and natural ability of women to pursue peaceful solutions more than ever. Although we are extremely proud of the significant progress we have made in implementing the provisions of the historic Security Council resolution 1325 (Women, Peace and Security), we are also aware of the areas where it is possible and needed to do considerably more. We will certainly continue to invest additional efforts to strengthen and empower Bosnian-Herzegovinian women and girls in accordance with thfe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.

There is another social group that deserves special attention. Young people are a constant source of change and an incubator of inventive solutions to our problems of the past. Healthy, educated, and employed, they represent the engine that drives our societies forward. Environments where young people have limited access to education, economic development and decision-making processes are subject to frustration, social unrest and instability. For this reason, a significant part of the reform processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina is dedicated to creating conditions for reducing the youth unemployment, which corresponds to Goals 8.5 and 8.6 of the Agenda 2030.
Mr. President,
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, unfortunately, we know too much about the high price of wars. For us, preventive diplomacy is a tool that, when used at the right time, can help that wars are never repeated anywhere or to anyone. There are many reasons why, on a global level, the United Nations system must be at the heart of all activities using preventive measures to resolve the crises and prevent people from leaving their homes. Again, much of the responsibility for prevention lies with other levels. Within our communities, we must counter all the symptoms of trouble and conflicts. We must correct social injustice, reconcile what seems irreconcilable, persevere in compromise, strive for pluralistic and inclusive solutions, appreciate equally own and the rights of others, and constantly and continuously seek ways to find a conunon language. I believe that prevention and mediation, as well as conflict management techniques and conflict resolution in divided societies should be applied first within the respective region, with regional actors who generally better understand the opposing sides, their reasoning and their different views of the problem.
We are proud of our participation in the United Nations peacekeeping missions in Southern Sudan, Cyprus, Afghanistan, Congo and Mali, which we consider to be the most direct contribution to building world peace. We also see our involvement in the United Nations missions as a way to do things that are possible today, but not so long ago were almost impossible to even imagine, to help people in areas affected by conflicts. We appreciate the decisive role of women in all processes of recovery and rebuilding of societies destroyed by the wars, and we will especially promote and encourage the increase in their engagement.

Mr. President,
Bosnia and Herzegovina has learned lessons from its difficult past, and has chosen to follow in its future the principle set by the founders of the European Union sixty years ago. We have adopted the European path, and, choosing between cooperation and confrontation, we chose and will always choose cooperation and search for common compromises. On our own, but also with the unselfish help of our European friends, we do everything we can to find as many opportunities for open dialogue as possible and we use each of these opportunities to build even more trust and mutually beneficial connections for our people who, despite the difficulties and the complicated times, have more common links and interests than we, their leaders, are sometimes willing to recognize. Reconciliation, trust, partnership and cooperation of all of us, in both narrow and wide context, must become living and long-term principles for stable and secure future. Therefore, commitment to regional initiatives and constructive action through the regional organizations we belong to are high on the list of our foreign policy priorities.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is now doing everything to speed up its progress to where it really belongs, within the framework of the strong European family whose values it shares. Reform and other processes that we are pursuing for this purpose are not always simple or easy, but we see them as a unique opportunity to accelerate the harmonization of our economic, social and institutional development with what awaits us tomorrow in the European Union. Therefore, we will continue fulfilling the obligations undertaken in order to reach the status of a candidate by the beginning of next year with true commitment, which will be a powerful and much needed boost to internal consolidation and further acceleration of integration
processes.
However, it is with concern that I would like to draw your attention to the fact that my country is going through a period of important challenges. I am deeply convinced that one people in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be happy and prosperous if the other two are not; if all other people living in our country are not. In this regard, I believe that it is up to us in Bosnia and Herzegovina to make a crucial step to adopt changes to electoral legislation by the end of this year, in accordance with the Decisions of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in the past, we expect understanding and support of international

community in solving this issue of vital importance for further democratization and achieving our full integration into the European Union.
Please allow me, Mr. President,
to conclude with a reminder that all of our needs - economic, social, security, political, and cultural - can be very diverse, as are our possibilities to achieve them. The choices we make
every day to ensure prosperity for our people also vary from one Member State to another. I am convinced that the future of the human race will largely depend on our current ability to turn our differences into advantages. We expect the United Nations system to guide us in this and to assist us, above all, in building a system based on the unity of diversity. The precondition for that is to resist all the challenges and tendencies aiming to disintegrate or assimilate us. A strong UN system, adapted to the complex circumstances of our surroundings, could be of great assistance to us. Therefore, I am firmly convinced that Bosnia and Herzegovina will remain committed to the principles that we all share, promoting the protection of human dignity, equal rights, both individual and collective, as well as respecting the needs of others and those different from us. That is the best way for us to contribute to preserving and building peace and well-being within our global community.
Thank you."
Botswana,"Mr. President Excellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,
I feel deeply honoured and privileged to deliver this Statement on behalf of the President of the Republic of Botswana, His Excellency Lt. General Dr. Seretse Khama Ian Khama.
On behalf of my delegation, I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating you on your election as President of the Seventy-Second Session of the UN General Assembly.
I assure you of the full support and cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of your mandate.
In the same vein, please allow me to pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency IVlr. Peter Thomson, for his stewardship of the Seventy-First Session.
lay I also seize this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to our new Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antoni6 Guterres and to wish him an enjoyable and successful tenure at the helm of our world body.
We also thank our erstwhile Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his leadership and the valuable contribution his has made towards advancing the mandate of our organization over the past decade.
Mr. Presidentv
We are gathered here at the United Nations because we share a common destiny. Despite its imperfections, the United Nations remains the only universal organization that has the moral authority and legitimacy to seek global solutions to the challenges we face.

..............

L

8, Botswana is of the firm conviction that as Member States, we collectively hold the will and the power to change the world for the better, and for the benefit of both present and future generations.
Sustainable Development
Mr, President,
9, Botswana welcomes the theme of this Session namely, ""Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for Aft on a Sustainable Planet.""
o: We strongly feel that this theme is pertinent because it reinforces the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which the global community adopted on 25th September 2015 as ""a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity"" or ""a charter for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership in the twenty-first century.""
. This theme appropriately draws our attention to the 4 of the 5 Ps of the 2030 Agenda, namely People, Planet, Prosperity and Peace. It recognises the importance of focusing on people and improving their lives, as the main beneficiaries of development and the greatest resource, in order to realize peace and development on a sustainable and resilient pathway. By so doing, it recognises the nexus between peace and security, sustainable development and climate change.
2. In this regard, the 2030 Agenda notes that ""There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development."" It is therefore imperative that we prioritise the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in order to achieve sustainable development and address climate change.

13. Regarding People, I am pleased to state that the Government of Botswana embarked on a series of multi-stakeholder consultations involving both the public and private sector, civil society; local authorities, development partners and the academia in the formulation of our National Development Plan 11 (2017-2023) and Vision 2036 (2017-2036), which are aligned to the 2030 Agenda and the African Union Agenda 2063.
I4. We purposefully undertook extensive consultations to ensure that our national priorities reflect our people's needs and aspirations.
15. We hold the view that our people have a right to sustainable development and improved quality of life. We therefore must pursue these twin objectives as a moral and political imperative.
I6. It is important to recall that when we adopted Agenda 2030 some two years ago, we acknowledged that every Goal, every Target and every Indicator in that Agenda represents a step towards a better world.
17. We recognised the need for each country, based on its needs and circumstances, to formulate a unique set of actions to achieve the Universal Goals we set for ourselves.
18. We also recognised that Innovation, Science and Technology will be critical catalysts in the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

I9. In line with the theme, our two national development frameworks place heavy emphasis on improving the quality of life of all people in Botswana through acceleration of socioeconomic development and provision of better education, healthcare, housing and tackling extreme poverty, income inequality, gender inequality and unemployment, especially among the youth and women.
zo. Driven by our strong desire to build an inclusive, peaceful and prosperous society based on the respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, we accordingly adjusted our empwerment prgrammes in o Eder t ensure that they cater for all vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in our society, including women and girls, youth, the elderly, people with disabilities, and children.
z. To this end, the top priorities of our National Development Plan 11 are human capital development, social development, developing diversified sources of economic growth, sustainable use of natural resources, consolidation of good governance and strengthening of national security, and implementation of an effective monitoring and evaluation system.
z2. In order to ensure that all our people live in dignity, the Government of Botswana took a bold policy decision to shift from poverty reduction to eradication of extreme poverty, resulting in a marked reduction of the proportion of the population living in abject poverty or below US$1.25 per day from 24.5% in 2002/2003 to 6.4% in 2009/2010. This is a notable achievement considering the fact that in 1985/1986, 59% of the population was living in poverty.
z3. We identified sustainable use of natural resources as one of the main priorities of our national development agenda to ensure that the natural wealth of our country benefits both present and future generations.

24. To address youth unemployment, the Government introduced youth empowerment programmes such as the Youth Development Fund, the National Service Programme, and the Internship Programme. For the past two decades, more than 25% of the total Government's annual budget has been invested in education and skills development.
25. In addition, we have implemented a number of flagship programmes, the centerpiece of which is the Economic Stimulus Programme (ESP), which was introduced to stimulate the economy and address the infrastructure deficit.
26. We are also proud that Botswana was among the countries which shared their 2030 Agenda implementation experience under the auspices of the recently held High Level Political Forum (HLPF) Voluntary National Review exercise.
Climate C:hanqe
Mr. President,
z. Botswana fully supports the observation made in the 2030 Agenda that ""Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our. time and its adverse impacts undermine the ability of al! countries to achieve sustainable development.""
28. In this regard, we welcome the entry into force of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and reaffirm our commitment to this Agreement.
29. Botswana is pleased to be among the countries which signed and ratified this Agreement before the achievement of the threshold of ratifications for its entry into force.
3o. We appeal to all countries to remain steadfast in their defence and protection of the integrity of the Paris Agreement.
6

s. We reiterate our appeal to the Government of the United States of America to re-consider its decision to withdraw from this landmark Agreement, which marks a universal effort by the international community to tackle challenges of climate change. As you would be aware, the challenge of climate change requires collective action, as no single country can successfully address this challenge on its own. ]:t is as if the recent Hurricanes and their disastrous effects was to underscore to the American Administration that climate change is real.
3. If there is anything positive we have learnt from these Hurricanes, it is that it has been able to bring people in the affected States and wider America together, be they young or old, black, hispanic or white or whatever religious persuasion.
ss. We also welcome the recent convening by the President of the UN General Assembly of the first ever Ocean Conference in New York, pursuant to Sustainable Development Goal 14.
s. Even though Botswana is a landlocked country, we are impacted upon one way or the other by the Ocean environment.
s. We also have a strategic interest in benefitting from marine
resources.
36. It is for this reason that we actively participated in the negotiations that led to the adoption of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which we subsequently became a State Party.

Tnternationa| Humanitarian Appeals
3z. I am delighted to announce to this august body that Botswana has responded positively to international humanitarian appeals which have been made from time to time in response to humanitarian calamities which afflicted a number of countries, including the extremely devastating famine in Somalia.
38. Consistent with our caring and compassionate nature, we will continue to do everything we can, within the limit of our meagre resources, to extend assistance to fellow members of the human family who are in dire need of humanitarian relief.
International Peace and Securit;
Mr. President,
39. According to its Charter, the UN was created ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"", and yet peace continues to elude us, especially in some parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the worldi
40. There are continuing reports of raging conflicts, gross human rights violations, extra-judicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions.
41. Thesituation in South Sudan, in particular, continues to be a cause for grave concern.
42. The country is virtually on a precipice.
43. The people of that country are yet to enjoy the peace that the August 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan was widely expected to deliver.

44. We therefore appeal to IGAD countries as the main guarantors i!/

of this Agreement, to constructively engage the leaders and i

political stakeholders in South Sudan, with a view to getting /I!

them to unconditionally commit to the full and effective iii

implementation of the Agreement.

responsible for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity can be held accountable for their actions.

North Korea
Mr. President,
49. Botswana is deeply concerned about the unrelenting and blatant contravention of international law and UN resolutions by North Korea through its continuous testing of ballistic missiles. These despicable acts by North Korea pose a threat, not only in the Korean Peninsula, but throughout the Pacific region and the world at large. It is obvious to us as it should be to everyone else that North Korea is being assisted by others to develop its missiles and nuclear technology. They are therefore, as much to blame for these missile and nuclear tests as North Korea is itself.
50. We therefore appeal to the international community to work in unison and take prompt and decisive action that will force North Korea to adhere to the values and principles of the United Nations Charter. Inaction is not an option in the face of this adversity. Regime change must be brought about in order to remove once and for all this everlasting threat to peace in that region and give the North Korea people a hope for a life of freedom and prosperity.
Western Sahara
Mr. President,
5. It is reprehensible that Western Sahara remains the only nonself governing territory on the African continent.
52. We therefore reiterate our support for the people of Western Sahara in the pursuit of their just and inalienable right to selfdetermination.

53. We strongly feel that it is high time that they are allowed to i!j
exercise this right through an independent and impartial plebiscite under the supervision of the United Nations.
54. The Saharawis have waited long enough for this to happen.
Palestine
55. We similarly support the people of Palestine in their legitimate struggle for sovereignty and independent statehood.
56. As a gesture of our support and solidarity, I am pleased to report that Botswana established diplomatic relations with the State of Palestine on the 8th March 2017.
Terrorism
Hr, President,
57, Botswana strongly condemns terrorism, violent extremism and racial intolerance in all their forms and manifestations.
58. In this regard, it is deeply regrettable that we have recently witnessed a spate of terrorist attacks on innocent people and governments around the world.
59. I am delighted to state that we stand firmly in solidarity with the governments and people of the countries concerned and also extend our deepest sympathy to them.
60. We need to be constantly mindful of the fact that no single country is immune from terrorist attacks. Theseattacks are a stark reminder of the ferocious nature of terrorism.
6. The international community must therefore urgently take concerted action to resolutely fight this scourge,

Nuclear,D, isarmament
Mr. President,
62. Botswana fully supports the international community's efforts towards nuclear disarmament.
63. We also reaffirm our commitment to international instruments that ban weapons of mass destruction such as the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and the Biological Weapons Convention.
64. In this respect, we welcome the recent adoption by the UN General Assembly of a legally binding Treaty to prohibit the production of nuclear weapons.
65. We are fully convinced that only a nuclear-free world would guarantee a safer future for our populations.
Human Riqhts Council Membership.
Mr. President,
Botswana greatly values the opportunity it was given to contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights through its membership of the Human Rights Council for two
consecutive terms.
66. With the imminent termination of our tenure in the Council in December this year, I wish to reaffirm that we will continue to work earnestly with the international community to advance the global human rights agenda and towards all the people of the world to live in democracies where human rights and the rule of law are upheld.

ez. Our advocacy on human rights is premised on the firm belief that society's aspirations for sustainable development will remain a mirage lest we re-double our collective efforts towards equality and human dignity.
Conclusion
Hr. President,
e. Permit me to conclude bY urging eyery0ne of us to maintain the momentum on the implementation of Agenda 2030. Let us summon our collective wisdom and strength, coupled with our singularity of purpose to deliver real change for the benefit of the people we represent.
. Botswana pledges to be an active and reliable partner in the common endeavour to create a better and safer world of shared prosperity, where no people, no region and no country will feel left behind.
zo. This is the best legacy we can collectively bequeath to posterity.
1: thank you for your kind attention,"
Brazil,"Mr. Miroslav Laj&k, President of the General Assembly of the United Nations,

Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State, Government, and Delegations,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. You can count on the support of the Brazilian delegation.
I am also pleased to greet the Secretary-General in our common language. Mr. SecretaryGeneral, I once again wish you enduring success during your tenure.
Mr. President,
The challenges faced by the United Nations since its creation have been manifold. And we all know that the aspirations of its founders have not been fully realized.
But the truth is that, along these more than seventy years of existence, the UN has always represented and continues to represent hope. The truth is that the UN has always represented and continues to represent the possibility of a fairer world. A world of peace and prosperity. A world in which no one should face discrimination, oppression and misery. A world in which production and consumption patterns are compatible with the well-being of the present and future generations.
The UN has established itself as a privileged arena to build this world to which we aspire. And to build this world we need method and realism, without ever losing sight of our ideals.
At this time in history, with such distinct features of uncertainty and instability, there is a clear need for more diplomacy and more negotiation - never less. We need more multilateralism and dialogue - never less. We certainly need more of the United Nations and a United Nations that is increasingly legitimate and effective.
It is for this very reason that we uphold, along with many other countries, the imperative of reforming the United Nations. It is particularly necessary to enlarge the Security Council to adapt it to the realities of the 21st century. It is urgent to listen to the will of the overwhelming majority of this Assembly.
Mr. President,
One should not assume that ideas that have proved themselves wrong in the past may now yield good results.
We reject exacerbated nationalism. We do not believe in protectionism as a solution for economic challenges - challenges that require effective responses to the root causes of social exclusion.
The pursuit of development, in all its dimensions, should guide our collective action.

Brazil's commitment to sustainable development is a deep-rooted one. It permeates our public policies and our actions abroad. During our chairmanship of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, for instance, we placed the Agenda 2030 as the axis of our activities. In all fronts, Brazil tries to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Combating climate change is a necessary part of this contribution. We stand committed to supporting the Paris Agreement. Last year, here in New York, I deposited the Brazilian instrument of ratification of the Agreement. In this area, there is no possibility to postpone action. We must act now.
My country - and I say it proudly - is leading the way towards a low-carbon economy. Clean and renewable energy sources correspond to more than 40% of the Brazilian energy matrix, three times more than the global average. We are leaders in hydroelectricity and bioenergy.
Brazil is proud to have the world's highest tropical forest cover. Deforestation is a matter of concern, especially in the Amazon. We have been drawing attention and resources to this issue. And the good news is that last year's first available data point to a reduction of more than 20% in deforestation in that region. We are back on the right track and on this track we shall remain.
Another key factor of development is trade. We are committed to an open and rules-based international trade system, with the WTO and its Dispute Settlement Mechanism at its center.
At the Ministerial Conference to be held in Buenos Aires, in December, we will face, once again, longstanding issues, that harm developing countries above all. We should make progress in market access to agricultural products and towards the elimination of agricultural subsidies that distort trade. We believe that, together, we will succeed in achieving concrete results.
All these efforts contribute to the accomplishment of our main objective: to ensure opportunities for all, everywhere.
Mr. President,
Tomorrow I will have the honor of signing the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Brazil was among the drafters of the Treaty. It will be a historical moment.
We reiterate our call for the nuclear powers to undertake additional disarmament commitments.
Brazil expresses itself with the authority of a country that, while mastering nuclear technology, willingly gave up possessing nuclear weapons. Brazil pronounces itself with the authority of a country whose own Constitution prohibits the use of nuclear technology for non-peaceful purposes. A country that was at the origin of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which, half a century ago, established the denuclearization of Latin America and the Caribbean. A country that, along with its South American and African neighbors, also turned the South

Atlantic into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Lastly, a country that - along with Argentina created a binational mechanism of nuclear safeguards that became a reference for the world.
While welcoming the achievement represented by the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, we must acknowledge that there are still issues in the agenda of peace and security that give rise to serious apprehension.
The recent nuclear and missile tests on the Korean Peninsula constitute a serious threat to which none of us can be indifferent. Brazil condemns these acts with the utmost vehemence. It is urgent to seek a peaceful resolution to a situation whose consequences are unimaginable.
In the Middle East, talks between Israel and Palestine remain at a standstill. As a friend of Palestinians and Israelis, Brazil continues to support the solution of two States living side by side in peace and security, within internationally recognized and mutually agreed borders.
In Syria, despite the de-escalation of recent months, the conflict still engenders dramatic humanitarian consequences. The solution we must pursue is essentially political - and can no longer be postponed.
Other wars cause intolerable suffering that goes beyond borders, such as in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Mali and the Central African Republic.
Let us visit the camps for refugees and displaced persons in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Kenya. Let us listen to the stories of those who have lost fathers, mothers, sons and daughters. These families have been engulfed by the irrationality of disputes that seem to know no limits. Disputes that result in violations of humanitarian law with an unacceptable frequency.
Our Secretary-General is right: we should reinvigorate the mechanisms of conflict prevention. Prevention is about diplomacy. It is about development.
It is crucial to recognize the nexus between security and development. This recognition has guided Brazil's participation in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. As MINUSTAH concludes its mandate, the international community must maintain its commitment to the Haitian people. Brazil certainly will.
In South America, Colombia is ending a more than fifty-year-long conflict. Brazil will continue to be a resolute partner in this effort.
Mr. President,
Ladies and gentlemen,
From Barcelona to Kabul, from Alexandria to Manchester, repeated demonstrations of cowardly violence do not let us forget the evil of terrorism. This evil feeds on fundamentalism and exclusion, and no country is immune to it.

Unity is crucial, particularly in view of the capacity of terrorism to adapt to new times and grounds. We will not be frightened by terror nor will we allow it to weaken our belief in freedom and tolerance.
In many of our countries, transnational crime also undermines the security and tranquility of individuals and families. Only through coordination and collaboration will we effectively combat trafficking in persons, arms and drugs, as well as money laundering.
It was in this spirit that Brazil organized last November a ministerial meeting of South American countries on border security. And it is in this spirit that we will continue cooperating with countries around the world to tackle organized crime.
Mr. President,
Regrettably, human rights violations remain frequent throughout the world - of civil and political rights, as well as of economic, social and cultural rights. We must ensure that every individual anywhere can live with dignity, according to his or her convictions and choices.
Brazil is a country of deep-rooted liberties, which has been built on a foundation of diversity. Diversity of ethnicity, culture, creed, and thought. More than anything, it is from this diversity that we draw our strength as a nation. We reject racism, xenophobia and all other forms of discrimination.
We are party to the main international human rights treaties and members of the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court. We have extended a standing invitation to UN special rapporteurs.
Today we have one of the most modern refugee laws in the world. We have just updated our immigration law, guided by the principle of humanitarian reception. We have granted humanitarian visas to Haitian and Syrian citizens. And we have welcomed thousands of migrants and refugees from Venezuela.
The human rights situation in Venezuela continues to deteriorate. We are on the side of the Venezuelan people, with whom we share a fraternal bond. In South America, there is no longer room for alternatives to democracy. This is what we have stated in Mercosur, and this is what we will continue to uphold.
Mr. President,
Brazil is going through a moment of decisive transformation.
With structural reforms, we are overcoming an unprecedented economic crisis. We are recovering our fiscal balance. And with it, the credibility of our economy. We are once again creating jobs. We are recovering the State's capacity to implement social policies indispensable to a country like ours.
We have learned and are applying this elementary rule in practice: without fiscal responsibility, social responsibility is nothing more than empty words.
The new Brazil that is emerging from these reforms is a country more open to the world.

This is the attitude of openness that we bring to the UN and that we take to Mercosur, to the G20, to BRICS, to IBSA and to all fora in which we participate. This is the openness we embrace with each of our partners - in our region and beyond.
South America is our immediate neighborhood. We strive for a prosperous and democratic South America. We are pursuing a growing convergence of integration processes in Latin America and the Caribbean. A significant example is the rapprochement between Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance. Together, the countries of the two groups form a market of almost 470 million people and account for over 90% of Latin America's GDP.
Africa is a continent to which we have strong historical and cultural ties, with which we want increasingly more cooperation initiatives and partnerships for development.
With Europe, where we cultivate old friendships, we intend to increase trade and investment flows.
And in Asia Pacific - the most dynamic hub of the global economy - we are intensifying our relationships with traditional partners and opening new fronts of exchange.
This is our foreign policy: a truly universalist one.
And, Mr. President, the most universal of the forums we have is this General Assembly.
Here we benefit from the most plural set of perspectives. Here we find the parameters and norms for respectful coexistence. And here we must become more united nations - for the development of our peoples, for the dignity of our citizens, and for the security of our planet.
Thank you very much."
Brunei_Darussalam,"Mr. President, Secretary-General, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have the great honour to convey the warm greetings of His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam to this august body.
And to His Excellency Miroslav Laj.k, our congratulations on assuming the Presidency of this session. We wish him much success in the coming year.
Also, our thanks to His Excellency Peter Thomson who has presided the Assembly with utmost dedication for the past year.
I also wish to send my warm wishes to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Antonio Guterres and praise him for his vision to strengthen our organisation.
Mr. President,
Two years ago, Brunei Darussalam proudly joined everyone to embark on an extended journey to achieve a global set of ambitious goals for sustainable development.
For us, that moment was meaningful. It signified our organisation's relentless pursuit to bring development and prosperity to all countries, regardless of their size and status in the world. It also showed us what unity can accomplish, despite our differences.
Our theme here has indeed summed up to who it is for: our people. It is therefore important that we fulfill our promise to them. A promise of a future where their hopes and dreams for a better livelihood can be realised. This will require our long-term commitment and significant investment.
In Brunei Darussalam, this means more than just building infrastructure or providing basic needs. It also means raising decent people. People who care for their society and are committed to their country's development and future. This calls for an inclusive approach, with a priority to focus on youth development.
in today's increasingly competitive environment, Brunei Darussalam firmly believes that quality education is the key to building a new generation of highly-skilled, innovative and confident young people.
1 of 4

Mr. President,
According to the ILO, it is estimated that over 291 million people around the world are unemployed this year. Therefore, creating job opportunities, especially for our young people, will be crucial in raising their standard of living.
In Brunei Darussalam, we are continuing our efforts to diversify our economy and advocate free trade bilaterally and regionally with an aim to achieve a dynamic and sustainable economy.
While pursuing economic progress, we should be mindful of the correlation between human activities and climate change. This is where the Paris Agreement can galvanise our collective action to give a cleaner, healthier, safe and sustainable planet for our future generations.
Brunei Darussalam will continue to do what it can to contribute positively towards this. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, our efforts rest on promoting efficiency in energy consumption and gradually deploying renewable energies.
At the same time, conserving our forests is a high priority and this complements well with our multilateral efforts, including the 'Heart of Borneo' initiative and recently, the 'Queen's Commonwealth Canopy'.
All in all, it is about educating our people to care for and protect our planet. Strengthening global efforts in this area is indeed important.
Mr. President,
Regional and international peace and security are crucial for human and economic developments to thrive. This is the basic foundation for ASEAN's success as it celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.
So, for the continued progress of Southeast Asia and the region at large, it is the responsibility of all concerned to ensure a stable, safe and secure environment, one that is free from conflict, war or threat of war.
We also strive for stronger engagement through confidence building, preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution through peaceful means. It is through these efforts and close cooperation among ourselves and with our external partners that ASEAN hopes to further contribute towards global peace and development.
2 of 4

Mr. President,
ASEAN's achievements over the past 50 years in ensuring regional peace and security have enabled Brunei Darussalam to pursue its development objectives in a peaceful and harmonious environment. We are pleased that our country has consistently achieved very high-ranking in UNDP's Human Development Index.
As the well-being of our people continues to be central to the nation, we therefore are mindful of the negative impact of security threats, in particular on our work to ensure a sustainable world.
Like many others, we are concerned with the constant threats of terrorism and violent extremism. Sadly, in various parts of the world, the casualties resulting from terrorist attacks continue to shock us all. We condemn such horrendous acts and convey our deepest sympathy as well as condolences to the families of the victims. We wish to reiterate that terrorism should not be linked to any particular race, religion, nationality or ethnicity.
To address these threats, it is important to examine the root causes of terrorism comprehensively such as poverty, marginalisation and alienation, notably among youth. It is our hope that by focusing on education, youth development, creating job opportunities, advocating the responsible use of social media, and promoting dialogue among different faiths and civilisations will greatly help in our effort to bring about positive change.
Equally important is to instil in our people's hearts and minds the values of peace, harmony, moderation and mutual respect. It is through these values that we may be able to create societies that are resilient to destructive ideologies. Working closely with youth, religious leaders and local communities, will be essential to help realise this. Hence, we welcome all efforts of the international community to prevent and eradicate terrorism and violent extremism in all their forms and manifestations.
Mr. President,
Also of great concern are pandemic diseases and natural disasters. On this note, I would also like to join others in expressing our condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims of the recent natural disasters that affected Mexico, Sierra Leone, the United States and countries in the Caribbean and South Asia.
Given their destructive effects on any country's development and welt-being, Brunei Darussalam values the work of all relevant agencies, including those under the UN, WHO and ASEAN. They provide us with avenues to gain expertise and knowledge on how to deal with the challenges posed by these threats.
3 of 4

Mr. President,
In our pursuit to leave no one behind, we should not forget the plight of those suffering from war, conflict and occupation.
Like everyone, the Palestinians also have hopes and dreams to be educators, doctors, engineers, artists, athletes and innovators, which are all for the good of humanity. However, for half a century, foreign occupation has tremendously hindered many of them from achieving their full human potential to contribute more towards global development.
Peace, freedom, justice and self-determination are Palestine's fundamental rights. As the legitimate and truly representative organisation on the planet, the UN has a moral and legal obligation to enforce these rights and ensure accountability for actions that contravene international law. We continue to count on the UN as well as all relevant parties concerned to find a comprehensive and lasting peace and stability in the region.
We have to press on with all efforts in translating the growing international recognition of the State of Palestine into positive changes on the ground, so that the Palestinians can pursue sustainable development in their own homeland.
Mr. President,
Brunei Darussalam looks up to the UN to address pressing issues around the world. It is important for the UN to enhance its working relationship with its network of partners, including regional organisations such as the OIC, Commonwealth and ASEAN. To better reflect the needs and realities of the 21st century, the world needs a stronger, more effective and efficient UN.
As such, we support our Secretary-General's ideas to reform the UN and re-position our organisation to focus more on conflict prevention measures, including mediation. We believe such endeavour will greatly help the UN optimise its work and resources, and above all, save lives, safeguard people's dignity, and promote peace and security around the world.
We want a UN that is fit for its purposes and principles as enshrined in the UN Charter. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of all member states to ensure that the United Nations truly live up to its name.
As we strive for a better future together, we hope for a successful United Nations. A successful United Nations means humanity benefits. When humanity benefits, we all win.
Thank you.

Bulgaria,"Mr. President,

Mr. Secretary General,

Excellencies,

Ladies and gentlemen.

It is an honour for me to address this distinguished forum. I congratulate His Excellency Miroslav Lajcak on his election to preside over the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly and wish him every success in his mission. I would also like to extend my warmest gratitude to His Excellency
Mr. Peter Thomson for his tireless work as President of the 71st Session in
promoting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
This Session is a special one for my country as within its timeframe - in the first semester of 2018 - Bulgaria will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
This year the General Debate puts a special emphasis on our common strive for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet highlighting the importance of prevention, mediation, sustainable development, preservation of the environment and respect for human rights through a people-centered approach. The United Nations upholds our shared goals of peace and security, development and human rights.

Mr. President,
Conflicts in many parts of the world continue to undermine international peace and security and the fundamental values of humanity. Outbreaks of violence devastate local economies, trigger large movements of refugees and migrants, cause massive spread of diseases, famine and immense human suffering. Children are usually the most adversely affected in any crisis situation. Root causes of armed conflicts should be addressed in a more systematic way through ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law, improving the economic situation and promoting social inclusion.

""Leaving no one behind"" and ""reaching the farthest behind first"" are not simply political declarations meant to invigorate Agenda 2030. If we are to transform our world by lifting it out of poverty, we need to implement fully the Sustainable Development Goals by promoting equality, inclusion and participation.
Protracted conflicts require a holistic UN response encompassing preventive diplomacy, mediation, peace-building and effective special political missions. This response is critical for restoring governance and stabilizing political, economic and social conditions in crisis and post-conflict countries.
Over the past several years the United Nations peace and security architecture has benefited from three peace and security reviews which, together with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, have provided a solid foundation for achieving peace and prosperity. In this regard, Bulgaria supports the 'surge in diplomacy for peace' which places prevention as an overarching priority of the UN's work and sets the stage for the necessary reforms to sustain peace. Prevention and mediation are essential means of reducing human suffering, including in addressing the root causes of forced displacements, bringing humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts together.
The situation in the Middle East and North Africa remains of deep concern and should be addressed in a comprehensive manner but the international
community should not be distracted from the urgent need to revive the Middle East Peace Process. Bulgaria reaffirms its position that the ""two-State solution"" formula is the realistic, just and lasting way to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is our belief that a solution which can fulfill the aspirations of both sides can be achieved only through direct negotiations, with no conditions and in conformity with the relevant international obligations.
Finding a political solution to the ongoing conflict in Syria and implementing a credible political transition in the country is essential for preserving the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian State. We support all actions aimed at achieving the earliest possible cessation to hostilities and conducting effective and constructive inter-Syrian negotiations in Geneva in order to achieve a lasting political solution to the crisis. We consider a political dialogue under the auspices of the UN as the only possible way to progressively improve the security situation in Syria and sustainably resolve the
humanitarian crisis.
Another source of deep concern for my country is the situation in Eastern Ukraine which, regrettably, remains highly precarious and volatile despite periodic ceasefire agreements. We reiterate our call for a swift and full implementation of the Minsk Agreements which have no viable alternative. We consistently support the activity of multilateral formats, such as the Normandy Four and the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group considering their key role in

advancing the political and diplomatic efforts for a peaceful settlement of the
conflict.
Bulgaria is fully committed to the peace and stabilization process in Afghanistan and considers reconciliation as a major prerequisite for stability and sustainable development in Afghanistan and beyond. We encourage the National Unity Government to continue with the needed reforms in key areas such as good governance, the rule of law, credible electoral process, countering corruption and narcotics, tackling gender and social issues.
Disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control are among the main pillars of international security and, hence, represent tangible aspects of the effort to achieve peace and decent life. Bulgaria reiterates its commitment to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, as well as to the objective to attain a world free of nuclear weapons. This goal is achievable only through the participation of all States, the nuclearweapon States in particular. We should aim at feasible but universal measures that will gradually and irreversibly lead to the final objective of a world without nuclear weapons. The next two steps in this direction could be the entry into force of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and the start of the negotiations on the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty at the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's nuclear program concluded in July 2015 remains of historic significance. Its full implementation is of great importance for regional and global stability. My country reiterates its full support for Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
Bulgaria categorically condemns the repeated nuclear tests and missile launches by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which lead to further escalation of the tensions in the region and undermine world peace and security. We call upon the DPRK to stop once and for all its nuclear and ballistic programs in a complete, irreversible and verifiable manner and to engage in a constructive dialogue with the international community. We reiterate our commitment to a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation.
The recent terrorist attacks are tragic reminders of the scale of the challenge ahead. Bulgaria shares the view that the newly established Counter-Terrorism Office marks a milestone in the efforts to improve United Nations efficiency in fighting terrorism by supporting the balanced implementation of the 2006 Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, strengthening coordination among the relevant UN agencies, funds and programmes, as well as promoting preventive
measures that address the drivers of extremism.

Bulgaria is deeply concerned by the unprecedented scale of organized looting of cultural property in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other countries in conflict or postconflict situation. We condemn illicit trafficking and illegal trade of cultural objects as a tactic of war and as a source of profit for financing terrorism. It is a threat that requires a global response. A number of legal instruments and resolutions have been adopted by UNESCO, the UN, the European Parliament, etc. We have laid the legal foundations and it is our common duty to ensure their full implementation. The Antiquities coalition, UNESCO's ""Unite for Heritage"" social-media campaign and other activities epitomize a very positive global trend for action aimed at preservation and protection of the world's cultural heritage.
Mr. President,
International migration is a global phenomenon and only through joint efforts, such as the Global Compact on Migration, we can ensure a balanced approach which includes respect for international humanitarian and human rights law, as well as effective border management and readmission. States have rights and responsibilities to manage and control their borders as a central element of their national security. Strict border control is of utmost importance, in particular in the context of preventing irregular migration and eradicating human trafficking. For Bulgaria the top priority is the effective management and control of the EU's external border allowing for the smooth functioning of free movement within the European Union.
Climate change continues to represent one of the biggest challenges of our time. Not only it impedes the well-being of our countries but also poses security threats to many of them. Bulgaria stands by its obligations undertaken by the Paris Agreement and believes that only a universal approach to its implementation can achieve the goals of the UN climate change agenda.
Mr. President,
Bulgaria is strongly committed to the promotion of human rights and is actively involved in a number of intergovernmental processes dedicated to the advancement of the human rights agenda globally. As co-chair of the Group of Friends of Children and the Sustainable Development Goals at the UN, Bulgaria strongly advocates for integrating children's rights in all major intergovernmental processes as the real agents of positive social change. As President of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for the period 2017 - 2018 Bulgaria actively promotes the full inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities on an equal basis
with others.

Bulgaria is determined to further contribute to promoting human rights internationally as member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2019 2021 and would rely on partners' valuable support for its candidacy.
In the last few decades the UN has made crucial steps to advance gender equality and women's empowerment. These efforts should be further strengthened in order to achieve tangible results for women and girls on the ground by eliminating all forms of gender-based violence and discrimination. Ensuring equal rights for women and men should be an integral part of every day policies in all spheres of life. Promoting equality, countering discrimination and ensuring respect for human rights are key to achieving lasting peace and sustainable development and we believe that the protection of human rights should be placed at the center of all action undertaken by the UN.
Mr. President,
The world is currently facing enormous challenges, maybe the greatest that humanity has ever encountered, and we, the Member States of the United Nations, must provide the solution. It is time to take action.
Thank you, Mr. President!"
Cabo_Verde,"Mr. President of the General Assembly Mr. Secretary General Excellences Heads of State, of Government and of Delegation Ladies and Gentlemen
It is with great satisfaction and honor that I take part in this august Assembly, gathered here at its 72nd session.
I bring with me the friendly greetings of the Cabo Verdean People living in the country and in the diaspora.

I wanted to salute the President of the 71st session of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson, who focused his leadership on implementing the sustainable development goals.
I am pleased to reiterate the congratulations of my Government to Mr. Ant6nio Guterres for his election to the post of Secretary-General. The Government of Cabo Verde will lend its full support to the Secretary-General's work, especially in carrying out the reforms he has announced--and which are in progress--to strengthen the delivery capacity, transparency and accountability of our Organization.
I would like to welcome the President of the 72nd session of the General Assembly, Mr. Miroslav LAJC,K, and to wish him all the success. We listened with particular interest to the six-point-program he announced for his presidency, and which are all interlinked and geared towards ensuring the protection, dignity and well-being of people.
Indeed, the theme proposed by Your Excellency for the 72nd session could not be more appropriate, given the underlying objective of your program--bringing the United Nations ever closer to the people.
Cabo Verde prides itself on being a Nation with five and a half centuries of history, having built a Creole ideritity of its own at the junction between Africa and Europe, while also being open to the world, with a significant diaspora in several countries, and the embodiment of the peaceful coexistence, we wish to see in all nations.
2

As a small island country, with sparse natural resources and devoid of mineral resources, we know that we can only affirm ourselves in the concert of nations and in the global economic system with political, institutional and social stability; with cosmopolitanism; by being trustworthy in our relations with development partners and investors; by upholding the values of democracy, freedom, human dignity and full citizenship; by the quality of our institutions and the excellence of our human resources. Although intangible, these are our greatest assets, and are the foundation of our development process.
Our only option is to value these assets, to make them distinctive and focused on those who truly are development actors and beneficiaries: the children, youths, women and men of any country.
I raise these points in agreement with how appropriate it is to ""Focus on People"". Women and men in any country need political, institutional, social, economic and educational environments that release their creative energy, their capacity for innovation, capacity to learn, to work, to cooperate and to trust, to self-organize and to be accountable. This is only possible in environments of peace and security, and which create a notion of the future in people, as opposed to simply living each day at a time, beset with unease and limited horizons.
Mr. President

The People and Government of Cabo Verde are concerned with the current international context, where not only old disputes persist, but also where we witness new internal political crises, armed conflicts, terrorist acts, organized crime of trafficking in drugs, in people, in weapons and piracy, as well as other transnational ideological trends, such as populism, racial supremacy, xenophobia and intolerance to human and cultural diversity.
These damages are detrimental to global peace as they cause human suffering, claim lives and instigate other humanitarian tragedies, such as the unprecedented increase in the number of refugees, hunger, and forms of violence against women and children. Likewise, they undermine the Rule of Law, weaken democracy, threaten the territorial integrity of States, corrupt the basis for economic and social progress, and endanger coexistence at both the national and international levels.
These damages, unfortunately, do not spare any region in a globalized world.
The threats to security are global, the challenges too. The opportunities for their effective combat are also global, and a permanent representation of Africa in the Security Council is therefore fully jUstified. The Government of Cabo Verde supports a Reform of the Security Council to have it reflect the evolution of today's world by integrating a permanent representation of Africa in its broad composition. In our view, considering that the positions of both sides have already been sufficiently advanced, we believe that it is time to start negotiations based on
a text.
4

Mr, President
Thanks to the United Nations, humanity has for the first time a holistic and comprehensive Agenda that offers a real opportunity for sustainable and inclusive development. Not only because it integrates the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, but also because it considers the cross-cutting issues of peace, security, justice and necessary partnerships, and also because it makes an appeal to <<leave no one behind>>.
Now, two years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the challenges lie in its implementation.
The United Nations must therefore be able to play a catalytic role in forming consensus and mobilizing resources to make a difference on the implementation, funding, and capacity building fronts.
In this regard, we would like to commend the Secretary-General's ongoing exercise, which aims to adapt the United Nations development system, as well as reform the Secretariat's management structures to fit the challenges of implementing the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs.

In the same vein, intense focus should be placed on the particular situation of middle-income countries, including Small Island Developing States that have graduated, such as Cabo Verde. There is a lack of a common response approach to this category of countries in terms of new metrics for a more systemic assessment of their financing needs and structural vulnerabilities.
Mr. President,
For Small Island Developing States, a swift and rapid implementation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement is a priority. It must be a priority for the whole world.
Cabo Verde expresses its solidarity with the victims of recent hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, Barbuda, St. Bartholomew, San Martin and other fantastic islands in the Caribbean.
If there have always been hurricanes, the bad news is that with climate change they tend to be more frequent, more cruel and more destructive. The consequences are devastating for regions and countries that are most vulnerable from an environmental and economic point of view, such as small island states and regions. Every new day is late for vigorous and globalized action on the factors that trigger and accelerate climate change. Each island that disappear because of climate change will be a nightmare for humanity.
Mr. President

For Cabo Verde, the Rule of Law and democracy are not only an option, but also above all, a necessity to ensure objective, transparent and predictable governance, both nationally and internationally. The internal order of Cabo Verde is aligned with international positions and practices in the field of Human Rights through the Constitution of the Republic, its laws, institutions, public policies and social practices.
We recognize, however, that there have been difficulties within the United Nations in harmonizing positions for the universalization of Human Rights principles and practices, and that we must pursue that objective through dialogue and respect between Parties.
In this regard, I would like to emphasize the Secretary-General's initiatiVe to establish a Pact with Member States, as well as a Circle of Leadership on the prevention and response to sexual exploitation and abuse in all UN operations -and, above .all, in the context of peacekeeping and humanitarian actions. That initiative will give greater dignity to the most vulnerable people, especially women and girls, and will promote their rights.
A supporter of international relations governed by International Law, Cabo Verde actively participates in the codification of laws by joining and taking part in negotiations, as well as by signing, ratifying and implementing most of the international instruments in the most varied domains.
7

In this context, Cabo Verde has recent!y deposited the instruments of ratification of the Paris Agreement,on climate change, and signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was concluded in New York on July 7th, 2017. We would like to convey our satisfaction with the success of the preparatory work towards developing an international legal instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Moreover, we support the convening of a Diplomatic Conference during 2018 to work on a Convention on this issue, which should have safeguards for the specific situation of Small Island States.
The conclusion of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was a historic moment in the fight against impunity for those responsible for the most serious crimes against humanity, and we would therefore like to express the strongest support of Cabo Verde to the ICC. Strengthening this Court is an obligation the present generation has towards future ones.
Mr. President,
As written by the poet and songwriter, and later sung by the Diva Cesria Ivora, Cabo Verde is described as being <<ten little grains of sand>) in the middle of the Atlantic.

Despite our smallness, we want to make Cabo Verde a country with relevance in the Middle Atlantic in terms of economic stature, security, and diplomacy for peace and the promotion of freedom and democracy.
We intend to position Cabo Verde as a transit hub in the MiddleAtlantic for tourism, air transport, port operations, financial and investment operations, business localization and business development in the Digital and NanoTechnological Economy, and in the attraction of investments and skills from the
diaspora.
cabo Verde promotes collective and cooperative security systems, as the transnational nature of crime and the location of the country so require.
Cabo Verde aims to position itself as a useful interlocutor in the concert of nations for dialogue, peace and tolerance. Its history and location have transformed Cabo Verde into a country resulting from mergers between Europe and Africa--a country of easy relations with all the countries of the world. We want to value and develop these assets strategically.
This is our vision and purpose. They are captured in the Strategic Plan for Sustainable Development (PEDS), which is already completed and aligned with the SDGs.
9

Partnerships are an integral and indispensable part of the 2030 Agenda, and national ownership will find in them an unquestionable complement so that the Strategic Plan for Sustainable Development can succeed, with the United Nations at the forefront.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General Excellences Ladies and Gentlemen
Happiness is the ultimate right to which the people of the whole world aspire. The 2030 Agenda has endowed the World not only with a Vision, but also a Roadmap to bring happiness to the people and leave no one behind in the path to sustainable development.
In 1945, the Peoples of the United Nations showed their determination to lead Humanity in a different course than War. Today, with the 2030 Agenda, they will be able to determine another course for Humanity, for People who still struggle with poverty and the absence of alternatives for their development.
10

It is in our hands--the Peoples of the United Nations--to support both the Secretary-General and the President of the 72nd session of the General Assembly in this honorable and grandiose task of advancing the Happiness Agenda. A great THANK YOU to everyone.
11"
Cambodia,"Your Excellency Mr. President,
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
1. On behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia and on my own behalf, I congratulate you, Excellency Miroslav Laj^^k, on your election as President of the 72nd United Nations General Assembly. I would like to take this opportunity to thank as well His Excellency President Peter Thomson of Fiji for his commitment and dedication to the works of our previous UNGA session. I join with previous speakers in expressing my deepest condolences and sympathy to the victims of the earthquake in Mexico and their families.
2. My Delegation finds that the theme of this year's UNGA is extremely relevant and sums up quite appropriately the six overarching priorities of your Presidency which are responsive to the global megatrends that are facing our world nowadays. The interactions between population growth, massive migration movements, climate change and food insecurity render these megatrends all the more worrisome.
3. Similarly, the same forces of globalization, which in the past have made us so interdependent, are exposing deep flaws in the existing international order. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world became by many measures more complex and challenging than ever before. Today, our multipolar world has gained its prominence in global affairs, causing chaos and turbulence as competition between the major powers is becoming more confrontational; we are more interdependent, but more imequal; we are more prosperous, and yet millions are still afflicted with poverty. All
these factors have contributed to a sense of a world out of balance, and this
is the paradox that defines our world today.


4. While sharing our deep concern on the situation in the Korean peninsula, we appeal to all parties concerned to further exercise their utmost restraint to avoid provocative activities and remain committed to the peaceful and constructive dialogue so as to diffuse tension and promote trust and confidence in the region. Another factor that destabilizes the collective security is the unilateral and illegal embargo on Cuba. We ask that this violation of the international law be brought to an end.
5. Mr President, it is true that globalization and technological progress have dramatically increased global trade and wealth all over the world but it is equally true that they have been factors of increase of inequality, social tensions and sometimes conflicts. These fragilities, to a large extent, are responsible for many of the conflicts and threats today.
6. One of those threats is terrorism from which no coimtry is spared. To defeat this transnational threat would require a firm global resolve to address in the most comprehensive way this scourge in all its forms, starting from addressing the symptoms and root causes of radicalization, confronting issues of Foreign Fighters and terrorism financing and other forms of
support.
7. Mr. President, let me touch upon two topics of relevance to this year's UNGA theme, namely the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Climate Change.
8. The 2030 Agenda is inextricably linked to many issues that perturb the world today, the most pressing one being climate change, which is not only a direct threat in itself but also a multiplier of many other threats ~ from poverty, diseases and food security to mass migrations and regional


conflicts. In our view. Climate Change is a global Human Security issue that presents a serious and imprecedented threat to global peace and security. 9. Cambodia is regularly ranked among the top ten most vulnerable coimtries globally with extreme weather events damaging our infrastructure, severely impacting on agriculture, disrupting economic activities and hampering crucial social services for our vulnerable groups. While our contribution to climate change is negligible and our domestic resources quite limited, we have made nonetheless clear commitments to low carbon development and look forward to developing partnerships with other progressive nations who are committed to addressing this formidable challenge in a cooperative
and fair manner.
20.1 am pleased to note that the Paris Climate Agreement acknowledges the principles of 'Common but Differentiated Responsibilities', meaning based on the respective capabilities and different national conditions.
11.Indeed, the 2030 Agenda is our boldest agenda for humanity but it is an agenda aiming at a fair globalization. Cambodia has demonstrated its commitment to sustainable development over the past two decades. Concretely, our target of reducing the poverty rate to 19.5% by 2015 was achieved ahead of schedule. We have received a UN Award for halving hunger before the deadline. Cambodia is also among the top seven performers globally for its improvements in Human Development Index
between 1990 and 2015.
12.Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen. Speaking about peace and security, Cambodia is proud of its unwavering commitment to the UN peacekeeping efforts. More than 2 decades ago Cambodia received the UN Blue Berets on their peacekeeping mission. Since 2006, we have dispatched more than 4,700 troops to take part with great success and praise in UN peacekeeping missions in a number of coimtries that are hot spots in the


world, like Sudan, South Sudan, Lebanon, Central African Republic, Chad, Syria and Mali. 13.As you all know, peacekeeping operations are not without security risks. Peacekeepers continue to come under attack from armed groups and increasingly from terrorists. Last May, rebel ambushes in the Central African Republic have killed and woimded our Cambodian peacekeepers. Let's pay our tribute to those who have died while serving under the UN Flag and remind ourselves to acknowledge their contributions in the transformation of many coimtries from battlefields to peaceful States. 14.Mr. President, I now wish to address the issues of human rights and democracy since my coimtry is regularly targeted by some countries, some UN agencies as well as by those international NGOs active in these fields. 15.1 wish to reiterate that Cambodia upholds itself to the universal principle of fundamental human rights and therefore we do not see any issue of incompatibility with regards to the respect for national sovereignty as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations vis-^-vis the monitoring of the application of these rights, provided that it be done in an impartial manner, that it takes into accoimt all the pertinent factors on the groimd, and that there is neither prejudice nor conjecture on the part of observers against the democratically elected authorities. 16.So, what are the realities? 1 can go straight to the point! The assessment of the human rights situation varies depending on the political predisposition of certain great powers. The same reasoning holds true for the big international NGOs, whose agenda are far from being politically neutral. 17.The issue of human rights and democracy is raised only when the specific interests of certain major powers are at stake, at the vagaries of the moment. Otherwise, it is sheer silence, and often a conspiracy of silence.


18.speaking of the deliberate political manipulation in the name of human rights and democracy, my country have suffered such prejudice for more than 12 years during which time the international community has denied the existence of the worst mass crimes. As a survivor of the Pol Pot genocidal regime, it pains me to hear nowadays the Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Cambodia referring to the crimes perpetrated by this regime as
mere ""troubles"".
19.We are relentlessly assailed by incessant criticism on matters that are reported partially and in a biased manner. These reports without fail always condemn the government and portrays the oppositions as martyrs of democracy and human rights. Invariably, they are purposely drafted to go against the government. At no time, the wrongdoings and illegal behaviors of the opposition are mentioned.
20.1 am keen to know which country as represented in this General Assembly would refrain from taking actions when their opposition politicians incite people to remove border posts, inflame the crowd with heinous racist remarks, publish false treaties and fake maps to make the people believe that some parts of the country are annexed by the neighboring state? Which coxmtry endorses defamation and slander? In most coimtries, calls for racial hatred, xenophobic statements and speeches of the extreme right are severely denounced, or even condemned, as we have just seen with the events of Charlottesville. While they are the daily language of the Cambodian opposition, never had it been condemned nor raised by NGOs and the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Cambodia.
21.The most recent attacks on the Royal Government of Cambodia pertarn to the expulsion of an institute affiliated with a foreign political party which, imder the cover of democracy training, deliberately supports the opposition and violates our law; the closure of a tax delinquent foreign newspaper; and


the arrest of an opposition official who, in a video recorded interview, confessed to be an agent of a big power working to overthrow our government. In what country, would such behavior of a foreign government be tolerated? We have acted totally in accordance with the provisions stipulated in our specific laws and 1can assure you that these actions are not arbitrary as some critics would have led you to believe the contrary. 22.We can leam an important lesson from the history of my country: when we have been forced to choose the path set by some Western powers, we ended up suffering its worst consequences as manifested by one of the most horrific human tragedies of the last century. 23.We must recognize that it is the Cambodian government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Hun Sen, that has secured full peace for the coimtry in 1998 with its own wisdom and means. We must admit that certain practices imposed from the outside are often forming part of the problem, not the solution. 24.Today we are accused of imdermining democracy because, under existing laws, we are prosecuting and punishing people who violate these laws.
Those who criticize us, even threaten us, refuse to take into consideration
the crimes committed under the law by those whom they protect. 25.Mr. President. While acknowledging with sincere gratitude the great and
positive contribution that many countries have brought to peace and economic development of our country, I will conclude by saying that the discourse of certain governments on human rights and democracy will be relevant and credible only when these coimtries choose to subject
themselves first to the same standards as others when it come to their own
assessments, criticisms and condemnations.
Thank you."
Cameroon,"Mr. President,  Heads of State and Government,
 The Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization,
 Heads of Delegation,
I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as Chair of this session of the United Nations General Assembly. I do believe you will be served by your rich experience in successfully steering our proceedings. You can count
on the full cooperation of my delegation.
My congratulations also go to Ambassador Peter THOMSON, your predecessor and the architect of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda,
on his commendable record.
Lastly, I would like, once more, to congratulate Mr. Antonio GUTERRES on his unanimous election as Secretary-General of our
Organization.
Mr. Secretary-General, please rest assured of Cameroon's constant support in the performance of your lofty and delicate duties.
 Ladies and Gentlemen,
This session is being held within a global context marked by
multiple hotbeds of tension worldwide, where terrorism continues to affect thousands of people, where human activity is causing climate disruptions, and where poverty is far from declining. However, it is also taking place in parallel
with laudable efforts towards implementing the Sustainable Development
Agenda designed to ensure Humanity's fulfilment so that no one is left behind.
Hence the full pertinence of the general debate under the theme, (I quote) Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a
Sustainable Planet"".
Our debates and, especially, our conclusions, will constitute a litmus test of our commitment to the Ideal of the peoples of the United Nations who, in the preamble to the Charter, state their resolve to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war, and to promote social progress and
better standards of life for all peoples.
 Mr. President,
For Cameroon and most of our States, peace is the sine qua non for the survival of humanity and for sustainable development. Such peace remains dangerously under threat, notably from terrorism, conflicts, poverty and climate disruptions. Today, I would say, we are all ""beggars for peace"". And such persistent threats are of utmost concern to us all.

Mr. President,
Today, no continent, no country Is spared by the scourge of terrorism, the atrocities of which unfortunately have become part and parcel of daily life. Let me mention a few examples:
- August 2017, attacks in Barcelona and Ouagadougou; - July 2016, bombing of Baghdad: 292 dead; - October 2015, crash of a Russian Airbus in the Sinai: 224 dead; - March 2015, attack of mosques in Sana'a: 142 dead; - November 2015, attacks in Paris and Saint Denis: 130 dead, ...
Maiduguri, Kolofata, Fotokol ..., conjure up nothing but nameless,
faceless bodies... The number of victims of the Boko-Haram terrorist sect in the Lake Chad basin is estimated at 2000. Cameroon and other neighbouring countries are confronted with the sect and its constantly changing methods
and tactics. We appreciate the support from our partners in this struggle
against barbarism.
The fight against this jihadist sect, Boko-Haram, requires more widespread mobilization if we must stamp out its threat. It is killing our
peoples, our communities, our independence and our democracy. It spells death for peace. In this regard, we look forward to the arrival in the Lake Chad region of the high-level mission the Security Council mandated the UN
Secretary-General to field under resolution 2349.
 Mr. President,
We condemn continuing conflicts in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, which are wreaking pain and hardship ... so many dead ... so many refugees and displaced persons ... so many children roaming about without a roof over their heads and facing an uncertain or even shattered
future...
Cameroon, which has hosted and continues to host thousands of refugees from the Central African Republic and Nigeria, understands how much they feel hurt, victihriized and threatened in their very existence.
Therefore, let us mobilize and, through our policies, behaviours and
actions, re-focus on people.
 Ladies and Gentlemen,
Peace is under threat not only from terrorism and conflicts, but also
from persisting poverty. The Security Council has most appropriately reiterated

that poverty is a serious threat. How then can one understand that we have
difficulty tackling it accordingly?
The numerous declarations and resolutions, the various United
Nations development decades, as well as the plans of action and other agendas adopted by the United Nations are not fully effective. The result is clear: poverty persists and the gap between rich and poor countries is ever widening. This situation is exacerbated by the decline in commodity prices.
Mr. President, let us all mobilize In a powerful surge of solidarity to roll back poverty. Let us match our actions with our words. In so doing, we will be providing conditions for a decent life to our people...; let us thus focus on People!
 Mr. President,
We must, for present and future generations, save our planet. We therefore welcome the Paris Climate Agreement, which Cameroon, I recall, was among the first countries to sign and ratify. We are pleased that steps are being taken to Implement it effectively.
I would like to take this opportunity to strongly reiterate the legitimate and unanimous wish of developing countries. As we all know, these countries pollute less, and should thus receive from rich countries, which pollute more, multifarious wherewithal to effectively promote the goals of the Paris Agreement at their level.
For Africa, there are two major challenges.
Firstly, ongoing forest degradation in Central Africa. Let us save the Congo Basin, the earth's second lung.
Secondly, the desertification affecting Lake Chad, which is disappearing. This vast body of water, which is essential for the survival of communities and biodiversity, has already lost 90% of its initial surface. Let us
save Lake Chad!
By so doing, we will be contributing towards preserving the planet for the greater good of humanity.
 Mr. President,

The quest for peace concerns us all. All countries must pool forces
to achieve peace.
Therefore, is it not yet time for the voice of poor countries, especially those of Africa, to be heard?
Is it not time, or rather high time, Africa's message to the World were better
taken into account?
Is it not high time we restructured our Organization to give more weight to Africa's voice within a revitalized General Assembly, a Security Council that is more receptive and equitable to us?
A world characterized by greater solidarity is the sine qua non for peace on earth.
 Mr. President,
Let me now conclude. Peace is our most precious asset. Without
peace, we cannot take any sustainable and effective initiative in the interest of
our youth and our peoples.
The theme of the debate aptly reminds us of the commitment of the founding fathers of the United Nations, namely to:
- save succeeding generations from the scourge of war; and - guarantee a decent life for all, free from want, through cooperation.
This debate urges us to renew our faith in the ideals and purposes
of the United Nations.
Let us together take up the great challenge of world peace and
development.
Once again Cameroon, as it did from this very rostrum on 10 September 2000, urges the world to rally together in one great coalition for humanity placed back at the centre of our policies. For its sake, let us secure peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet.
Thank you, Mr. President."
Costa_Rica,"President of the Seventy-Second Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Mr, Miroslav Lajdk
Excellencies, Head of State and Government,
Distinguished delegates,
Dear friends,
Mr. President, Costa Rica congratulates you for your appointment and celebrates the priorities you have established under your leadership. I want to reiterate my country's commitment to work with you, along with the other Member States, in order to set the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, enforce without delay the Paris and Marrakech commitments, implement the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and reinforce world governance and multilateralism as spaces to preserve international peace and stability.
Mr. President,
Each word, declaration, and action adopted at these premises keeps alive Kant's hope and inspiring faith in humanity. Building a world from the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement, Beijing+20, Treaties on the Non-Proliferation of Weapons, and Treaties on the Prohibition and Disarmament of Nuclear Weapons, reveals that we are aware of the multiple challenges that we, Human Communities, face. We recall our firm belief in cooperative response to the most pressing issues to humanity. At the same time, these recent milestones are inspired by the enlightened understanding of those who, before us, and under critical conditions, stood up for a decent coexistence, defended Liberty as life mandate, and kept hope alive as a daily imperative.
As world leaders, we are charged with directing our people towards Sustainable Development. The ethical power of our actions should not be limited to our domestic policies, but transcend to this Assembly, where active engagement can generate well-being and tackle inequality, injustice, and violence, even if this implies generating inconvenience to those who refuse the world to be an open, unbiased, and inspiring hearth for us all. Thus, this aspiration has resistance and misconceptions.
2

Before the walls of shortsightedness and evil, Costa Rica has always chosen honest work; our lack of stature has not limited our restless capacity to give generously to others. As the main values for the full observance of human rights, my country has chosen compassion, solidarity, and peace-building. Our values has converted International Law, active multilateralism, and the rejection of environmental predation into the ideal mechanisms for conflict resolution inside and among world states. This is, essentially, our commitment to humankind.
COSTA RICA: THE FIRST COUNTRY TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT TO MEET SDG OBJECTIVES
In September 2016, Costa Rica became the first country to establish a national agreement to meet SDG Objectives. We included a special provision to include, along the process, the Heads of the Supreme Powers of the Republic, local government representatives, the business sector, religious groups, social organizations, and academia. They have actively engaged their agendas in the implementation of the SDG Objectives.
This initiative aligned the Plan Nacional de Desarrollo (National Development Plan) 2015-2018 with both the SDG's and targets for national and local programs and projects. Through consensus building, dialogue, and accountability, the PND established the functional strategy for SDG planning, implementation and follow-up.
Two years ago at this Assembly, I stated that Costa Rica committed to the design and implementation of the appropriate tools to wage a real and sustainable campaign against poverty. Given the multidimensional nature of poverty, we implemented the Multidimensional Poverty Index along with a functional and multi-actor governance structure. This became one of the most important breakthroughs. We reduced poverty in Costa Rica for the first time in the last seven years. This was achieved through an articulated and coordinated decision-making process, draft of initiatives, and implementation of domestic strategy.
On the occasion of the United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, Costa Rica and another 42 countries submitted a national voluntary report on the implementation of the SDG objectives. In this sense, Costa Rica, along with the other member countries of the Central American Integration System, sponsored the harmonization of the regional agenda with these objectives.
3

Costa Rica is aware of the integral, universal, and multidimensional nature of the SDG. Therefore, we believe implementation requires political and governance innovation. Leaving no-one behind is a State and government responsibility, but these entities should not act alone. This is why, the 2030 Agenda should be based on consensus, generating synergy, creative participation, and on the commitment of multiple stakeholders and productive sectors. It should be based above all on this Assembly's commitment and call to action since leaving no-one behind--more than a motto--is a compelling call to action for all sectors in society.
I emphasize, therefore, the content and quality of Secretary-General's report on the repositioning of the UN development system to honour the ambitious 2030 Agenda objectives. I consider this to be the appropriate route to coordinate and undertake global actions that will respond to current and future specific Sustainable Development needs.
Within this framework, it is necessary to think about the needs of middle income countries. I find it convenient to continue working on these efforts and on the interests of these countries so the United Nations system offers efficient, focused, and best coordinated support.
In these regards, Costa Rica wants to emphasize the importance, for other countries as well as the UN system of, rethinking the concept of per capita income as a reference for determining a country's development. Only a multidimensional vision of development, especially a multidimensional vision of poverty, will allow us to understand the needs of populations, families and their members in terms of access to healthcare, social equality, gender equality, and address social, economic, and environmental vulnerabilities, among other challenges of developing countries.
With all due respect, but with urgency, I request the Secretary General to promote spaces that will implement working strategies to strengthen the capabilities of these countries and will allow more efficiency when cooperating with middle-income and least developed countries.
For these countries, meeting the sustainable development goals will be impossible unless the economic, social and environmental problems are incorporated to the global roadmaps. As a universal forum, the UN system is in a privileged position to consolidate a cooperative strategy with middle income countries.

Changing Development and institutional Entrenchment
With indisputable authority, Amartya Sen has stated that in order to talk about development of any society, it is mandatory to analyse the life of its members. Economic success is not possible without taking the quality of life of the communities into account. That is, the quality of life of each of
their members.
In this regard, minority groups that have been historically excluded from the full realization of their rights and those societies hosting them, must be given special regard to meet the 2030 Agenda.
We must be especially attentive of productive sectors such as family farming. Family Farming is the main source of income for 70% of the poor rural population worldwide, that is 40% of the world's population. Around 500 million of small farms provide 80% of the food consumed by developing countries, becoming, in many cases, the historical basis of the productive development of entire nations, as is the case in my country.
Family farming is essential to meet the sustainable development goals since it encompasses, in a comprehensive way, the SDG goals. It is the basis of sustainable food production, is essential for the environmental management of rural and marine territories where it is developed, and to biodiversity, it is the source of remarkable cultural manifestations of communities, and, is definitely, the cornerstone of countries' comprehensive development.
From this perspective, Costa Rica, along with countries from different parts of the world, will have the honour to present during this session a resolution stating ""the Decade of Family Farming 2019-2028"", inspired by the success of the International Year of Family Farming approved by the General Assembly in 2014.
WOMEN EMPOWERMENT
Gender equality, Mr. President, remains an objective of the greatest importance for all countries. Every day, women strive for a world where the full recognition and exercise of their rights is more tangible. Their fights are inherent to the building of truly democratic societies and the inclusive coexistence in all our countries. Even more, the fight to achieve full women's rights is an exercise that needs to be fully implemented to make the SDG's a reality within the time expected by this Organization.
5

Literature is extensive and political declarations are decisive by stressing the sensible democratic deficit and prejudices in terms of development derived from persistent patriarchal structures forged in former times, but remained perpetuated today because of the lack of education on rights and respect for democratic coexistence.
Gender inequality is not an alien topic that manifests in a hidden way within the inner relations of countries beyond our sight. Inequality is everywhere before our eyes. Take a moment to look around; it is imperative to take concrete actions and make more women our peers fully at these important
premises.
My country has understood this commitment and embraces the proposals of the International Gender Champions which aim to reverse gender inequality within the United Nations and take specific actions in this 72nd Session to call upon these gender champions in order to promote gender balance within the delegations attending the General Debate during the high-level week of the General Assembly.
Women's effective participation in the economic sectors of their societies has a deep and significant impact in other areas of autonomy because a woman economically empowered is a person with the tools and capabilities necessary to make a positive impact in her community.
While it is true that many women work, are entrepreneurs, and work in the public and private sectors, millions work in the informal sector, and others do domestic work and unpaid care. It is estimated that the unpaid work of women is equivalent to 10,000 million US dollars per year, or 13% of the world GDP. However, if I were to choose a singular insulting and absurd example of this discrimination, the one that causes me the most indignation is that the average woman's salary is 25% lower the average man's for the same job.
I had the honour to co-chair the High-Level Panel on Women's Economic Empowerment along with Mrs. Simona Scarpaleggia, CEO of IKEA Switzerland, at the request of the former Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and UN Women. The final report, in which women worldwide participated, concludes that:
 it is essential to expand social protection coverage and the access to justice with due process;
6

0 Care is also an economic activity which contribution should be reflected in the country's productivity. Men should have a shared responsibility of fulfilling this labour and private companies as well as public institutions must facilitate it;
 women have the challenge of accessing digital and financial services as well as being tenures in land redistribution;
,, it is necessary that enterprises recognize women leadership;
 it is urgent that macroeconomic policies of States empower women and promote decent jobs;
 laws causing and perpetuating discrimination must be amended and those encouraging equality must be enacted;
affirmative policies on hiring women must be extended to public institutions and private companies and women-owned businesses must be promoted;
 it is necessary to reinforce the support to informal workers and agricultural workers.
With no hesitation, it is necessary to adopt a multidimensional and intersectoral strategyto add ress the barriers to women's economic em powe rment. In this sense, Costa Rica has a public policy that guarantees women's employability on an equal basis. As its main objective, this policy addresses the work access and permanence gap, which main actor is the private sector, as the main source of employment and national development. This practice is part of the new tendency of international markets and global economy, where companies seek to increase their productivity through innovation, improvement of work environment, talent attraction, and adoption of value and practices under a Human Rights-based approach.
Nevertheless, we recognize that multiple challenges remain towards substantive equality for women. Our determination is to achieve women's incorporation in paid work, with measures that eradicate division based on sex in the workplace and facilitate economic autonomy and high quality of life as necessary conditions for the full enjoyment of Human Rights.
Today, I would like to recognize all women on Earth. You are capable
7

enough to move ahead despite the rigid and rude patriarchal heritage that tends to not acknowledge your abilities and accomplishments and that fills with doubts and dangers your road towards your full autonomy. You are an example for others: your internal strength leads you to break the chains of oppression, rise above tearing migrations and forced displacement, free entire communities for unexpected forms of slavery. And within this grim march that your life is, you devote with deep passion to your people, with whom you are sensible and protective even when your love and generosity are not understood nor repaid. You are masters of resilience, since you have learned how to deal with the wrong people and painful moments. You know how to fulfil your roles of mother, partner, friend, or leader and you dedicate to them even if you need to sacrifice yourself because of a superior responsibility, a greater good that you accomplish with sincere devotion, aware of the risks and bearing in mind that you are an example to other women that follow your steps.
Definitely, it's not easy being a Khaleesi. Whether in fiction or in real life, the goal of equality is much greater than we that are circumstantially here. Today is a good day to look ourselves in the mirror, start to create truly equal relations, and take this long night to its end.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. President,
Our grandparents could not foresee the consequences that industrialization and business models would have on climate. We, grandparents of future generations, can. That is why we cannot be indifferent. It is true that for many decades humanity has had the resources and scientific knowledge to measure with precision the behaviour of endless variables related to the environment and can design future scenarios of weather conditions in different world regions and their impact on humans and their social, productive, and cultural activities. These capabilities commit us at levels seldom achieved throughout the history of humankind. We are endorsed by an ethic responsibility about the future of life on Earth and the interaction between human groups and their environment.
There is enough evidence to support the idea that a transformative solution to climate change is within human capabilities. That is why we welcome the French initiative of the Global Pact for the Environment, which would complement the legal framework of the international agreements adopted by the UN in 1966. We also express our great satisfaction in being a member
8

of the group of friends that under the leadership of Slovenia, Switzerland, Morocco, the Maldives, and Costa Rica, promotes the resolution on Human Rights and the Environment, articulated within the Human Rights Council.
Also, along with countries of the Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC, in Spanish), we have exercised a positive leadership position in the negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, building bridges between the negotiating groups and making
proposals.
Our countries, Mr. President, must adopt increasingly ambitious positions on environmental conservation as well as in the fight against climate change, understanding them as the ineluctable right of every human being and future generations of living in a healthy and ecologically balanced
environment.
Mr. President, please count on the unconditional and unrestricted support of the Costa Rican people in promoting this vital agenda.
With satisfaction, I would like the plenary to know that the shared leadership of Chile and Costa Rica has caused Latin America to move towards establishing a regional instrument on the rights of access to information, participation, and justice on environmental matters.
This initiative seeks to produce more effective agreements in the context of socio-environmental conflicts through an environmental governance scheme, in which the State acts as facilitator in agreement and decisionmaking spaces with the participation of all interested and affected stakeholders. It includes the principles of precaution, repair, and nonregression.
We reaffirm the aspiration of directing our economy towards carbon neutrality as part of Pre-2020 voluntary actions; we also deepen our longterm commitments towards decarbonising the economy. Our electricity matrix continues to be a global example of planning and use of renewable energies thanks to the long periods of energy generation based solely on renewable sources, for instance water, wind, geothermal, biomass and sunlight.
In addition to the compensation process of our forests, we add the reduction of emissions in critical sectors such as transport, livestock, and waste. We
9

have defined an absolute emission limit by 2030, equivalent to a decrease in emissions of 25% compared to 2012. This places us in a privileged place to become a green centre for management, innovation, and knowledge transfer. We invite our strategic partners to join this effort.
It is clear that we cannot not improve the health of our oceans if we do not change on land production and consumption. In this sense, we recently issued the Polftica Nacional de Saneamiento de Aguas Residuales (National Policy on Wastewater Sanitation) that seeks to stop pollution resulting from land-based activities and reverse its cumulative effects; we also issued the Estrategia Nacional de Sustitucidn de Plsticos (National Strategy for Plastics Replacement) which it is intended to replace the use of straws, coffee and plastic containers. In addition, we work to end destructive fishing practices and articulate efforts for coastal populations to develop from the use and sustainable management of marine-coastal resources.
Also in regards to conservation, we presented the Polftica Nacional de Humedales (National Wetlands Policy), which seeks the ecological rehabilitation of Costa Rican wetland ecosystems and the promotion of actions for their sustainable and participatory use, as well as the establishment of a planned framework in the long term to achieve the restoration of the national wetland systems and ensure a responsible use of them that will contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of communities.
We believe that all these efforts not only favour the attention and mitigation of climate change but also its impact on Human Rights and public policies that promote gender equality, non-discrimination and the enjoyment of the rights of indigenous peoples.
That is why we also welcome the process of preparing the Global Compact for Regular, Safe and Orderly Migration and the Global Compact on
Refugees.
It is remarkable to see here the principle of progressivity of Human Rights, an essential principle which implies the extension of the range of rights granted and from which we cannot step back. But above all, it entails that we are called to provide our inhabitants with more and better guarantees that allow the free and full exercise of each of these rights.
10

Peace and Security
The 20th Century witnessed some of the greatest and most atrocious conflicts that humanity has experienced. The end of World War II marked an even greater threat, one with the potential -now possible- to destroy us as a species. The nuclear arms race was, for much of the second half of the last century, a constant concern that threatened the continuity of the human family.
Costa Rica sees with great concern the events developing in the Korean peninsula. The increase in the warmongering rhetoric in that place of the Asian continent means a serious and real threat to the peace and stability not only of the region, but of the world. Costa Rica looks with amazement at how, almost three decades after the end of the Cold War, ghosts appeared once again aftering being previously banished from our world where it is now more necessary to provide people with medicine than rifles; more schools than military infrastructure; and more projects to provide clear water than main projects to produce weapons of mass destruction.
That is why we strongly and vehemently condemn the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. We will always be supportive of dialogue, active diplomacy, and multilateralism. We call on the parties involved as well as the United Nations Security Council to take an active role in avoiding escalations of tension that could lead to dire consequences and from which there is a risk of non-return. We cannot remain silent or stand idly. We demand that the Security Council acts immediately to contain this situation, as it is its responsibility.
Mr. President,
We see with hope, joy and pride, that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was finally approved in July of this year, a process in which I congratulate the Costa Rican Ambassador Elayne Whyte, who, as president of the conference during the negotiations, led the process with courage and great skill. That effort, together with that of the participating delegations, made a dream come true after more than seven decades.
This Treaty is a strong message that most of United Nations member states do not support, do not accept, and do not consider nuclear weapons as legitimate and that the international community clearly states that nuclear
11

weapons are not only immoral, ethically refoulement, but are henceforth, illegal.
The adoption if this new norm of international law that absolutely prohibits nuclear weapons is therefore established in all circumstances and provides a solid and legally binding framework for the destruction and total elimination of nuclear weapons in a transparent, irreversible, and verifiable manner within specified time frames.
As an unarmed democracy resting its defence on International Law, we are satisfied that in addition to prohibiting the development, production, manufacture, transfer, possession, storage, location, installation, and deployment of nuclear weapons, the Treaty explicitly prohibits the threat of its use, thereby also banning so-called doctrines of nuclear deterrence security.
Many will say that all this effort is meaningless, since none of the nuclear powers had wanted to be part of it. I tell them they are wrong. The desire of the 122 countries that approved the text of the Treaty is the legitimate voice of people who are lovers of peace and of the defense of humanity. Any effort to be on the side of disarmament will never be nonsense. Being on the side of peace will never be a mistake. Costa Rica applauds these 122 countries and all those who will sign the Treaty tomorrow and makes a vehement call for others to join in, so that we can ensure a future for us and for those who will come after us. It is our responsibility to continue to support the creation of peace so that we can build the world we dream
about.
Costa Rica is constantly shocked by the terrorist attacks that unfortunately happen anywhere in the world with uncomfortable consistency. We want once again to express our absolute and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, no matter who commits it, in what place, or for what purposes, as well as the need to bring its perpetrators to justice. The fight against terrorism must be framed in strict observance of international law, including human rights law, international humanitarian law, and international refugee law.
I wish to emphasize the crucial role of International Law as a legitimate mechanism for settling disputes which we, as states, must settle. To this respect, unilateral economic sanctions lack efficiency as ways to punish governments but cause serious injuries to the rights of the peoples to
12

well-being and development, thus, once again I would like to express the opposition of my country to the embargo the United States has imposed against Cuba for 55 years, carrying high human, economic, and social costs for its population.
Sixty nine years ago Costa Rica decided to change weapons and soldiers for notebooks and teachers. 69 years ago Costa Rica decided to believe, strengthen, and promote International Law as the civilized way to resolve their differences with others and today, 69 years later, Costa Rica continues believing in this way.
The original goal of the birth of the United Nations was to avoid the scourge of war for future generations. Since 1945, the world has changed dramatically. The threats, against peace, stability and global security are increasingly diverse and complex; however, there is something that has not changed a bit, and it is the intrinsic and natural impulse to strive inexhaustibly to reach the dignified and supreme universal values based on law and the prevalence of strong, just institutions over brute force. That is the essence of this Institution: to create and sustain peace and the protection of the welfare of citizens of all member states
The Andalusian poet Federico Garcfa Llorca said that ""theatre is the poetry that rises up from the book and becomes human. And on becoming so it speaks and yells, cries and despairs."" Today we have the obligation to rise from the words we have spoken and to make them a reality. Today we must bring hope back to the heart of every inhabitant of this planet, and ensure that this hope is manifested in a dignified life, which is based on the guarantee of fulfilment of their rights and the entirety of their freedom.
Although the struggle for human rights is a long-standing historical enterprise, the planet has never had such high levels of education, peace, and fewer armed conflicts as in our time. This should not become a call to demobilization or complacency, but rather an indication that, despite everything and even when there are regions still dominated by war and structural violence, human society is on the right path, with much gratitude owed to the efforts of this Organization.
We own our future. Despite the pain generated by injustice and irrationality that still prevail in our time, there are more people convinced of goodness, solidarity, freedom, justice, peace, forgiveness and reconciliation, than
13

those who sponsor death, pain, torture, militarization or the predominance of fear over our beautiful capacity to create.
Mr. President,
This will be the last speech I address to this forum as President of Costa Rica. Next year, in fulfilment of a civic ritual that my country has celebrated for many decades, my people will send a new representative to bear his voice in this Organization, of which we feel very proud. As it will be many times in the future, because inevitably, the presidential mandate, when living in democracy, requires the permanent renewal of its leadership.
Thinking on this moment for months, I wish to dedicate these closing words to my daughters and sons on behalf of all delegates and their children. The new generations that we have begotten deserve to be acknowledged in this Universal Forum because in many ways they are the beneficiaries of what their parents solve here, both in a metaphorical sense, and in a deeply human one. I want MOnica, Cristina, Beatriz, Diego, Ignacio, and little In6s to know that every time a father or mother has come to this podium to preach about peace and justice, reconciliation and solidarity, he or she did it thinking about them, in their present and future. I want them to know that every time a father or mother has claimed from this rostrum for Human Rights, for equality between women and men or for the defence of Nature against the irrational forces of human greed or consumerism, he or she has felt responsible for the well-being of their children and the individuals who will inherit the future. And I want them to know also that their parents, and before them other Costa Rican fathers and mothers who have stood before the General Assembly, did it so with the great pride of being representatives of worthy, hardworking and brave people who love freedom, builds peace day to day, and that will always defend Human Rights as the supreme good of our universal family.
That should make them feel proud and happy. Proud of being part of a historical continuum that, like the waves of the sea, will happen again and again while the world has hope and aspirations of human progress, and happy in the certainty that our work in favour of Justice and Peace was not
-nor has it been- in vain.
14

Mr. President, Excellences,
I hope that the United Nations will continue to be the preferred space of understanding among the peoples of the world. Not a conflict-free space, which unfortunately is not the natural condition of our species, but a meeting point and agreement to make a reality the aspirations of human progress that require survival. And I also hope that this session can be conducted within an increasingly luminous framework of demilitarization and denuclearization, the only ways that will make this survival possible beyond all efforts to guarantee it. And I also hope from the bottom of my heart, that all Nations of Earth represented here are happy in peace and capable of asserting the wise biblical admonition of ""beating swords into ploughshares"" which is another way of saying ""love your neighbour as yourself"". Thank you.
15"
Croatia,"Mr. President,
Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me use this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to all those affected by the destruction wrought by hurricanes Irma and Maria as well as to the people of Mexico, who have been hit by successive earth quakes these past few days.
1992-2017
25 years ago, my country's first president, Franjo Tuman, addressed the General Assembly as Croatia was being admitted to the United Nations, bringing us back into the fold of free nations.
At that time, he appealed to the international community to help end the aggression against Croatia and establish lasting peace.
Since then, my country has been rebuilt, modernised and profoundly transformed and has become one of Europe's top tourist destinations.
Today, Croatia is a Member State of the European Union and NATO.
Building on its unique historical circumstances we are now actively participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe and provide development aid to societies in need.
I address you as the Prime Minister of a country which has during this relatively short time served on the Security Council, has presided over the Economic and Social Council and the Peacebuilding Commission, and which is currently a member of the Human Rights Council.
International order
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Today we celebrate the International Day of Peace.
I would like to reiterate that Croatia as a peace-loving nation, as symbolised here in the UN by the recently restored ""Peace monument"" of our great sculptor Antun Augustinci, is a strong advocate of a rules-based international order.
At the national and global level, we believe that institutions need to be more open to the public and genuinely involve people in their decision-making.
It is only through active and informed citizenry that we can make governments accountable and create credible institutions.

Only well-functioning institutions assure implementation of the rule of law.
Such citizens' involvement brings a welcomed mix of representative and participatory democracy, by bringing forward substantiated arguments and avoiding superficial and misleading populism.
Croatia puts great emphasis on peace, justice and strong institutions as one of the seventeen goals to transform our world.
Our own experiences
Building state institutions was a particular challenge for a country which achieved peace and reestablished its territorial integrity only 20 years ago.
Croatia is dedicated to assisting others in post-conflict transition with its own experiences in reconciliation and confidence building.
We were a recipient of international security assistance, including through several UN missions.
One of the most successful peacekeeping missions to date was UNTAES  the UN Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, which ended in January 1998 with the peaceful reintegration of our formerly occupied territories.
We put at disposal this unique know-how and extensive expertise as a useful complementary contribution to the international community's efforts in similar situations, such as with the implementation of the Minsk Agreements in Ukraine, where we can draw many parallels.
Reform of the UN
Mr. President,
Discussing strong international organisations globally means addressing the strength of this august institution  the United Nations  as well.
As the world changes, our firm belief is that the UN must also keep up and change.
Croatia supports the Secretary-General's drive to reform the Secretariat, especially in peacekeeping and development.
Secretary-General's ""surge in diplomacy"" is also a much needed development.
Central to UN reform is reform of the Security Council.
It is vital that its membership  both permanent and non-permanent  is regionally balanced and more reflective of the world seventy years into the organization's life.

In particular, we believe that the path to achieving this goal would be expedited by enlarging both categories of membership  permanent and non-permanent members  including through ensuring that the Eastern European Group is better represented in the Security Council's non-permanent membership.
Migrations
Mr. President,
One of the effects of globalisation is that the world is faced with an unprecedented number of people on the move.
Refugee crises and mass migration are a reality.
One in 30 people around the world are migrants.
Croatia in the past has been faced with acute refugee and migrant crises.
The approach we took has always been  and will always be  one that puts people first.
In the context of the upcoming negotiations on the Global Compact on Migration, we would advocate an approach to human mobility that prioritises safety, dignity and human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, no matter where they come from and where they are headed.
As with all global challenges, here too a holistic approach is required.
We therefore need to work together to fight the root causes of mass migrations  be it poverty, failing States and wars or climate change and natural disasters  while standing against exploitation and abuse in the context of human trafficking and people smuggling.
In the framework of the European Union Croatia is working with its partners on stemming illegal flows of people, especially from the Eastern Mediterranean  Balkan route, while at the same time providing concrete support to countries of origin to address root causes, in particular through its development aid programmes.
Preventive diplomacy and conflicts
Mr. President,
In addressing crises across the globe our focus should be on early-warning, prevention and diplomacy.
Any post-conflict measure comes too late, especially in terms of human life.

Conflicts need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and require tailor made approaches.
While a consistent approach of the UN  and in particular the Security Council  to conflicts is essential for the Organization's credibility, copy-pasted ""one-size-fits-all"" approaches are not the most effective way to proceed.
In understanding the situation and risks on the ground we must in particular draw on the knowledge and experience of local populations, neighbouring countries and regional organizations.
Croatia believes that when addressing conflicts and crises  be it in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen or anywhere else in the world  it is important to have a global comprehensive approach based on solidarity and coordinated international effort under strong UN leadership.
One that would include political, humanitarian, socio-economic, stabilisation and security elements, and where reconstruction goes hand in hand with reconciliation, and building resilience.
Peacekeeping operations
Our contribution to peacekeeping operations will continue to be an important component of our foreign policy, both through direct participation and in terms of sharing our experiences and expertise or know-how.
Croatia has contributed to 19 UN peace-keeping operations to date and we are currently preparing our contribution to UNIFIL in Lebanon.
Like many other countries, apart from UN peacekeeping operations, we also participate in international operations led by other organisations (EU, NATO and OSCE).
Human rights
Human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal values.
We should spare no effort in their promotion and protection.
Any violation of human rights requires an immediate and appropriate response.
We advocate tighter links between the Human Rights Council and the Security Council.
We also acknowledge the importance to the principle of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and take particular pride in the fact that one of Croatia's top diplomats leads the UN's efforts in this respect.

We welcome the establishment of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism because it is evident that there is a real need for strategic coordination and leadership to our global counterterrorism efforts.
It is also necessary that we continue working on preventing and countering radicalisation and violent extremism.
North Korea
Mr. President,
Croatia fully supports recent unanimous Security Council action on North Korea, whose actions represent a direct threat to international peace and security.
We appeal to North-Korean authorities to discontinue developing and testing nuclear weapons and to fully meet their commitments under international law, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and global non-proliferation regime.
International law
Mr. President,
Adherence to the standards, principles and rules of international law and their faithful implementation represent a firm foundation for lasting peace and stability worldwide, to which we are deeply attached. In that regard I would particularly like to recall the principles of good faith and free consent.
We believe that disputes should be resolved through peaceful means and in conformity with international law.
It is of the utmost importance that all international adjudications meet the highest legal standards and fully respect their relevant rules.
Compromising the impartiality or independence of international adjudicators and tribunals, as was the case in the terminated Arbitration Process between Croatia and Slovenia, makes their decisions legally void and left Croatia with no choice other than to withdraw from the arbitration process.
We consider that this example of undermining the rule of law is a discouragement for States considering third-party dispute settlement.
At the same time, we want to solve the open border issue with our neighbouring friend and ally, Slovenia, through bilateral dialogue.

In addition, Croatia strongly supports full and unequivocal implementation of all applicable rules of international humanitarian and criminal law, as well as full investigation and punishment of all atrocities.
South East Europe
Preserving peace and stability in South East Europe is obviously of key importance for my country.
While the world faces many overwhelming challenges, we should bear in mind that regional stability in South East Europe is still to be entrenched.
By transferring our knowledge and promoting the integration of the countries of Southeast Europe to the European Union, and NATO  if they wish so  Croatia actively encourages stability in the region.
We believe in building strong societies in our neighbourhood, aiming to shift away from containing crises towards prevention, political dialogue and active engagement.
This is especially important in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, where proper implementation of the constitutional equality of its three constituent peoples  Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats  is a prerequisite for ensuring the full functionality and stability of the state and its European integration process which we wholeheartedly support.
Development
Mr. President,
Two years ago, through the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the international community properly recognized the limits of reach of individual governments.
Universal challenges indeed demand our joint response.
In addition, cooperation with academia, the business community and civil society is indispensable, but it would be unwise not to also tap the ideas and ingenuity of each individual in our respective societies.
Especially of our youth who is, in the age of modern technology, absorbing knowledge and acquiring skills in a faster and more open manner.
Thus it is our global task to adjust our educational systems to form the future responsible citizens, to give them job opportunities and fit the real needs of our labour markets.

Coming from Croatia, the homeland of Nikola Tesla, the great inventor, I cannot but stress how vitally important it is that the UN facilitates a transformation towards the age of digital economy and narrows the digital divide, which could generate new inequalities.
Eradicating poverty remains our primary development objective, since it is a cause and consequence of conflict, instability and crises.
But it is only by paying equal attention to transformational, cross-cutting elements  such as human rights, equality, good governance, the rule of law and inclusive societies  that we will be able to achieve true sustainable development.
Climate change
As we are witnessing the daily erosion of climate conditions and increasing natural disasters, more is required from humanity.
This burden is ours to bear.
In the recent months, unfortunately, my country was not spared wildfires and floods either, which reached unprecedented dimensions.
These increasingly worrying warnings are a call to action  without delay.
Croatia has already demonstrated its dedication to global efforts to preserve the environment by ratifying the Paris Agreement.
Two days ago I expressed our principled support to the new French initiative  the Global Pact for the Environment  aimed at better coordinating global action against climate change.
In the context of sustainable development, synergies between global, national and local policies need to be strengthened.
We believe that next year's High Level Political Forum will offer a platform to discuss efficient measures for a true transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies, such as the pivotal goal of making cities and human settlements inclusive and safe, while granting their inhabitants a proper quality of life.
Conclusion
Mr. President,
Croatia's commitment to multilateralism is unwavering.

We believe in the UN system and our joint potential to promote effective, inclusive and sustainable global governance, based on the rules and principles of international law.
It is with this aspiration in mind that Croatia joined the United Nations 25 years ago.
A quarter of a century later, I stand before you with the same noble ambitions and responsibility  for the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and economic betterment, for solidarity with humans living in precarious conditions and for common issues concerning our planet.
Only with joint vigour to that end, we can advance and materialize our professed common goals and values.
It is incumbent upon us to do so, and the time is now.
Thank you."
Cuba,"Mr. President:
Mr. Secretary General;
Allow me to reiterate to you Cuba's, support to your work at the helm of the United Nations and as a guarantor and advocate of international peace.
Heads of State and Government;
Distinguished delegates;
I would like to express my deep condolences to the relatives of the deceased and the victims of hurricanes Irma and Maria, as well as our disposition to increase our cooperation, to the extent of our modest possibilities, with the brother peoples and governments of Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda, small Caribbean islands which suffered a terrible devastation; with the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten, Virgin Islands and Anguilla.
I call upon the international community to give the highest priority to this situation
and mobilize resources to assist the small Caribbean Island States and territories which have suffered such devastation.
We would like to convey Cuba's warmest feelings of solidarity to the government and people of Mexico, particularly to the victims and their relatives, who were affected by both earthquakes, and reiterate to them our disposition to assist the population and support the recovery works with our modest efforts.
We also want to express our sorrow to the US people, as well as our heartfelt
condolences to the relatives of the deceased and to all of the victims of hurricane
Irma.

Mr. President:
I want to convey the testimony of the people of Cuba, who are currently carrying out a colossal effort to recover from the severe damages caused by hurricane Irma to housing, agriculture, the power system and other services. Despite the all encompassing preventive measures - which included the evacuation of more than 1.7 million persons- and the full cooperation of all citizens, we suffered the loss of ten persons.
The painful damages to services as well as the loss of social and personal goods as well as the hardships endured by families that spent many hours without electricity or water, contributed to strengthen the unity and solidarity of our noble and heroic people.
The moving scenes of rescuers saving a girl and giving her back to her mother; of a little boy picking up a bust of Jose Marti from the rubble; of students helping families they had not met before; of soldiers from the Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior doing the toughest jobs; of local leaders heading the most
difficult tasks have become all too familiar.
During a visit paid to the area that suffered the most severe devastation. President Raul Castro issued an appeal which literally read, and I quote: ""These have been tough days for our people who, in only a few hours, have seen how what was built with great effort has been destroyed by a devastating hurricane. The images received during the last few hours are too eloquent, just as much as the spirit of resilience and victory of our people that are reborn in the face of every adversity.""
On behalf of the government and the people of Cuba, I sincerely appreciate the genuine expressions of solidarity and affection expressed by numerous governments, parliaments, international organizations and representatives of the civil society.
I would like to convey my profound gratitude for the numerous offers of assistance
that we have received.
Mr. President:
I still keep vivid and emotional memories of the imposing presence of Fidel Castro Ruz, the Commander in Chief of the Cuban Revolution, and the great validity of the ideas he expressed before this Assembly.
On behalf of our people and government, I would like to express our gratitude for the feelings of respect, affection and admiration we have received from all
latitudes.

Mr. President:
On Tuesday last, President Donald Trump came here to convince us that one of his purposes is to promote the prosperity of nations and persons. But, in the real world, the wealth owned by eight men altogether is equivalent to the wealth shared by 3.6 billion human beings, who make up the poorest half of humanity.
In terms of turnover, 69 of the 100 biggest entities of the world are transnationals, not States. The turnover of the world's ten biggest corporations is higher than the public revenues earned by 180 countries combined.
Seven hundred million persons live in extreme poverty; 21 million are victims of forced labor. In 2015, 5.9 million children died of preventable or curable diseases before reaching the age of 5. A total of 758 million adults are illiterate.
Eight hundred and fifteen million persons suffer from chronic hunger -tens of millions more than in 2015. Two billion are undernourished. Even if the precarious decreasing growth rate of recent years rebounds, 653 million persons will continue to face hunger by the year 2030, and this will not be enough to eradicate hunger by the year 2050.
There are 22.5 million refugees. Humanitarian tragedies associated to migrants flows worsen and increase amidst a clearly unjust international economic and political order.
The construction of walls and barriers as well as the laws and measures adopted to prevent the waves of refugees and migrants have proved to be cruel and ineffective. There is a proliferation of exclusive and xenophobic policies that violate the human rights of millions of persons and fail to solve the problems of underdevelopment, poverty and armed conflicts, which are the main causes of migration and refugee claims.
Military expenditures have increased to 1.7 trillion dollars. That reality belies those who claim that there are not enough resources to eradicate poverty.
However, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development lacks the means for its implementation, due to the egoism and lack of political will of the United States and
other industrialized countries.
What is the miraculous recipe that President Donald Trump recommends to us in
the absence of the financial flows of the Marshall Plan? Who will contribute the resources for that? How can this be reconciled with the ""America First"" idea
advanced by Presidents Reagan and Trump?

President Trump ignores and distorts history and portraits a chimera as a goal to be pursued. The production and consumption patterns proper of neoliberal capitalism are unsustainable and irrational and will inexorably lead to the destruction of the environment and the end of the human species.
Can anyone forget about the consequences of colonialism, slavery, neocolonialism and imperialism?
Could the several decades of bloody military dictatorships in Latin America be referred to as an example of a successful capitalism?
Does anyone know of any recipe of neoliberal capitalism that has been better applied than those which destroyed the Latin American economies in the 1980s?
It is both indispensable and urgent for the United Nations to work in order to establish a new participatory, democratic, equitable and inclusive international
economic order, as well as a new financial architecture that take into account the
needs and peculiarities of developing countries and the asymmetries that exist in world trade and finances as a result of centuries of exploitation and plundering.
Industrialized countries have the moral duty, the historical responsibility as well as sufficient financial and technological means for that.
Not even the rich will enjoy the announced prosperity if climate change is not stopped.
Cuba regrets the decision taken by the government of the United States, which has been historically the principal greenhouse gas emitting government in the planet, to withdraw its country from the Paris Agreement.
In 2016, and for the third consecutive year, the average global temperature increase records have been broken, which confirms that climate change is a threat to the survival of humanity and the sustainable development of our peoples.
We reiterate our solidarity with the Small Island Developing States, particularly from the Caribbean and the Pacific, which are the most affected by climate change and for which we claim a just, special and differentiated treatment.
Mr. President:
The US government has come here to tell us that, in addition to prosperity, the other two ""beautiful pillars"" of international order are sovereignty and security.

We all share the common responsibility to preserve the existence of human beings in the face of a nuclear threat. An important contribution to the achievement of that goal was the historical adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons under the auspices of the United Nations, which proscribe the use and the threat of use of those weapons that have the capacity to annihilate the human species.
Obviously, the United States strongly opposed this treaty. It announced that it will invest 700 billion dollars in military expenditures and is developing an extremely aggressive nuclear and military doctrine based on the threat to use and the use of
force.
NATO member States attempt against international peace and security and International Law by promoting military interventions and non-conventional wars against sovereign States.
As was pointed out by the Commander in Chief of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz: ""Let the philosophy of plunder disappear and the philosophy of war will also disappear!""
The illegal imposition of unilateral coercive measures and the use of financial, legal, cultural and communicational instruments to destabilize governments as well as the denial of peoples' right to self-determination have become customary.
The covert use of ICTs to attack other States increases, while several developed countries strongly oppose the adoption of international treaties that would regulate cooperation in order to achieve a safe cyberspace.
The US President manipulates the concepts of sovereignty and security to his exclusive benefit and to the detriment of all others, including his allies.
The attempt to resort to military threats and force to stop the irreversible world trend to multi-polarization and polycentrism will seriously jeopardize international peace and security, which should be defended and preserved through international
mobilization.
The principles of sovereign equality, respect for the territorial integrity and non
interference in the internal affairs of States should be observed. The UN Charter
and International Law admit no re-interpretation.
The United Nations reform should pursue the principal goal of responding to the pressing needs of peoples and the great disadvantaged majorities. Multilateralism should be protected and reinforced in the face of the imperialist interests of domination and hegemony.

The democratization of the Security Council, both in terms of its composition and its working methods, is a most urgent task.
The strengthening of the General Assembly and the recovery of the functions that have been usurped from it are indispensable.
Mr. President:
The ""patriotism"" invoked in the US statement is a perversion of humanism, the love and loyalty to the homeland and of the enrichment and defense of national and universal culture. It embodies an exceptionalist and supremacist vision of ignorant intolerance in the face of diverse political, economic, social and cultural models.
In developed countries, the loss of legitimacy of political systems and parties worsens and electoral abstentionism is on the rise. Corruption, whether legal or illegal, has turned into metastasis. So is the extreme case of the so called ""special interests"" or corporate payments in exchange for benefits in the country that spends the highest amount of money in electoral campaigns and where, paradoxically, a candidate with the lowest number of popular votes can be elected or entitled to govern with a negligible support by voters.
There has been and increasing and unheard-of use of science and technology to exercise hegemony, mutilate national cultures and manipulate human behavior, as is the case of the so called ""big data"" or psychometry, used for political and advertising purposes. Seven consortia keep a strict control of whatever is read, watched or heard in the planet. Technologies are being monopolized. The governance of digital networks is dictatorial and discriminatory and, despite appearances, the digital divide between rich and poor countries is increasing.
The opportunities and rights of youths, migrants and workers are curtailed and their human rights are openly and systematically violated.
The day before yesterday, the US Vice-president, Michael Pence, ridiculously ignoring the functions of the Security Council and attempting to establish new prerogatives, said that this organ should modify the composition and methods of the UN Human Rights Council, which ""doesn't deserve its name"" because ""a clear majority of the Human Rights Council members fail to meet even the most basic human rights standards"". I suppose he is not including, in this case, his own country, which will in fact deserve to be included because of its pattern of systematic violations of human rights, namely the use of torture, arbitrary detentions and imprisonment -as occurs at the Guantanamo Naval Base-, the assassination of African Americans by law enforcement agents, the killing of innocent civilians perpetrated by its troops and the xenophobia and repression against immigrants -including minors- as well as its scarce adherence to
international instruments.

Mr. President:
We reaffirm our strongest condemnation against all forms and manifestations of terrorism and reject the double standards in combatting them.
The urgent search for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East is based on the exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-
determination and the existence of a free and independent State within the pre1967 borders, with Eastern Jerusalem as its capital.
The situation in Western Sahara requires an effort in conformity with the UN resolutions to guarantee the Saharan people's exercise to self-determination and respect for their legitimate right to live in peace in their own territory.
Cuba reaffirms its support to the search for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the war in Syria without any foreign interference and with full respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The threats to international peace and security resulting from the expansion of NATO's presence along the Russian borders are on the increase. We continue to reject the unilateral and unjust sanctions imposed against that country.
We demand respect for the so called Nuclear Agreement signed with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
We reject the threat to totally destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the home to 25 million human beings. War is not an option in the Korean peninsula; it would threaten the existence of hundreds of millions of persons in this area as well as in neighboring countries; it would lead to a nuclear war of unpredictable consequences. Only through dialogue and negotiation would it be possible to achieve a lasting political solution that should take into account the legitimate concerns of all the parties involved. We support the total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, without any foreign interference, with absolute respect for sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and strictly abiding by the principle of not using or threatening to use force.
Mr. President:
New threats are hovering over peace and stability in Latin America and the Caribbean, in open disrespect for the ""Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace"" signed in Havana by the Heads of State and Government of our region in January, 2014, on the occasion of the Second Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).
We reiterate what was expressed by President Raul Castro Ruz about the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on July 14 last:

""The aggression and putschist violence against Venezuela harms all of Our America and only serve the interests of those set on dividing us to exercise their control over our peoples, unconcerned about causing conflicts of incalculable consequences in this region, like those we are seeing in different parts of the
world.
""Today we warn that those attempting to overthrow the Bolivarian and Chavista Revolution through unconstitutional, violent and putschist methods will shoulder a serious responsibility before history
We strongly reject the military threats against Venezuela, the Executive Order that designates it as a threat to the national security of the United States and the unilateral, unjust and arbitrary sanctions applied against it.
We reiterate our unwavering solidarity with the Bolivarian and Chavista government and people and its civic-military union led by the constitutional
President Nicolas Maduro Moros.
We denounce and condemn the NICA Act Initiative, promoted in the US Congress as part of an interventionist behavior which is intended to impose an economic blockade against the people and the government of Nicaragua, to whom we reiterate our support.
We express our solidarity with former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, victim of a political persecution intended to prevent him from running for direct elections by means of a judicial disqualification. Lula, President Dilma Rousseff, the Workers* Party and the Brazilian people will always find Cuba on their side.
We reiterate our historical commitment with the free determination and
independence of the Puerto Rican people.
We support the legitimate claim of Argentina for the sovereignty over the Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands.
Cuba will continue to contribute, to the extent possible, and at the request of the parties involved, its efforts to achieve a stable and lasting peace in Colombia.
We will uphold our commitment to share our modest achievements with the peoples of the South, including the efforts of the 41 652 cooperation workers deployed in 63 countries to struggle for the life and health of human beings.

Mr. President:
On June 16 last, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, announced the new Cuba policy of his administration, which is a setback in US-Cuba bilateral relations and undermines the bases established two years ago to advance towards a new type of relation between our countries, characterized by respect and equality.
The US Government has decided to tighten the economic, commercial and financial blockade by imposing new obstacles to the already limited possibilities its business community had to trade with and invest in Cuba as well as additional restrictions on US citizens willing to travel to our country.
Those decisions ignore the support from broad sectors in the US, including the majority of Cuban emigres, to the lifting of the blockade and the normalization of relations. They only serve the interests of a group of Cuban origin, based in South Florida, which is an ever more isolated and minoritarian group that insists in harming Cuba and its people for having decided to defend, at all costs, the right to be free, independent and sovereign.
Today we reiterate our condemnation of the measures aimed at tightening the blockade and reaffirm that any strategy intended to destroy the Revolution will fail.
Likewise, we reject the manipulation of the human rights issue against Cuba, which has a lot to be proud of and has no need to receive lessons from the United States
or anyone.
This time we would like to express our strongest condemnation of the disrespectful, offensive and interventionist statement against Cuba and the Cuban government, made three days ago at this rostrum by President Donald Trump. We remind him that the United States, where flagrant human rights violations are committed, which raise deep concern among the international community, has no moral authority to judge my country. We reaffirm that Cuba will never accept any preconditions or impositions, nor will it ever renounce any of its principles.
Regarding the alleged incidents that would have affected US diplomatic officials in Havana we categorically affirm that the Cuban government rigorously and seriously abides by its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations in relation to the protection and the integrity of all diplomats without any exception, including those from the United States. Cuba has never perpetrated nor will it ever perpetrate actions of this sort. Cuba has never allowed nor will it ever allow its territory to be used by third parties with that purpose.

The Cuban authorities, based on the preliminary results of the priority investigation that is being carried out with a high technical component, following instructions from the top level of our government, has taken into account the data contributed by the US authorities and so far has found no evidence whatsoever that could confirm the causes or the origin of the health disorders referred to by US diplomats and their relatives. The investigation to clarify this issue continues, and in order to be able to arrive to a conclusion, it will be crucial to count on the cooperation of the US authorities. It would be unfortunate if a matter of this nature is politicized. As was expressed by the Cuban President Raul Castro Ruz, Cuba is willing to continue negotiating all pending bilateral issues with the United States, on the basis of equality and absolute respect for the sovereignty and independence of our country; and maintaining a respectful dialogue and cooperation in areas of common interest with the US government. Cuba and the United States can cooperate and coexist, respecting their differences and promoting everything that benefits both countries and peoples, but no one should expect Cuba to make concessions that affect its sovereignty and independence.
Mr. President:
The Cuban people will not cease in their legitimate claim for the lifting and total elimination of the economic, commercial and financial blockade and will continue to denounce the strengthening of that policy. On November Cuba will once again present to the United Nations General Assembly the draft Resolution entitled ""Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America against Cuba."" While inequality, the opulence of a few and the marginalization of many are growing in today's world, the Cuban people will keep up its struggle to achieve the most just society possible. We will continue to steadily advance down the path of revolutionary transformations that has been sovereignly chosen by all Cubans to further improve our socialism.
Thank you, very much.

Cyprus,"Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the outset, I wish to convey my Government's congratulations to Mr. Miroslav Laj.bk (^,TaK) on his election as President of the General Assembly for its 72nd Session and assure of our unwavering support on his mission.
At the same time, I congratulate, once again, the Secretary - General, Mr. Antbnio Guterres, on the assumption of his duties since January 1st 2017. The government of Cyprus and I personally have full faith and confidence in his abilities and vision.
To this end, we stand ready to provide any assistance deemed necessary towards the shared goal of promoting the values and principles of the UN in a period of great uncertainty and instability.
Your Excellencies,
2017 has been another turbulent year. To name a few; terrorism, regional conflicts, forced migration, the alarming effects of climate change and humanitarian crises are realities which have placed enormous strain on our people and the environment.
Human nature drives us to aim for the best, for us and the generations to follow: for the preservation of our planet; for a peaceful resolution to conflicts; for an end to terrorism and extremism; for actions to prevent natural disasters; for joint efforts to alleviate the immeasurable human suffering experienced around the world.
There is only one way to achieve this: Multilateralism. We stand here, as world leaders, to pledge our determination and commitment to a better world, through cooperation and joint actions.
It is only through collective efforts that we can address crises like the current one with North Korea, which threatens the resilience of our global non-proliferation and disarmament regimes, as well as the peace and security architecture of the region and beyond.
International, multilateral cooperation is also vital in dealing with the scourge of terrorism. Terrorist attacks have unfortunately become commonplace in our world, from Baghdad to

Kabul, from Paris to Cairo, from Barcelona to London, where our cities and citizens have become the targets of cowardly acts of asymmetric aggression.
Parallel to adopting enhanced security measures, it is essential to prevent and to counter radicalization and violent extremism within our societies, through education, dialogue, economic growth and social inclusion.
Your Excellencies, Mr. President,
There is no security without development; and there is no development without security. Enhancing the resilience of our societies is a key aspect of our multilateral endeavors and in this respect our determination to implement the 2030 Agenda must remain high on our list of priorities, Sustainable development is at the heart of dealing with the root causes of forced migration which has, for the last two years, dominated the global agenda and not unjustly.
This crisis is putting pressure not only on our governments but also on our societies, while at the same time changing the way political dialogue is carried out. However overwhelming the situation is, we must not lose sight of the big picture, which is none other than the need for solidarity and burden sharing.
Mr. President,
All the above, and even more challenges we face, point to one direction: we need a just, effective, and efficient global governance system.
In this respect, we are here to renew our commitment to a global order based on international law, with the principles of the UN Charter at its core; a global order which ensures that peace, security, human rights and sustainable development remain the highest values which we undertake to preserve and uphold.
Cyprus believes that the reform priorities that the Secretary General has set are essential in ensuring that multilateralism, at a time of growing skepticism and isolationist tendencies, remains relevant and effective.
The three pillars of reform, in distinct yet parallel and complementary processes will, if successful, provide us with a changed narrative as to the ability to prevent crises before they erupt; reinforcing and enhancing peace-keeping and peace - building, humanitarian assistance and long-term development and growth.
Mr. President,
The theme of this year's General Assembly,"" Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"", is extremely pertinent for my country which still suffers from the scourges of war and its ongoing violent division.
2

In this regard, it is our strong opinion that the most vital pillar to achieving inter-state, regional and global peace is through respecting and ensuring the full and unhindered independency, territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every member-state of the United Nations.
A pillar which constitutes one of the most indispensable provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the most basic rule towards prohibiting foreign interventions to the territory, the exclusive economic zone or the internal affairs of an independent and sovereign member-state of the UN.
It is only through abiding by this norm that we can avoid inter-state conflicts or bloody internal clashes which in turn establish the conditions for protracted destabilization, violence and uncertainty.
One of the countries which unfortunately still endures the consequences of the blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the UN is my country, the Republic of Cyprus, which since the 1974 military invasion of Turkey still remains under its occupation.
The pretext for the invasion was the restoration of the constitutional order, following the attempt for a coup d'tat against the President of the Republic by the Greek military Junta.
i deliberately referred to a pretext, since, instead of restoring the constitutional order, Turkey occupied 37% of the territory of Cyprus, forcibly displacing from their ancestral homeland more than a third of the Greek Cypriot community, with thousands murdered, while since 1974 more than a thousand Greek Cypriots are still missing.
With the same use of force, all our Turkish Cypriot compatriots were compelled by Turkey to relocate from the areas controlled by the Government of Cyprus in which they used to reside peacefully, to the areas occupied by Turkey.
in the same context and via the continuous presence of over forty thousand Turkish troops and thousands of implanted settlers in a conscious effort to alter the demographic character of the island, Turkey established an illegal entity which is under its absolute political, economic, cultural and religious control and dominance.
Mr. President, Your Excellencies,
it is not my aim to engage in a blame-game. On the contrary, I truly wish I could be in a position to inform that my vision to reaching a settlement, as I have repeatedly conveyed from this podium, had materialised.

Unfortunately, despite our constructive stance, our tireless and unwavering efforts and the progress achieved, this new round of talks which was launched in May 2015 and climaxed in July 2017 at Crans Montana, has reached a deadlock.
A deadlock which is attributed exclusively to the intransigent stance of Turkey which, instead of being positively predisposed to establishing a truly independent, sovereign and normal state, through its proposals aimed at reducing Cyprus to a Turkish protectorate.
The above-mentioned would be considered as an exaggeration if I failed to substantiate my reference as I will now immediately proceed to do so.
Mr. President, Your Excellencies,
In 1960, with the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, amongst others, under the Treaty of Guarantee Turkey, Great Britain and Greece undertook to guarantee the independence, territorial integrity and security of Cyprus.
In this regard, allow me to stress that the exploitation of the said provision by Turkey has regrettably ied to the pain and sufferings that the people of Cyprus, Greek and Turkish Cypriots, have and are still enduring; consequence of the unacceptabie status quo.
It is for this exact reason that since resuming negotiations and in order to establish a normal and sovereign State, from the very beginning we set the goal of terminating the Treaty of Guarantee and the rightof intervention, as well as agreeing to a sunset clause for the full withdrawal of foreign troops.
A principled-position which the UN Secretary - General himself also shared as an indispensable element in the efforts to reaching a settlement, as per his statement on June 04, 2017, and I quote: ""Progress in this chapter - meaning the Chapter of Security and Guarantees - is an essential element in reaching an overall agreement and in building trust between the two communities in relation to their future security"".
On the basis both of the observed progress in the bi-communal dialogue and the aforesaid eviluation of the UN Secretary - General, on June 28, 2017 the multilateral Conference on Cyprus commenced with great expectations.
During the negotiations which followed, the UN Secretary - General, in an effort to positively support the whole process, presented an outline of six fundamental thematic topics which consisted on the one hand theChapter of Security and Guarantees, including the withdrawal of foreign troops, and on the other hand issues related with the internal aspects of the Cyprus Problem.

Achieving convergences on the UN Secretary - General's framework would have led to reaching a strategic agreement, thus, injecting a new dynamic impetus in the process with valid hopes that an overall settlement was feasible.

Acting in full conformity with the outline of the UN Secretary - General, ! submitted credible and realistic proposals which effectively addressed the sensitivities and concerns of both communities.

Proposals taking into consideration, based, as also the framework of the UN SecretaryGeneral did, in the capacity of the Republic of Cyprus as a member - state of the EU and the UN.

In stark contradiction to the framework of the UN Secretary - General and the positions of

the other two guarantor powers, Turkey, adopting an inflexible stance, insisted on the

following:

-

Maintaining the Treaty of Guarantee and the right of intervention, as well as a

permanent presence of troops.

Mr= President, Your Excellencies,

During his speech at the General Assembly, the President of Turkey, Mr. Tayip Erdogan, claimed that the unsuccessful outcome of negotiations at Crans Montana was attributable to the incomprehensible position of the Greek Cypriot side.

In response, I would like to ask the Turkish President:

(a)

Is it incomprehensible to aspire to establish an independent and sovereign

State, without any foreign guarantees, any right of intervention by a third country and free

from the presence of occupation troops?

(b) Is it irrational to advocate establishing a normal State in which all decisions will be taken only by its citizens, free from foreign dependencies?

(c)

Is it unreasonable for an EU member-state to efficiently and effectively

participate in the decision-making of the Union?

(d) Is it unfounded to envision terminating the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee and establishing a robust system of security, based on the Charter of the UN and the Treaties of the EU and theCouncil of Europe?

(e)

Is it against any established principle for the UN, as well as the relevant

institutions of the EU, to ensure and safeguard the smooth and secure implementation of

the provisions of the settlement?

(f)

Concurrently, is it a paradox to reject Turkey's insistence that it should assume

the said role?

(g) Does any constitution of a Federal State provide that for every decision at a Federal level, at least one positive vote by the members of the state is required? When especially one of the members of the Federation is controlled by a third country?

(h) Finally, could anyone uphold that reaching a settlement based on the proposals of Turkey would have led to establishing a functional and viable State?
Mr. President, Your Excellencies,
Despite our disappointment, what I wish to emphatically stress and convey is that the vision of the people of Cyprus is none other than ending the unacceptable status quo and establishing a federal state which would ensure to the generations of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, conditions of stability for a safe, prosperous and peaceful future.
A State free from any foreign interventions and dependencies; ""a normal state"", as the UN Secretary - General very correctly stated. A State led by Cypriots for Cypriots.
In this regard and contrary to the statements by Turkish officials, it is my intention during tomorrow's meeting with the UN Secretary - General to convey our readiness to immediately resume negotiations, in accordance with his framework and always in line with the relevant UN Resolutions.
Within this context, it is widely acknowledged that for a new Conference on Cyprus to reconvene and in order to avoid a repetition of shortcomings of the past, there should be thorough and solid preparation and strong political will and determination by all interested parties and stakeholders, so as to ensure that this time deliberations will lead to a positive
outcome.
And in this effort, I have no doubt that the UN Secretary- General and the UN Permanent Members of the Security Council will offer us their support and help.

In parallel, at this critical juncture, instead of unilateral actions which negatively affect the aim of moving the process forward, mutually agreed Confidence Building Measures which are in line with the UN Security - Council Resolutions and the UN Secretary - General reports, such as the return and resettlement of Varosha to its rightful and lawful inhabitants, would be a game changer in creating a climate conducive to resuming negotiations with the aim of reaching a comprehensive settlement.
An aim which would be further reinforced through progress to the humanitarian issue of the missing persons. To this end, I call on Turkey to fully co-operate in order to resolve this

tragic issue. With this opportunity, I also urge all countries which might hold information to open their archives in order to support our efforts to giving an end to this tragic aspect of the Cyprus Problem.
Mr. President, Your Excellencies,
In concluding, ! yet again urge Turkey and our Turkish Cypriot compatriots to realize that it is only through mutual respect and compromises and not obsolete fixations to failed practices that we will achieve a viable and lasting settlement. A settlement which should leave neither winners nor losers and fully respect and address the sensitivities and concerns of both communities.
This is the only way for Cyprus to fully utilize its potential and exploit its unique geographical position.
This is my vision.
Thank You for your attention."
Czech_Republic,"President of the Czech Republic
Speech at the 72nd session
of UN General Assembly
19 September 2017
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
When I was a relatively young man, I was deeply influenced by two books. One of them was ""The End of History"" by Francis Fukuyama and the second one, ""The Clash Civilizations"" by Samuel Huntington. Fukuyama was something like a description of a brave new world, the new Utopia, expecting that every country has the same political system which is based on liberal parliamentary democracy. A nice dream but nothing more than a dream. As for Huntington, he was realistic, he was cynical, he simply predicted gradual conflicts of various types of civilizations. By the way, in one of his articles in Foreign Affairs he speaks also about bloody waters of Islam.
So, now we have a new type of civilization. I should call it the anti-civilization which has emerged during the last two or three decades. The typical feature of this civilization is the fact that it is based on terror and nothing more than terror. And we see these terrorist actions all over Europe and not only Europe; we convey condolences; we express our solidarity with the victims of terrorist actions; we organize protests and demonstrations, but unfortunately, we still hesitate to fight with the terrorist anti-civilization with our full power. And I must admit that one year ago, I criticized here that the United Nations is not able to define the world terrorism. The situation has changed. It has been seventy years in which it has not been able to define the world terrorism, but on the other hand I highly appreciate the action of the Secretary-General and the creation of a new office, the Counter-terrorism Office, and I understand it as a reasonable step towards the practical solution of the fight against the world terrorism. You must know that under the umbrella of the United Nations, there are 38, I repeat, 38 anti-terrorism organizations or institutions. Good heavens, 38! I think that the higher the number of those institutions is, the more the terrorist movement is flourishing and what we need is the single but strong office fighting against terrorism and equipped with all necessary measures including the military force, well, on the base of Article 47 of the Charter of the United Nations. And I appreciate also the nomination of Mr. Voronkov. I met him yesterday and I am sure he will be able to solve the problems, which is necessary to fight the world Islamic terrorism.
Well, let me tackle the second side of the coin  migration. Migration is partially

provoked by terrorist actions, for instance in Syria or in Iraq. But on the other hand, migration is connected to terrorism because some jihadists are hidden inside the migration wave. And in Europe and everywhere, they create sleeping units, lonely wolves and so on. Well, I understand the people who say that we must welcome the migrants. But my opposition starts from the fact that the massive migration from African and other countries represents a brain drain. The young, healthy people, mainly men, who leave their countries, represent the weakening of the potential of those countries and everybody who welcomes migrants in Europe agrees to the brain drain and with permanent backwardness of those countries. What we need is to help those countries with electricity, hospitals, schools, water resources and so on to stabilize the population in those countries, but not to support the migration.
Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude I would like to say that the fight, the war against terrorism is to be based on historical optimism, on the belief that we shall overcome it - some day. In Barcelona, Spanish people said: ""We are not afraid!"" And Franklin Roosevelt sometimes proclaimed freedom from fear. That is why I would like to quote the most beautiful sentence expressing the historical optimism - this sentence by Martin Luther: ""If I knew there would be a doomsday tomorrow I shall go today and I shall plant an apple tree.""
Thank you so much for your attention."
Democratic_People's_Republic_of_Korea,"Mr. President,
First of all, allow me to congratulate Your Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajcak on your election as the President of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
I look forward to successful outcome of the present session under your able guidance.
Before going into the main points in my debate, I feel forced to make comments on the speech uttered 4 days ago by someone called the U.S. president that rendered this
sacred UN arena tainted.
Since Trump uttered such reckless and violent words provoking the supreme dignity of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at this very platform, I think it is fair enough for me to make a response in the corresponding tone.
During his 8 months in power, he has turned the White House into a noisy marketing place full of crackling sounds of abacus beads and now he has tried to turn the UN arena into a gangsters' nest where money is respected and bloodshed is the order of the day.
The absurd reality that the person like Trump, a mentally deranged person full of megalomania and complacency, the person who is chastised even by American people as ""Commander in Grief, ""Lyin King"", ""President Evil"" is holding the seat of the U.S. President, and the dangerous reality that the gambler who grew old using threats, frauds and all other schemes to acquire a patch of land holds the nuclear button; these are what constitute the gravest threat to the international peace and security today.
1

Due to his lacking of basic common knowledge and proper sentiment, he tried to insult the supreme dignity of my country by referring it to a rocket. By doing so, however, he committed an irreversible mistake of making our rockets' visit to the entire U.S.
mainland inevitable all the more.
None other than Trump himself is on a suicide mission.
In case innocent lives of the U.S. are lost because of this suicide attack. Trump will be held totally responsible.
The respected supreme leader Comrade Kim Jong Un stated : as a man representing the DPRX and on behalf of the dignity and honor of my state and people and on my own, I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the U.S. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the DPRK.
Trump might not have been aware what is uttered from his mouth but we will make sure that he bears consequences far beyond his words, far beyond the scope of what he can handle even if he is ready to do so.
Mr. President,
Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet;
this is the theme of the current session.
For all countries and people to enjoy peace and a decent life, it is imperative to realize genuine international justice before anything else.
Realizing international justice is one of the main missions of the United Nations.
Mr. President,
Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations stipulates ""to bring about by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace"".
Due to high-handedness and arbitrariness of one particular big power however, at present the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and other established basic principles of international relations are now wantonly ignored in the UN arena.
Abnormal acts of justifying and legitimizing high-handedness and arbitrariness and the acts of violating truth and justice are connived at or tolerated.
The most rampant violation of international justice can be seen on the Korean peninsula.

Unprecedented acts of injustice such as imposing harsh sanctions on a victim for the
reason that the victim chose to stand up to the offender are openly committed in the
name of the UN.
The essence of the situation of the Korean peninsula is a confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S. where the former tries to defend its national dignity and
sovereignty against the latter's hostile policy and nuclear threats.
The United States is the country that first produced nuclear weapons and the only country that actually used it, massacring hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians.
It is the U.S. that threatened to use nuclear weapon against the DPRK during the Korean War in 1950s and first introduced nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula
after the war.
The U.S. started large-scale joint military exercises against the DPRK during the Cold War period and further increased their scope and aggressive nature after the Cold War, staging the exercises several times a year by mobilizing more of nuclear strategic
assets.
What else could be a bigger threat than the violent remarks such as pouring ""fire and fury"", ""total destruction"" coming from the top authority of the world's biggest nuclear
power.
The very reason the DPRK had to possess nuclear weapons is because of the U.S. and it had to strengthen and develop its nuclear force onto the current level to cope with the
U.S.
The U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threats have continued over 70 years and these have led the situation on the Korean peninsula to a touch-and-go point. But in the United Nations, unjustifiable resolutions which illegalize justice as injustice are randomly adopted due to the high-handedness of the U.S.
The respected Supreme Leader Comrade Kim Jong Un, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK said: International justice is never achieved by itself; it can only be achieved when the anti-imperialist independent countries are strong enough.
Unless true international justice is realized, the only valid philosophical principle is that force must be dealt with force and nuclear weapons of tyranny must be dealt with nuclear hammer ofjustice.
The possession of nuclear deterrence by the DPRK is a righteous self-defensive measure taken as an ultimate option, pursuant to this principle.
Recently, the DPRK has successfully conducted ICBM-mountable H-bomb test as a part of the efforts to achieve the goal of completing the state nuclear force.
3

With this, the DPRK has entered a phase of completing the state nuclear force in accordance with its line of simultaneous development of the economy and the nuclear
force.
Our national nuclear force is, to all intents and purposes, a war deterrent for putting an end to nuclear threat of the U.S. and for preventing its military invasion; and our ultimate goal is to establish the balance of power with the U.S.
Distinguished delegates of all countries attending this session are aware of the fact that the DPRK, unlike other nuclear weapon states, made public every time to the world the test process and its result in all stages of the development and advancement of its
nuclear force.
Since the war deterrent for safeguarding peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region is strengthened enough, the United States and its followers must now think twice before launching military provocation against the DPRK.
Although they talk about ""fire and fury"", ""total destruction"" and whatever, every time they have to add various conditions such as ""hopefully this will not be necessary"", ""that is not our first option"" and so on.
Accordingly, we are convinced that peace and security of the northeast Asia and the region as a whole have been as much consolidated.
We do not need anyone's recognition of our status as a nuclear weapon state and our capability of nuclear strike.
The ICBM marked with sacred name of the DPRK flew over the universe above the
endless blue sky, the warhead of our rocket left its trace on the blue waves of the Pacific Ocean and the tremendous explosion and vibration of the hydrogen bomb were recorded by this planet.
Although our decision to possess nuclear weapons was an inevitable option forced by the United States, it resulted in our country achieving the status of a nuclear weapon state and a rocket power, and this prestige has now become an immortal destiny of the
DPRK.
Mr. President,
The failure of the United Nations in fulfilling its role in realizing genuine international justice is primarily related to the undemocratic old practices of the Security Council.
It is none other than the Security Council which disregards the UN Charter from the very first Article and only acts in pursuit of the will and interest of its permanent
member states.

It is not incidental that the issue on reform of the Security Council had already been
decided in 1992 by resolution 47/62 at the 47th Session of UNGA.
Since then, the UNSC reform issue has been discussed at UNGA every year during the past 25 years but without any progress at all. This fact itself clearly shows how deeply the current permanent members are obsessed in their anachronistic vested interests.
One permanent member alone can veto the general will of over 190 UN member states.
Such an undemocratic UN organ is the Security Council.
At this forum, 1 would like to once again remind all the distinguished delegates of the unjust and unfair nature of the ""resolutions"" adopted by the Security Council against
the DPRK.
First, the Security Council fabricated illegal and double-standard ""resolutions"" which only prohibit the satellite launch of the DPRK in violation of the international law prescribing peaceful use of outer space as a sovereign right of every state and without taking any issue with all other satellite launching countries.
Second, the Security Council cooked up illegal and double-standard ""resolutions"" which arbitrarily prohibit only the nuclear tests of the DPRK, although nuclear test strictly belongs to the sovereignty of every state since the international law on prohibition of nuclear test has not yet entered into force and there are countries that
conducted many more nuclear tests.
Third, the Security Council condemned the development of nuclear weapons by the DPRK as a ""threat to international peace and security"" and, on that basis, fabricated illegal and double-standard ""resolutions"" in contravention of Article 51 of the UN Charter which recognizes the right to self-defense of every state and without calling into question the other countries that keep on developing latest nuclear weapons of
various kinds.
The reason these unjust and unfair resolutions continue to be adopted is that the permanent members of the Security Council, all nuclear powers, have common interest in maintaining their monopolistic nuclear status.
The permanent members of UNSC are talking much about non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Viewed from the aspect of nuclear non-proliferation, the DPRK's possession of nuclear weapons is a righteous self-defensive measure.
Actually, the international agreement on nuclear non-proliferation was possible because the nuclear weapon states had made the promise not to threaten non-nuclear weapon states with the nuclear weapons.

Article 10 of NPT stipulates that each Party shall have the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it decides that its supreme interests have been jeopardized. This Article recognizes that supreme interests of states are above the nuclear non-proliferation.
After all, the U.S. itself impeded the international efforts for nuclear non-proliferation by not giving up the nuclear threat against the DPRK, but rather compelling the latter to possess nuclear weapons.
This eloquently shows that the anti-DPRK ""resolutions"" are not based on any established principles and that they are nothing less than the products of undemocratic old practice of the Security Council and the conspiracy and collusion of the forces obsessed only in their vested interests.
The U.S. claims that the DPRK's possession of H-bomb and ICBM constitutes a ""global threat"" even at the UN arena. But such claim is a big lie which is just tantamount to the notorious ""big lie"" faked up by the U.S. in 2003 about the existence in Iraq of weapons of mass destruction in order to invade that country.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a responsible nuclear weapon state.
We will take preventive measures by merciless preemptive action in case the U.S. and its vassal forces show any sign of conducting a kind of ""decapitating"" operation on our headquarters or military attack against our country. However, we do not have any intention at all to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the countries that do not join in the U.S. military actions against the DPRK.
The U.S. is resorting to an intrigue of condemning the DPRK's nuclear possession as ""a global threat"" in order to find a pretext for coercing other UN member states into implementing the anti-DPRK ""sanctions resolutions"".
This is a sneaky and selfish attempt by the U.S. to avoid its responsibility for the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and to pursue its own interests by using and sacrificing other countries that have nothing to do with the issue.
The government of the DPRK made a request to the UN Secretariat that a forum of international law experts be organized to assess legal grounds and lawfulness of the UNSC ""resolutions"", but we have not heard anything from the Secretariat for 9 months already.
Same is true of the fact that the DPRK made repeated requests to the UNSC to discuss the serious threat to international peace and security posed by the aggressive and provocative U.S.-south Korea large-scale joint military exercises, but these requests were never put on the UNSC agenda, rather turned down every time.

The UN Charter stipulates that the members of the United Nations accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
If the ""resolutions"" on the DPRK adopted at the Security Council are truly lawful and
fair, there will be no need that all U.S. ambassadors abroad and even the President and
the State Secretary turn out to coerce other countries into implementing the ""resolutions"". Furthermore, there will be no need for the U.S. to bring its stooges like south Korea and Japan into this.
The UN member states should not yield in to pressure of an individual big power in dealing with the UNSC resolutions but make an independent judgment on lawfulness, impartiality and morality of the resolutions and contribute to promoting reform of the UNSC by further raising their voices against high-handedness and arbitrariness.
Mr. President,
The U.S. had put sanctions against our country from the very first day of its foundation and the over 70-year long history of the DPRK can be said in a sense a history of struggle, persevering along the road of self-development under the harshest sanctions
in the world.
Through such a prolonged and arduous struggle, now we are finally only a few steps away from the final gate of completion of the state nuclear force. It is only a forlorn hope to consider any chance that the DPRK would be shaken an inch or change its
stance due to the harsher sanctions by the hostile forces.
The day will certainly come in near future when we settle all damages inflicted to our peaceful economic development and improvement of the people's livelihood and all the sufferings imposed on our innocent women, children and elderly by the heinous and barbaric sanctions against our Republic.
The DPRK already organized a national damage investigation committee to make comprehensive study of total damages inflicted on our Republic by all kinds of
sanctions.
This committee will thoroughly investigate and compile all physical and moral damages imposed upon the DPRK by the U.S., its followers and also those countries
that submitted to the U.S. coercion.
When this racket of sanctions and pressure reaches a critical point, thus driving the Korean peninsula into an uncontrollable situation, investigation results of this committee will have a huge effect in holding those accountable.

Mr. President,
My delegation takes this opportunity to extend strong support to and solidarity with the Cuban government and people who are fighting to defend national sovereignty and realize international justice against the high-handedness, arbitrariness and unilateral embargo of the U.S. We also express strong support to and solidarity with the government and people of Venezuela who are fighting to defend the national sovereignty and the cause of
socialism.
The unjust and contemptible acts such as turning a blind eye to the heinous acts of Israel while condemning in every manner only the Syrian government fighting to protect its national sovereignty and security should not be tolerated any longer. The DPRK government will certainly defend peace and security of the country with its powerful nuclear deterrence and also contribute to safeguarding world peace and security. Thank you, Mr. President.

Denmark,"Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
This General Assembly is opening amidst a period of unprecedented change.
Threats and challenges such as poverty, terrorism, climate change, violations of human rights, gender inequality, armed conflict, displacement and irregular migration are ever more inter-connected. Our responses to these challenges must reflect their complexity. Our responses will require better and deeper cooperation and must involve more stakeholders, new solutions and more effective international institutions.
The evolving global landscape gives us an opportunity to renew and redefine how we work together. The United Nations must seize this opportunity. Denmark congratulates Mr. Ant6nio Guterres on the successful beginning of his term as Secretary-General. You can count on Denmark's full support in your efforts.
More than ever, we need leadership and common purpose to steer this organization in a new direction. Staying on the current path is not an option if we want to maintain the legitimacy of the United Nations. Fundamental and ambitious reform is the only way forward .
1


Mr. President, This week, the Secretary-General has laid out a strong vision for a reformed United Nations and a call for action to all - from Governments to the staff of this great organization to our partners outside this building: we must all invest in and commit to this agenda for change. As Member States, we have a responsibility to find common solutions that will turn our shared goals into positive change and protect the principles and values of the United Nations.
That spirit must also guide our work in the years to come. Denmark is committed to international cooperation through the UN, built on shared values, the rule of law and human rights.
That is one of the reasons why Denmark is running for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the term 2019-2021. Denmark has never before been a member of the Human Rights Council. As a long-standing supporter of the United Nations and with a consistent advocate of the protection of dignity and rights of all people, we believe that we would make a significant contribution in the Council, based on a commitment to promote dignity, dialogue and development.
*** Mr. President, Denmark is committed to an ambitious follow-up of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement - at home and abroad. We have provided at least 0.7 per cent of our GNI in ODA for the last 40 years and will continue to do so in the future. We call on all developed countries to realize the 0.7 per cent target.

With only 13 years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we have no time to waste in fundamentally rethinking the United Nations Development System and its support for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
The Secretary-General has presented a set of clear reform proposals. Now we must come together and support their implementation. This is not a donor vs. developing country, a North vs. South, debate. No, let us support the Secretary General's plan because we agree that we all have an interest in a United Nations that is cost-effective and creates coherent and sustainable solutions on the ground. Citizens around the world expect nothing less.
We need to break with the status quo particularly in four priority areas:
First, a reformed UN Development System must deliver on the promise of unified country-level engagements where silo-thinking, competition for resources and fragmented support strategies become a thing of the past.
Second, in our response to the many complex crises around the world, we need to create a stronger bridge between immediate relief and long-term development objectives.
Our support for the UN's humanitarian work is as strong as ever. Denmark is one of the world 's largest humanitarian donors, and in our 2018 aid budget we will allocate more funds to humanitarian action than ever before. We are fully behind the Secretary-General's call for a New Way of Working in responding to protracted humanitarian crisis and displacement.

We must meet the needs of those affected while also creating hope for a better future. The New Way of Working is about much stronger cooperation and coordination between partners in and outside the UN System - and Denmark will continue to play a leading role in advancing this agenda.
Thirdly, the UN Development System needs to be built on the basic premise that neither the United Nations nor governments have the capacity or resources to realize the 2030 Agenda. Partnering with the private sector, civil society, academia and innovators will be crucial. The UN must rethink how it incorporates these resources on our way towards the 2030 goals
Denmark is taking lead to support strong, meaningful, principle-based partnerships. Together with our strategic partners, Chile, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mexico, Republic of Korea, and Vietnam, the Danish Government this week launched a new initiative in support of the 2030 Agenda - Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 - P4G.
P4G brings together Governments, companies, cities, think tanks and investors to create and boost public-private partnerships for a greener tomorrow. Through P4G, we will leverage partnerships which will help us take better care of our planet.
Fourthly, Denmark welcomes the Secretary-General's strong commitment to gender equality in our reform efforts. Women and girls all over the world must be empowered to contribute to stronger communities and societies. Ensuring women equal opportunities is crucial for reaching the SDGs.

In the Danish Government's view, gender equality is first and foremost a question of dignity and ensuring the human rights of all women and girls, including safeguarding sexual and reproductive health and rights. This is fundamentally about the right to decide over one's own body.
As one of the founding members of the SheDecides movement, Denmark is committed to continuing to push for progress and to protect the rights of all women and girls. Just recently, Denmark announced a major increase in our contribution to UNFPA.
Too many young people today face lack of opportunities and poverty. We have the largest youth population in history. Denmark is committed to helping youth get the means and skills required to be drivers of development.
***

Mr. President,
 If we want to create a more stable and peaceful future, Member States must
 adhere to international law and common rules for coexistence and cooperation.
 Regretfully, we still see Member States who put national interests before
 respect for the dignity and rights of their citizens or ignore the legitimate
 concerns of their neighbors as well as regional and global stability.

The nuclear and missile tests conducted by the Government of the Democratic
 People's Republic of Korea constitute a blatant disregard of our collective
 security, non-proliferation norms and rules and the continued demands by the
 Security Council.

5

Denmark strongly condemns this irresponsible behavior and calls on the regime in Pyongyang to deescalate the current situation and commit to a peaceful solution in conformity with the resolutions of the Security Council.
The recent outbreak of violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State is deeply concernmg. Denmark calls on the Government of Myanmar to facilitate humanitarian assistance to all those in need and commit to aiding the safe return of civilians fleeing from the conflict. We welcome the Government's commitment to implement without delay the recommendations of the Advisory Commission led by former Secretary General Kofi Annan. Violence must stop and the security forces must ensure protection of civilians. We condemn the attacks on security forces and the subsequent serious human rights violations.
We applaud the government of Bangladesh for providing protection to civilians fleeing across the border. Denmark stands ready to assist both Myanmar and Bangladesh in pursuing integrated humanitarian and development solutions for the affected areas.
Mr. President, Denmark stands in solidarity with all those affected by terrorism and violent extremism. We continue to be an active participant in the fight against these threats to our societies, including through our military and civilian contributions to the Global Coalition against Da'esh in Iraq and Syria. And we are a key partner in other conflict areas such as Afghanistan, Mali, the Sahel and Somalia.

To defeat terrorism, we need to supplement our military effort with broad-based engagements that also focus on cutting off terrorist financing, repelling extremist propaganda online and offline as well as stabilizing areas liberated from Da'esh and building peace in conflict-affected countries.
The United Nations plays a central role when it comes to stabilizing war-torn countries and building lasting peace. But comprehensive reforms are needed. Denmark welcomes the vision of the Secretary-General for the peace and security architecture of the UN with a streamlined, coordinated and effective response in the field.
As Member States, we have an obligation and a shared interest to support these critical reforms so that the United Nations can fulfil its purpose and its promise to the world. The time for bold ambitions is now.
If we do not support reforms , if we deny generations' hope and opportunity for a more prosperous future , we will continue to witness international turmoil and unprecedented levels of displacement. People forced to leave their homes and venture out on dangerous journeys. Many falling into the hands of relentless smugglers and traffickers.
Denmark contributes significantly to help displaced populations and others in emergency situations to live dignified lives. Last year, Denmark contributed more than 80 mill USD to the Syrian crisis alone. Our programs focus on helping refugees in their regions of origin, which enable us to use our funds most efficiently and ultimately help more people.
7

Unmanaged migration poses a significant global challenge and we need to strengthen our cooperation and commitment to existing international legal frameworks. In this regard, Denmark welcomes the dialogue taking place in preparation for the Global Compact on Migration.
***
Mr. President,
 Through leadership and a renewed commitment to a reformed United Nations;

Through innovation and willingness to challenge old ways of thinking;

Through strong partnerships across the public-private spectrum, across age and
 gender divides, across different organizations and institutions;

The opportunity to create a new path for our united nations is here.
I thank you."
Dominica,"Mr. President;
I come to you straight from the front line of the war on climate change.
With physical and emotional difficulty/ I have left my bleeding nation/ to be with you here today/ because these are the moments for
which the United Nations exists!
It is why we/ collectively/ have always respected/ and hold dear/ the
values ofthis institution!
We congratulate you/ Mr. President/ on your appointment/ and wish you well/ in upholding the ideals of humanity's/ greatest invention!

And in keeping with this institution's regard for fraternity/ we take this opportunity to express our condolences to our brothers and sisters in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Cuba, St. Maarten, St. Thomas, the British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos islands, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic/ and also to those who have suffered losses in our host country, the United States - in Texas and Florida.
And to our brothers and sisters in Mexico/ we stand in prayerful solidarity/ after the catastrophic earthquake this past week.
Mr. President/ warmer air and sea temperatures have permanently altered the climate/ between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.
Heat is the fuel that takes ordinary storms - storms we could normally master in our sleep - and supercharges them into a devastating force.
In the past/ we would prepare for one heavy storm a year.
Now, thousands ofstorms/ form on a breeze in the mid-Atlantic/ and
line up to pormd us/ with maximum force and fury.
Before this century/ no other generation had seen more than one
category 5 hurricane in their lifetime.
2

In this century, this has happened twice...and notably/ it has happened in the space ofjust two weeks.
And may I add/ Mr. President, that we are only mid-way into this
year's hurricane season.
In the case ofDominica, it has been only 2 years since we lost lives/ and enduredsubstantial physical and infrastructural damage/ from the ravages ofthe floods and mud slides of Tropical Storm Erika.
Mr. President/ to deny climate change/ is to procrastinate while the earth sinks; it is to deny a truth we have just lived!
It is to mock thousands of my compatriots/ who in a few hours/ without a roof over their heads/ will watch the night descend on
Dominica/ in fear ofsudden mud slides.. .and what the next hurricane may bring.
We/ as a country/ and as a region/ did not start this war against
nature! We did not provoke it! The war/ has come/ to us!!
Mr. President/ my fellow leaders/ there is no more time for
conversation! There is little time left for action.
3

WhUe the big countries talk, the small island nations suffer. We
need action....and we need it NOW!!
We in the Caribbean do not produce greenhouse gases or sulphate aerosols. We do not pollute or overfish our oceans. We have made no contribution to global warming/ that can move the needle. But yet, we are among the main victims.. .on the frontline!
In the Commonwealth of Dominica, we have long pursued and respected an existence that preserves our Little Eden.
The Mome Trois Pitons has been a national park for 40 years and a UNESCO World Heritage Site for 20. Our livelihoods are part ofour ecosystem. This is how my people and my country earn and survive!
But what is our reality at this moment?
Pure Devastation!!...as Dominicans bear the brunt of climate
change. I repeat - we are shouldering the consequences/ of the actions of others! Actions that endanger our very existence...and all/ for
the enrichment/ of a few elsewhere.
Mr. President,

We dug graves today in Dominica! We buried loved ones yesterday and I am sure that as I return home tomorrow, we shall discover additional fatalities, as a consequence of
this encounter. Our homes are flattened!
Our buildings roofless! Our water pipes smashed.. .and road infirastructure destroyed! Our hospital is without power!...and schools have disappeared
beneath the rubble.
Our crops are uprooted.
Where there was green/ there is now only dust/ and dirt!
The desolation is beyond imagination. Mr. President, fellow leaders - The stars have fallen !
Eden is broken!!
The nation of Dominica has come here/ to declare an international/
humanitarian/ emergency. One that is centred in Dominica/ but also encompasses many of our neighbours/ including our sister isle, Antigua/ which had to evacuate its citizens from Barbuda.
Dominicans, Mr. President, have been responsible members of the global community. We have co-joined all of the major international
5

battles; from the abolition of forced labour to the protection of
patents.
Yet, today, 72,000 Dominicans lie on the front line/ in a war they did not choose.. ..with extensive casualties/ from a war/ that they did not
start!
The time has come for the international community to make a stand/ and to decide; whether it will be shoulder to shoulder with those suffering the ravages of climate change worldwide; Whether we can mitigate the consequences of imprecedented increases in sea temperatures and levels; whether to help us rebuild sustainable livelihoods; or whether the international community will merely show some pity now, and then flee....; relieved to know that this time it was not you.
Today, Mr. President, we/ the small nations of the world/ need to
know who our real friends are! Who have our backs!!
Not all countries are sitting as inactive bystanders. Some of our traditional friends are playing their part.
The United Arab Emirates/ for example/ have risen to the challenge.

We commend Sheik Mohamed A1 Maktoom of UAE/ for his
aimouncement/ in this year of Zayed/ to boost the theme of giving by ""delivering even more goodness to all parts ofthe world"".
Today, we invite nations of similar might/ to follow the lead of The
United Arab Emirates!
Mr. President/ the success ofthe C0P21 in Paris/ is a demonstration
of the collective political will of Member States to take action/ to combat climate change.
One year on, the call for urgent action is even greater/ if we are to curtaU the impact of climate change on us/ and future generations.
We need all ofhvunanity/ all countries - big and small; developed and developing/ to come together/ to save our planet! We must all live up to our obligations/ and commitments/ to do more!
Inaction, and even inadequate action, destroys lives.
The Green Climate Fund/ that was created to assist/ in putting mitigation measures in place/ and to assist the victims of climate change/ is commendable. But much more must be done to assist
7

countries that continue to bear the brunt of the impact of climate change.
The World Bank established the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility to assist coimtries that have been impacted by
natural disasters.
Though helpful/ the amoimts are usually grossly inadequate/ to rebuild infrastructure/ and to maintain the gains and progress made in economic and social development/ after the likes ofHurricanes Maria and Irma/ or even in the case of a Tropical Storm like Erika/ that occurred two years ago.
Substantially more funds must therefore be made available to vulnerable countries/ for loss and damage/ such that they may mitigate the risks associated with future incidents.
>
The World Bank facility must be re-capitalized for greater coverage/ by using already committed funds from the Green Climate Fund. This would allow our countries to focus on improving the lives ofour people and support the attainment of the Sustainable Development
Goals.

It would allow us to rebuild our nation/ not as it was/ but in a manner
that is far more capable/ to meet the realities of rising sea levels/ and
warmer oceans.
Not to do so/ Mr. President, would be to abandon those who have paid a steep price/ for what others/ elsewhere/ have created.
It would be to let 72,000 Dominicans shoulder the world's conscience on climate change/ on their own.
Today, we ask you not to express your sjmipathies this week...but then hope our eyes do not meet next week.
Let these extraordinary events, elicit extraordinary efforts, to rebuild nations/ sustainably.
Let these extraordinary events/ unleash the innovation and creativity of global citizens/ to spark a new paradigm of green economic development/ that stabilizes/ and reverses/ the consequences of human-induced/ global warming.
Let it spark a thousand points of light.. .not shame.
Let us take serious action against the realities of climate change..
9

And I promise you, Mr. President, that Dominicans and other Caribbean citizens/ will play our part.
We are in shock, but/ we are not stooped!
We cry; but do not despair!
We will rise! ...Because Dominican people are strong. Because Caribbean people are resilient!
We will rebuild our Garden ofEden again ...for our children and for future generations.
Mr. President, as a result of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015, we committed to creating a National Vulnerability Risk and Resilience Fund/ to improve the ability of our Government to respond to the impact ofnatural disasters. That facility has not yet been capitalized.
We intended to place fimds/ from our own treasuiy/ on an annual basis. But, our capacity to earn has now been significantly compromised/ even before we have gotten it off the groimd.
10

Today we need all the things required in a natural disaster/ that has
affected an entire nation.
We need water, food and emergency shelter.
We need roads, bridges and new infrastructure.
But we also need capabilities of delivery....
I call upon those with substantial military capacities/ to lend us the rescue and rebuilding equipment/ that may be standing idle waiting for a war; Let Dominica today be that war because currently, our landscape reflects/ a zone of war.
The battle we face has brought us to our knees.
We need resources/ NOW!.. .so that we may move/ with purpose/ to the task of rebuilding our beautifiil island home.
We will need to rebuild homes and villages. We will need to rebuild communities, schools, roads and bridges. We will need to rebuild a country.. .and we caimot do it alone.
11

Above all else, Mr. President and members of this August body, we need you! We need your humanity! .. ..and we need you now/ to act/
truly/ as OUR/ United Nations!! I thank you!
12"
Dominican_Republic,"His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajcak, President of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations;
His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN;
Heads of State and Governments;
Honorable Ministers and Heads of Delegations;
Ladies and Gentlemen;
It is an honor to participate in this General Assembly of the United Nations, representing the people and government of the Dominican Republic.
Before anything else, I would like to apologize on behalf of Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina, for his absence from this forum, as he had to return to the country to face Hurricane Maria's threat.
This meeting coincides with a devastating season of natural disasters endured by our region for nearly a month; the widespread catastrophe extends to Mexico, hit by two destructive earthquakes, and to the Southern United States, viciously punished by Hurricane Harvey.
In this catalog of human suffering Antigua and Barbuda stand out, but in particular this last one where, according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne, 90% of the infrastructure collapsed.
Not quite has Irma's devastating winds dissipated when there is Maria leaving a new trail of destruction and death, mainly in Dominica.
We express our deep solidarity with the affected countries and the sadness of the people of the Dominican Republic for the destruction and high number of victims.
Accurate figures for damages at Saint Bart, Saint Martin, Anguilla, Virgin Islands, Tortola, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and, particularly, Cuba, and Florida are yet to be determined.
However, we can affirm that there is substantial damage; recovery will take years.
Unfortunately, valuable lives have been lost as well.
Despite the absence of definitive figures, I can tell you, so that you get an idea of how severely we have been affected, that the material losses produced only by this hurricane season far exceed the Gross Domestic Product of the Dominican Republic.
We often tend to focus on material damage and ignore the human suffering caused by these disasters  which lethal power has been enhanced by climate change.
1

The statistics are striking, but cannot reflect the pain of the victims, their desolation to see so many efforts ruined, so many illusions, so many dreams.
Not merely houses have been lost; homes have been lost.
Well beyond material debris, there are shattered lives.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary, distinguished delegates;
We must recognize the inherent dangers of climate change, which are way more significant within the context of our Caribbean geography.
Our economies, our way of life, and our development potential are at in danger.
The Caribbean vulnerability and that of our Dominican Republic pose a risk that we cannot face alone.
Although our country has been fortunate not to suffer human losses during the catastrophic passage of Irma, we are aware that, like every other Caribbean island, we will always be vulnerable to this type of phenomenon.
This reality leads us to bring up in this Assembly, once more, the imperative need to join forces to confront these threats.
It compels us to act in a responsible, cohesive way for the sake of our people's lives.
And I would like, if you will allow me, to be very clear in this regard.
It is not enough to send messages of solidarity or humanitarian aid after natural catastrophes have caused death and devastation.
And it is absolutely not enough to sign agreements on climate change.
It is critical for these agreements to be coherent, move forward a joint agenda, and develop concrete action plans.
We are facing a growing challenge, which does not recognize borders, makes us all vulnerable, and demands everybody's cooperation and solidarity but mainly that of the most developed, most powerful nations.
If we don't want to keep regretting its consequences, we must tackle this reality with maximum responsibility.
Therefore, once more, my country brings before this Assembly the proposal to create a special fund to deal with natural catastrophes, to foster awareness, prevention, and resilience strategies, which will allow us to preserve life.
2

To illustrate how economic resources can help alleviate the damage caused by natural phenomena lets use the example of the United States.
Right at the aftermath of recent hurricanes, the government, which has the necessary resources, made available a fund of 15,000 million dollars for the reconstruction of the affected states.
Thus providing much needed assistance to their citizens.
On the contrary, there is no way that vulnerable regions, such as the insular Caribbean, can cope on their own with the crushing impact that such a phenomenon has on our people and countries.
I will use my country, the Dominican Republic, as an example:
Because of the rain and floods caused by natural phenomena during the previous year, thousands of kilometers of highways and country roads have been badly damaged.
There are dozens of collapsed bridges; tens of kilometers of collapsed gabion-walls and irrigation channels.
Thousands of hectares of diverse crops indispensable to feed our citizens have been lost as well.
In addition, among other numerous damages, not counting those recently caused by Hurricane Irma, hundreds of homes have been destroyed.
Only to support relief efforts over these months we have invested more than five hundred million dollars.
Thus we fear that similar or even stronger phenomena triggered by climate change-- may delay by ten years or more, our country's and other Caribbean nations' development path.
We are talking about snatching our people's happiness and positive future projections.
We cannot afford to keep down playing this reality.
And it is in this context that the United Nations' role and the solidarity between our countries make sense.
I appeal to you, once again, on behalf of all the children, women, men, and old people who at this moment face the most absolute helplessness.
Let us find ways for the United Nations to help those governments that cannot rebuild their countries on their own in the aftermath of these natural disasters.
Let us take the essential steps to provide timely aid to those in desperate need.
This is central to our responsibility as sister nations.
I would also like to call all member states of the United Nations to reflect on the new actions that we must take, urgently, to counteract extreme climatic phenomena.
3

There is enough scientific evidence linking human impact on global warming and these natural catastrophes. It is time to assume our role and act accordingly to stop this situation, if we do not want the future to judge us by our total lack of responsibility. Ladies and Gentlemen, Since its founding 72 years ago, our country has been member of this unique chapter in humankind's history that constitutes the creation of the United Nations. This organization has since been a beacon that points the way leading humanity away from the abyss guiding us towards a hopeful future. And this is why we can never fall into complacency. We know that essential aspects of our civilization such as peace, security, and development are not a gift that has fallen from the sky, nor something we can take for granted. They result from a collective commitment, which must be continuously renewed. The Dominican Republic is fully committed to this vision and to the search for integral solutions to the collective challenges facing the international community. We are determined to contribute strongly to build an increasingly democratic, increasingly participatory, and increasingly efficient United Nations to help solve our people's pressing problems. Thank you very much.

Egypt,"Mr. President Miroslav Lajfik, President of the General Assembly,
Allow me at the outset to congratulate you for assuming the presidency of the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish you all success in carrying out your duties. I also seize this opportunity to express the utmost appreciation to Mr. Peter Thomson, the president of the 71st session of the General Assembly, who has most ably overseen the work of the previous session.
Mr. President,
Each time we meet at this august body, we rekindle the hopes and aspirations of the peoples whom we are honored to represent and serve, to provide them with peace and development. New generations look up to us to realize their dreams for a decent life within a just international order; a global order that can face challenges, such as climate change, natural disasters, diseases and epidemics, as well as other man-made crises such as war, terrorism and the huge discrepancies in the distribution of resources and development opportunities.
It is evident that the purposes and principles of the United Nations are still valid as a basis for a world that offers everyone an opportunity to benefit from the great strides in scientific advancement, economic development, as well as the information revolution, which has brought societies ever more closer in an unprecedented manner. These developments offer great potential for establishing a just and secure international order; one that is based on the right to development, freedom, progress and open interactions between peoples.
In Egypt, we adamantly believe in the values of the United Nations and the purposes of its Charter. We have great confidence that realizing such values is not only possible, but rather an obligation and a necessity.
Egypt's longstanding involvement with the UN, both as a founding member of the United Nations that has been elected to the Security Council for six times, and the seventh largest contributor to peace keeping operations world-wide, bears witness to our constant strive to build a world that is worthy of the aspirations of our children and grandchildren to live in freedom, dignity, security and prosperity.
The responsibility that we bear necessitates that we be frank in saying that this world that we seek and is very possible to achieve remains unfortunately far from reality. We are still unable to prevent armed conflict,

confront terrorism, realize nuclear disarmament and address the major structural imbalances in the international economic order, which have widened the gap between the developed and developing worlds.
Based on the experiences of the African and Arab regions, I can state with a clear conscience that these experiences summarize the current crisis in the international order, and its inability to deliver on the goals of this organization.
The Arab region, Egypt's civilizational and cultural milieu, has today become an epicenter for some of the most vicious civil conflicts in recent human history. It is the most prone region to the dangers posed by terrorism. One out of every three refugees in the world today is an Arab, and the Mediterranean Sea has became a conduit for irregular migrants from Asian and African states, who are fleeing the scourge of civil strife, as well as the despair of economic and social hardships, as reflected in the Arab regional report on multi-dimensional poverty conducted by the League of Arab States in collaboration with the United Nations.
As Egypt's geographical home, Africa lies at the heart of Egypt's foreign policy, for it is in Africa that our historic roots lie, and it is from Africa that we derive pride in our identity and our deep sense of belonging. This continent has also become subject to the same security threats facing the Arab region, and constitutes a major example of the crisis in the current international economic order, which cements poverty and economic disparity. This global order bears a major responsibility in the economic, political and social crises that threaten international peace and stability, rendering any discussion on sustainable development goals futile.
Mr. President,
Egypt is encircled by the most dangerous crises in the world. It is our destiny to navigate confidently through these unprecedented dangers, relying on an ambitious development strategy based on radical and bold economic reforms. Such reforms aim at empowering the youth, who represent the majority of the population, not only in Egypt but also in most of the societies of the Arab countries and the developing world.
In a world that is interconnected, complex and full of challenges that cannot be confronted by any country alone, regardless of its capabilities, it is imperative for Egypt's ambitious development plans to correlate with an active foreign policy strategy. Such a strategy is guided by the long established moral principles ingrained in our heritage and culture, and abides

by the legal principles of the international system, which Egypt has actively participated in formulating. It is also based on a vision to address the shortcomings that have prevented the realization of the objectives of the United Nations.
Our vision is based on the following five main principles and priorities:
First: The only solution to the of the crises afflicting the Arab region is through upholding the notion of the modern nation-state, which is based on the principles of citizenship, equality, rule of law and human rights, thereby defeating any attempts at retracting to doctrinal, sectarian, ethnic or tribal loyalties. The path towards reform passes inevitably through the realization of the nation-state, and cannot be built on its
demise.
This principle lies at the core of Egypt's foreign policy, and it is the foundation on which we base our positions in addressing crises affecting our
region.
With regards to Syria, we believe that there would be no salvation for Syria except through a consensual political solution amongst all Syrians at the core of which is the preservation of the unity of the Syrian state, the maintenance of its institutions and the broadening of their political and social base to include all factions of the Syrian society, and to decisively counter terrorism until it is defeated. The way to achieve this is through the UN led negotiations process, supported by Egypt as stridently as we reject any attempt to manipulate the tragedy in Syria to establish international or regional zones of influence, or to carry out the subversive policies of some regional parties, whose practices have caused great suffering to our region over the past few years. It is now high time for a final and decisive confrontation with these practices.
Similarly, we believe that a political settlement is the only viable solution to the ongoing crisis in Libya. Libya continues to face attempts to dismantle the state and to turn it into an open field for tribal conflicts, a field of operations for terrorist organizations, and a theatre of activity for arms and human traffickers. Here, I would like to emphasize very clearly, that Egypt will not allow the continuation of attempts to tamper with the unity and integrity of the Libyan state, or to undermine the capabilities of the Libyan people. We will continue to work diligently with the United Nations

to achieve a political settlement based on the 'Sokhairat Agreement."" This political settlement is inspired by the recommendations agreed upon between Libyans during their consecutive meetings in Cairo during the last months. The aim is to end the current political stalemate, and to revive the settlement process in the country.
The aforementioned same logic applies to the Egyptian strategy regarding the crises in Iraq and Yemen. A unified, capable and just modem nation-state is the only way to overcome the current crises, and to realize the legitimate aspirations of Arab peoples.
Seeon_____d"" It is time for a comprehensive and final settlement to the longest outstanding crisis in the Arab region, namely the Palestinian cause, which is a clear depiction of the international community's inability to implement a long series of United Nations and Security Council resolutions. The closure of this chapter through a just settlement, based on established international norms and principles, establishing an independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, is a necessary precondition for the entire region transit into a new phase of stability and development. This is also necessary to restore the credibility of the United Nations and the international order. Undoubtedly, achieving peace will eliminate one of the main excuses terrorism has been manipulating to justify its proliferation in the region. It is time to permanently overcome the barrier of hatred forever. I would like to underscore that the Arabs still extend their hands in peace. Egypt's experience validates that peace is possible, and is indeed a realistic objective that we should all continue seriously pursuing.
Third: It is impossible to envisage a future for the regional or international order without a definitive and comprehensive confrontation with terrorism. This should be approached in a manner that eradicates terrorism and eliminates its roots and causes, in addition to openly challenging any party that supports or finances terrorism, or that grants it political, media fora, or safe havens.
In all candidness, there is no room for any serious discussion on the credibility of any international system that applies double standards. A system that fights terrorism while tolerating its supporters, and simultaneously engaging them in the discussions on how to eliminate a threat they created in the first place. In order to be true and faithful to our peoples, members of different international alliances should answer the pertinent questions we are raising, for answers are usually avoided by those

who prefer duplicity in order to attain narrow political interests at the demise of states and at the expense of blood shed by their people, which we shall not allow to be lost in vain under any circumstances.
We in the Muslim world need to face our reality and work together to rectify misconstrued notions which have become an ideological pretext for terrorism and their destructive discourse. As you may recall, Egypt has launched an initiative to rectify religious discourse in order to revive the moderate and tolerant values of Islam. Egypt's religious institutions are currently engaged in this process in coordination with relevant international entities worldwide.
Egypt, which is currently engaged in an unrelenting battle to eradicate terrorism from its territory, is committed to track, confront, and eliminate terrorism decisively wherever it exists. It is evident that confronting terrorism has been at the forefront of Egypt's priorities during its membership of the Security Council in 2016/2017, as well as its chairmanship of the Counter Terrorism Committee. This was not only in defense of Egypt's future, but also in defense of the future of the international community as a whole.
Fourth: The elimination of the root causes of international crises and sources of threat to international stability, necessitates the operationalization of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities between members of the international community, in order to narrow the economic and social gaps between developed and developing countries.
How can the United Nations, Agenda 2030, and the sustainable development goals have any credibility when the international economic order is in itself responsible for augmenting disparities in a manner inconsistent with the values of justice and equality?
And how can there be any opportunity for less developed countries to implement fundamental economic reforms to rectify defects aimed at managing their resources, without fundamentally addressing issues that are no less foundational to international economic conditions? This requires involving developing countries more in the international economic governance structure and facilitating their access to easier financing, markets and technology transfer.

Fifth: Settling disputes in our world today can only be achieved through respect for the principles of international law, and negotiation on the basis of legal, historic, and moral principles, as well as the respect of the sovereignty of states and of the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs.
After more than seven decades have elapsed since the establishment of the United Nations, force and zero-sum games cannot remain as a means to realize interests, especially in today's world, which is based on mutual interdependence among nations, and where significant horizons for cooperation and understanding exist to achieve the common interests for
everyone.
Based on the aforementioned principles, Egypt has been at the forefront of countries that have been keen on initiating the Nile Basin Initiative in 1999. It has also pursued the conclusion of a trilateral agreement between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia to address the Renaissance Dam issue from a cooperative perspective, in a manner that establishes a clear legal framework to manage this issue in accordance with international law and established principles, as well as the well established rules governing relations between states sharing basins of trans-boundary rivers all over the world. This agreement remains as the legal framework that can translate the logic of cooperation and sharing between its three parties, as long as good faith persists and the parties apply the agreement fully and with integrity. In this regard, it is of paramount importance to carry out what has been previously agreed upon between the parties in the context of this agreement, especially given the pressing time factor, in order to avoid squandering the opportunity of presenting a successful model for the management of relations between three sisterly countries in the Nile basin.
Mr. President,
In conclusion, our meeting today in this august body, is an opportunity for truthful self-reflection, where we should admit the several deficiencies that hinder the international system from delivering on the noble objectives and aspirations it was set up to realize. It is also an opportunity to renew our commitment to establish a more equitable international order, given that the attainment of justice globally remains a necessary condition to confront the immense challenges impacting our world today, and endangering the credibility of the international system.

The humanitarian tragedy facing the Rohingya minority in Myanmar represents another reason to remind the international community of its moral obligations, let alone its legal responsibilities, as reflected in the UN Charter, to promptly work towards a lasting solution that ends the plight of civilians and addresses the root causes of the crisis, which has become a threat to regional security and the stability of neighboring countries.
Let us move together to empower the people of this world regain control of their destinies, and to explore new horizons of cooperation between members of the international community... Let us transcend together the vicious circle of narrow interests as well as the futile logic of power politics to the broader horizons of common human interests and cooperation among all .... Let us be true to ourselves and dispel the mentality of polarizing policies...For the world today is in dire need to uphold common human interests. It is incumbent upon all states to strive to further relations with all partners with malice to none.
This, Mr. President, was Egypt's message that I have conveyed to you today.., explicitly and clearly. I am full of hope that our joint efforts during the upcoming period will succeed in realizing a better world, which is more secure, stable and prosperous.
Thank you ....
Long live Egypt .... Long live Egypt .... Long live Egypt ...."
Eritrea,"Mr. Secretary General
Excellencies and distinguished delegates.
It is another year and another session of the UN General Assembly. We meet in the same assembly hall and deliver our addresses from the same podium.
Yet, no modicum of protocol can mask the gaping divide in our ranks.
We live in an increasingly fragile, unjust and unequal world. A small minority holds the reins of power and wealth between nations and, for the most part, within nations. The overwhelming majority of nations and tlieir citizens are without power, without voice, without the means for a decent life, and often without peace and security. We may be called the United Nations, but the reality is that we ai*e divided nations and societies.
Despite our deep divisions, however, our destinies are inter-twined in a fundamental way. We share a common home, a small planet in a vast universe, a tiny boat in a vast ocean. Whatever calamity happens anywhere in our world - epidemics, poverty, violence, mass displacement, war, terror- it will eventually catch up with all of us.
We share responsibility to address the fundamental problems of our common world. Certainly, the mighty and wealthy should shoulder bigger responsibility as they command vast power and resources. It is only fair that more is asked from tliose to whom much has been given, or more accurately, those who have appropriated much for themselves. We should unflaggingly remind them of their obligations and press them, not for charity, but for enlightened self-interest that understands that might is not permanent and that only shared benefits are sustainable.
We would, however, be gravely mistaken and would have forgotten the lessons of history, if we pinned all our hopes on the goodwill of those who currently enjoy disproportionate power, wealth and influence. Power does not readily concede its privileges of its own accord. It resorts to deception, coercion, pressure, sanctions, violence and war to maintain and if possible increase its privileges.
The developing countries and the marginalized peoples of the globe stand to gain most from a more peaceful, secure, just and equal world. They owe it to themselves and to coming generations to build solidarity and to steadfastly strive and work and innovate for a better world. It is their duty to ensure freedom, dignity and prosperity to their peoples.
Excellencies,
Africa remains the most marginalized of all continents.

Undoubtedly, there is some progress, more in some countries than others. But talk of an African
Renaissance, of fastest growing economies is misplaced and premature. We should not flatter
ourselves, or allow others to flatter us.
Africa remains a producer and small-bit exporter of primary products. It retains minimum revenue from this export, with foreign companies getting the lion's share. Processing of primary products, value-addition, industrialization, teclinology development barely exist. Afncan economies, physical and social infrastructure, institutional and governance structures, peace and security architectures remainundeveloped.
Yet, Africa boasts tremendous human and natural resources; indeed, over 60% of global natural resources lie in Africa. It is only when Africa's economies, the quality of its infrastructure, the standards of its health and educational institutions, the level of its artistic, scientific and technological products, the effectiveness of its institutions and enterprises, and more importantly the quality of life of its citizens, reflect more accurately its great potential that we can rightly
speakof Africa taking its rightful place in the world.
We should safeguard independence and sovereignty, fight ethnic polarization and rampant corruption, chart our own paths, develop bold and imaginative policies that suit our conditions, rely mainly on our own resources, and build an Africa that meets the aspirations of its people and
makes valuable contributions to humanity.
Excellencies,
Eritrea is a young nation, strategically located and with significant human andnatural resources.
It joined the community of independent nations a quarter of a century ago by dint of its people's long, 30 year long, struggle for freedom and self-determination, fought and won against
tremendous odds.
As an independent nation, it has faced the full brunt of an unfair and unjust international order. It has faced demonization, ostracization, sanctions and armed aggression.
This sustained external hostility caused much harm to Eritrea and its people. It slowed down Eritrea's progress, but it was not able to stop it. It could not shake the resolve of the Eritrean
people and their government.
Eritrea was severely tested. It emerged intact, more determined, experienced, and in many ways stronger. It is peaceful, stable, secure and hai'monious, a haven of stability in a turbulent
neighborhood.
Eritrea is, quietly and without fanfare, engaged in comprehensive nation-building. It is pursuing policies and taking concrete measures to strengthen the unity and hannony of its people, foster their political participation and unleash their energies and talents. It is laying the ground for

broad-based and sustainable economic development. It is step by step putting in place modern infrastructure. It is working to ensure that all its citizens get good access to nutritious food, clean water, electricity, shelter, transport, communications, health and educational services as well as cultural, sports and recreational facilities.
Eritrea has also embarked on a massive, water and soil conservation, as well as an afforestation
program, as part of its comprehensive plan to enhance the environment and fight climate change.
Eritrea is confident it will meet the Sustainable Development Goals ahead of time.
In its ambitious development program, Eritrea avoids dependency, and relies first and foremost on its people and on its domestic resources. At the same time, it welcomes and encourages cooperation and partnership, with a focus on trade and investment.
Eritrea also seeks to make a modest contribution to peace, stability and cooperation in its wider
region, which includes the Nile Basin, the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea Basin and the Gulf. It has successfully fought and continues to fight radicalization, extremism and terrorism on its own and in cooperation with its neighbors.
Eritrea extends its hands of friendship and solidarity to all peoples and nations who strive to build their countries and contribute to a fairer, more just and equal world.
Eritrea takes the initiative to engage with all countries, including those who differ with it.
Eritrea strongly believes that its political, economic, social and diplomatic path would be smoother and easier if the external obstacles that have been on its path were removed. It therefore once again calls on the United Nations Security Council to lift the unfair and unjust sanctions imposed on it for the past nine years. There is no justification for them to continue and they do not serve any useful purpose.
Another impediment in front of Eritrea, indeed in front of the whole Horn of Africa region, is the 15-year old occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory by Ethiopia. Eritrea calls on the Security Council to ensure the end of this flagrant violation of international law and several UN
resolutions.
I thank you."
Estonia,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellences , Ladies and Gentlemen
Our world is unpredictable . Much of this unpredictability stems from climate change. Climate change can be counterbalanced by rapid technological disruption of our wasteful ways of life. But it is easy to see that technological development, at this moment especially the rapid upscaling of digital technologies into the hands of
our billions, while it certainly has a positive transformation potential , adds to the
drfficullie's on.i""nde-rshmd ing Tutu-re .
This new world offers opportunities . Unfortunately, it also enhances the risks. To grab the first and manage the last we need flexible and quick action also on global stage.
Estonia, a nation of just over one million, is sensitive to the fact that unpredictability is especially hard to cope with for those who are inherently weak - poor, disabled, very young or very old. It is hard for those made weak by discrimination - often women , ethnic and religious minorities. Estonia itself has gone through a rapid transformation period of a quarter of a century, after regaining independence. As our economic and social statistics prove, we were quite good to protect the weaker in our society while rapidly adapting and growing our economy . We know it can be done.
We suffered long from Hobbesian position of international community that liberty might bring chaos, that bad rule is better than no rule. Therefore, our guiding principles have been those of John Lock, of rule of law, of checks and balances , of individual rights. Notably, Lock also initially believed what Thomas Hobbes had postulated - but changed his mind while on a diplomatic mission observing a civil society of Brandenburg, the way of life where different ideas had the right to ""quietly coexist"", as he put it. This debate is still with us in the current world .
We now want to offer our know-how on empathic, inclusive development to the global discussion table . Estonia is aspiring to become the elected member of the UN Security Council for the period of 2020-21 . As a small state which was occupied for 50 years of its 100 years of history, we are sensitive to the worries of all those, states and people, who lack capacity to withstand global tides.
There are too many states in the world which suffer from unresolved conflicts. These are states which could take care of their own population and contribute at the global scene, if we were quicker to manage the confl icts which are holding them back or, worse, threatening to tear them apart.

*** 2 ***
Ongoing military aggression in Eastern Ukraine continues to stir conflict and cause casualties amongst the civilians , including loss of a member of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. Crimean peninsula remains occupied , as do parts of Georgia. There are protracted conflicts in Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh .
There are many countries which have been torn apart by the tensions we saw, but could not dissipate in time to avoid the worst.
The world has lost half a million people in Syria. Estonia supports the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, established in December 2016, to assist in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011.
We cannot overlook the escalating sufferings of the people of Yemen or ignore the fate of the Rohingya people . We need to put more effort into humanitarian action to tackle hunger, diseases and epidemics looming in the country. Our common efforts in fighting famine and hunger are also crucial in South-Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria.
Not every state is using its resources and efforts, its technological advances , to the benefit of its people. North Korea is an acute threat to the world peace.
There are also considerable risks to the global stability which are not any more linked to any particular state. The risk of terrorism is metastatic. Having started from disappointments and disillusionment of people from failed and failing states , it has spread globally.
The key to successfully countering terrorism and violent extremism lies in our cooperation on all levels - national, regional and global. The Secretary General's initiative to restructure the counter-terrorism architecture at the UN make the global efforts more coordinated and transparent. Effective counter terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are mutually reinforcing, not conflicting goals .
Ladies and gentlemen, all the above, enhanced already now, but unfortunately even more in the future, by the real effects of the climate change, has led to the highest number of displaced people ever seen globally .
As with all global challenges, the UN is the natural entity to work out and agree on a solution . Last year we agreed the New York Declaration on migration and refugees. We must address the root causes and drivers for irregular migration to improve border management and fight trafficking in human beings.
It includes facilitating the opportunities for legal migration . I would like to emphasize that the underlying basic values of our joint endeavours are humanism and solidarity . A bitter lesson from Estonia's own history, when we were dispersed around the world due to occupations and World War 11 , is how important is the empathy towards the refugees fleeing the atrocities of war and destruction .
2

*** 3 ***

If we want to tackle the root causes of migration, we must tackle climate change . It has become the defining issue of our time. Joint efforts to combat climate change on global scale could never become possible without the coordinating role of United Nations and the platform offered by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We trust Fijian Presidency to achieve concrete results during the 23rd COP this November , building on the Paris achievements from last year .
Ladies and Gentlemen, as the society-led response to the threats of climate change shows, the big, universal problems can be tackled by inclusive societies. Inclusive societies are fundamental to empathic and inclusive development. However , in recent years we have witnessed the shrinking of the space for civil society. This trend must be reversed.
One of the most prominent guarantees for empathic, inclusive development, for democracy and the rule of law is to mainstream gender equality into all areas of life. It is proven that equitable treatment of women and men has a multiplier effect in eradicating poverty. Estonian welfare development plan for 2016-2023 covers policy areas from employment and social inclusion to equal opportunities in applying one's talent in all walks of life. Our goal is balanced participation of women and men in all levels of decision-making and management - both in public and private sectors.
It is important not to forget about gender balance in conflict situations either. Engagement of women already in the early stages of prevention, resolving crises, and building peace reduces the probability of relapses to violent conflict. Therefore, we need to encourage women's participation in peace processes and acknowledge them as actors of change with great potential. And we must never tire in implementing UN Security Council resolution 1325 and related resolutions on women , peace and security on every level. The adoption of the Peace Building Commission's gender strategy last year is a worthy milepost on this road.
For women to futly enjoy their role in the society it is crucial to eliminate gender based violence. We should ensure that survivors are treated with dignity and that the perpetrators are hold accountable for their crimes . Estonia continues to support actions addressing gender based violence and reproductive health needs of most vulnerable women and adolescent girls, for example via UNFPA in Ukraine 2017, and by supporting #shedecides initiative .
I am convinced that Sec General Guterres ' s commendable effort to bring more women into UN decision making is an inspiration to women globally. It will also have tangible effect on UN policy development, making it more empathic and inclusive .

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Today, the use of information technology and Internet are part of everyday life of people everywhere. Estonia can share our experience on how to best utilize e~ governance to achieve the SDGs more efficiently and at lower cost. Estonia has been organizing an event series at the UN with the aim to introduce the already well proven benefits of our e-governance to international community. We hope that the events will lead to concrete action and partnerships. Moreover, this summer Estonia and Singapore launched the Group of Friends on E-Governance and Cybersecurity. The aim of the group is to raise awareness, share best practices and promote capacity building now when these topics are becoming increasingly important at the UN level.
Digital change is everywhere. Its biggest effecton us right now Is rnakinp qecqraphy obsolete. Attacks via cyberspace know no range. Friendships and partnerships formed in cybersphere know no borders . It makes us closer to each other globally. A digitally enhanced global civil society functions better if states provide their people with safe means of digital communication. In analogue world it is easy to identify yourself, even to people you do not know, as states have provided us with passports. Similar identification need exists in cyber space, yet too few governments provide the means of safe identification. The governments need to catch up and give this possibility to their people, to protect them and to allow them to transact and communicate safely online .
A greater dependence on electronic services has, however, resulted in greater vulnerability in cyberspace . This does not mean we can or should try to stop digital progress . We need to continue efforts to analyse how international law applies to the use of ICT, particularly the principle of due diligence, countermeasures, potential application of the right to self-defence and International Humanitarian Law. I call upon all states, which have not yet done so, to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on cybercrime.
I would also like to underline the statement of the Freedom Online Coalition in which they expressed deep concern over the growing trend of intentional, state-sponsored disruptions of both access and dissemination of information online. No one should be denied the right of peaceful assembly, the freedoms of association , opinion and expression, be it by the means of physical presence or online .
4

*** 5 *** Ladies and Gentlemen, In order to address all the aforementioned challenges successfully we need strong United Nations. Estonia welcomes the Secretary General's UN reform agenda. We strongly support the efforts to link the reform of UN's Peace and Security architecture with the reform of the UN Development System . We welcome the emphasis on conflict prevention and peacebuilding , creating societies resilient to vulnerabilities. Estonia's Chairmanship of the Second Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is being firmly guided by the principles of inclusivity and empath y. It in our common interest that the Second Committee tackles the global challenges that fall under its remit , and we count on your good faith in achieving this. As a 'rnembef 'oft he Accountability, Coherenc-e and Transparency Group Estonia is working closely together with a number of countries to improve the working methods of the Security Council and the functioning of the UN as a whole. We need empathy and inclusivity also in the Security Council. That is why Estonians hope that our first-time candidature for the seat of a non-permanent member for the period 2020-21 will be successful. We regained independence 26 years ago, but already have 22 years of participation in UN peacekeeping under our belt. As a small country we care for all those who are vulnerable in this world. As a digital society we are a story of hope, a story of rapid transformation from poor country recovering from occupation to one which is able to provide for its own citizens and contribute to multilateral cooperation. Again, as a digital state we consider transparency and being close to people an obligation of a state; and are adamant supporters of rules- based decision making and clarity of the processes. We fit in with those who want to make UN more nimble to face the challenges of the 21st century.
Thank you for your attention .

We welcome the appointment of Mr. Antonio Guterres as the new Secretary-General of the United Nations and support his call for a surge in diplomacy for peace in addressing the many crisis situations that the world is facing today. Let me stress here we are behind the Secretary-General in the effort he is making at reforming the Organization in the three interrelated areas -- development,
peace and security and management.
Mr. President,
It is indeed a great pleasure and honor for Ethiopia to preside over the work of the Security Council during this important month when world leaders gather in New York for this session of the General Assembly to discuss issues of global peace, security and development. We would like to express our gratitude to all the delegations that participated at the High Level Open Debate of the Security Council on Wednesday, 20 September 2017, on the Reform of UN Peacekeeping Operations. As one of the leading troop contributing countries, Ethiopia attaches great importance to strengthening the role of United Nations peacekeeping to address challenges to international peace and security.
In this regard, we welcome the unanimous adoption of the
draft resolution we tabled on Wednesday and we thank all
delegations that have co-sponsored the resolution, reaffirming the
central role of United Nations peacekeeping as one of the most

effective tools available to the World Body in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security.
Mr, President,
That the world is facing unprecedented challenges to its peace and prosperity has been all too apparent for quite some time now.
Geo-political tensions reminiscent of the cold war are increasing; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is posing real threats to global peace and securily; terrorism and violent
extremism continues to wreak havoc across different parts of the
world; global income inequality is no longer a development challenge but also a security threat; climate change is not a fiction
but real and we are witnessing its devastating consequences for humankind and the planet. Countries such as my own continue to face this horrendous challenge to their development.
No doubt, there are no quick and easy solutions to these
global challenges, which are unprecedented in scale and magnitude. As the Secretary-General has rightly noted, these global problems certainly require global solutions. That is why
commitment to multilateralism and adherence to principles that
underpin it have never been as urgent as they are currently. This is
what makes the United Nations and it's convening power all the
more indispensable in mobilizing the whole world towards the cardinal goal of collective security and prosperity.
Mr. President,
Only two years ago, three major peace and security reviews were conducted which provided valuable recommendations and which, if implemented, could help the United Nations to keep pace with the changing global security dynamics and effectively respond to new and emerging peace and security challenges in a comprehensive, systematic and coordinated manner. What came out clearly from the three major reviews is that the primacy of politics should be the hallmark of United Nations' approach to the

resolution of conflicts. Indeed, there is no way of resolving the many conflict and crisis situations around the world other than through a political means.
This holds true not only for the crisis in South Sudan closer to home but also to the conflicts that are raging in the Middle East including in Syria and Yemen as well as the dangerous situation in the Korean peninsula. Therefore, it is only by reaffirming our commitments to the letter and spirit of Chapter VI of the UN Charter on the pacific settlement of disputes that we can effectively respond to the global peace and security challenges that we face
today.
However, this is obviously easier said than done. That is because without political will and commitment by conflicting parties to find a political solution through dialogue and negotiation, peace is bound to elude us. The common purpose and resolve of all external actors involved in the search for a political solution to conflict and crisis situations is also absolutely indispensable. What the current global security djmamics requires is a stronger and effective global-regional partnership in the service of conflict prevention and peace. What we have seen time and again is that in the absence of this partnership underpinned by the principle of complementarity and coherence, no meaningful progress can be achieved. The United Nations should be able to play a leading role in forging these kinds of partnerships and share the burden in
accordance with the Charter.
Mr. President,
The interlinkages between peace, security and development has long been recognized and this is also the other key message that came out clearly from the three-major peace and security reviews. More peaceful and inclusive societies create an environment conducive to sustainable development; sustainable

peace is both an enabler and an outcome of sustainable development. The year 2015 was indeed a seminal year in this regard. The commitment that we made in this hall to the
transformative 2030 Agenda sind to leave no one behind was the
result of common conviction that our fates and our futures are
linked and that poverty is a common challenge. The SDGs were further reinforced with the adoption of the Paris Climate Accord which entered into force last November strengthening the global response to the threats posed by climate change.
But today it is no longer the time to celebrate these
achievements but to reflect where we are in terms of their
implementation. Though the SDGs were endorsed by all with so much optimism, the current state of affairs is far from reassuring. The global situation since has not been conducive to ensure a reasonably effective implementation of the SDGs. That is a major disappointment for all those who have been hoping to see renewed global partnership in the spirit of the 2030 agenda.
We on our part have fully embraced and started to register encouraging initial results in implementing the 2030 Agenda. We have continued to invest in our people to improve their well-being. To achieve structural transformation and diversify our economy, the government is expanding the manufacturing sector and
infrastructural facilities that have continued to attract increasing amount of domestic and foreign investment. To finance our ambitious national projects, we are mobilizing domestic resources
while maximizing the positive impacts of foreign assistance.
By implementing integrated pro-poor policies, we have been reducing poverty, enhancing the quality of life, and we have sustained our rapid and inclusive economic growth. Hence, Ethiopia is projected to be the fastest growing economy in the world by 2017. This should, of course, not be a source of complacency,
but an additional drive to redouble our determination and
endeavors to accelerate the full implementation of our current

national development, which integrates the SDGs. We would remain fully committed to realize SDGs, to respond to the legitimate development demands of our people and to address our multifaceted development challenges. And these are not easy and nor are our challenges uncomplicated, most particularly those related to natural phenomenon.
Mr. President,
We in Ethiopia like many other countries are dealing almost eveiy day with the adverse impacts of climate change. Therefore, now is not the time to doubt the devastating impacts of climate change while millions of our fellow humans are losing their lives and their hard-won development achievements. This is high time to act --^and act urgently and decisively-- to combat the adverse impacts of climate change, particularly its disproportionate adverse effect on the most vulnerable countries, which -- as it has been
repeatedly stated--^bear almost no responsibility in causing climate
change.
It is not only poverty that is our major challenge, but also climate change. The current climate-induced drought is affecting millions of people. After successfully dealing with the 2015 El Nino induced-drought, it is for the second consecutive year that Ethiopia is facing the adverse impact of climate change. That is why I said earlier climate change is real and poses a clear danger for humanity, undermining development gains. We are doing everything we could to mitigate its negative impacts, with the continued sind much appreciated support of our bilateral and multilateral partners. While committed to address the current humanitarian emergency, we would also continue to implement our national strategy of building a green and resilient economy.
Mr. President,
Countries like Ethiopia that are fully committed to implement the Sustainable Development Agenda require an enabling

I thank you."
European_Union,"Mr President, Mr Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,
The European Union stands for freedom and a credible rules-based global order. Because this order is a real sine qua non condition for peace, stability and a global economy that works for everyone. An alternative to this order is chaos which always encourages violence, egoism and extremisms.
The United Nations is the best tool we have to address, on a global scale, today's conflicts, famine, forced displacement, terrorism, and a return to nuclear tensions. For the EU and its Member States, it is imperative that the UN rise to these challenges. This is why together we contribute approximately one third of UN core financing, make one third of UN peacekeeping contributions, and put in half of all voluntary contributions to UN funds and
programs.
But we also expect the UN to become a more energetic, and a less bureaucratic organization that can act with clarity and purpose in all its actions. Therefore, the EU considers the reform ideas of the UN currently on the table as the necessary minimum. What is needed is more ambition, not less.

The UN remains a vital forum to debate and a tool to implement our collective will, even if it has declined in popular esteem in recent years. I take the action by the UN Security Council on 11 September to sanction North Korea for carrying out more nuclear testing as a sign that the capacity for real leadership and unity is present. But it is still too little. No country should be allowed to undermine the global non-proliferation regime or to threaten peaceful countries. The European Union calls together with Japan and South Korea, our close friends and strategic partners, for a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. And we also call on all concerned to uphold the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran as a multilateral deal that is delivering more security for us all.
Europe also wants to work in partnership with African countries on challenges ranging from security and counter-terrorism to economic growth and job creation. We look forward to advancing these goals together at the AfricanEuropean summit in Ivory Coast at the end of November. The European Union is already co-operating closely with UN missions on peacekeeping and conflict prevention in Mali, in the Central African Republic and other conflict zones. And we are also doing our best to alleviate a major humanitarian crisis, affecting more than 20 million people, in the Lake Chad Basin, South Sudan and Somalia. But more needs to be done. Now is the time to wake up to these escalating situations before it is really too late.
When it comes to the global refugee crisis, the EU continues to assume its responsibility. By receiving people in need of protection. By assisting host countries closer to the conflict zones. For three years now, the EU has
appealed to the international community to take its responsibility for refugee protection and irregular migration. I am doing the same today.


In that context, the European Union is actively supporting the United Nations process to develop Global Compacts on Refugees and on Regular, Safe and Orderly Migration. Your engagement is needed right now, both in terms of money for humanitarian assistance, and more resettlement for those displaced by conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, and especially across Africa.
At the same time, we should crack down on human smugglers that exploit vulnerable people and violate sovereign borders. I welcome that the International Criminal Court prosecutor is investigating the smugglers in Libya for crimes against humanity. We should treat them via a system of international sanctions just as harshly as those engaged in terrorism and piracy. The European Union calls on the international agencies to increase their presence on the ground in Libya immediately, so that we can work to improve the situation of those victimized by the smugglers.
2016 showed us that Da'esh as a territorial entity is fated for defeat. That's good news. Sadly however, repeated terrorist attacks, also in Europe, demonstrate that the threat continues. So, we need to keep on strengthening the global fight against terrorism and violent extremism. In short, we must be more determined than they are.
Doing more on counter-radicalization within the UN is badly needed. We welcome the establishment by the industry of the Global Internet Counter Terrorism Forum to work in tandem with UN structures. The European Union has called on the major online companies to develop, as a priority, the means for automatic deletion of extremist content immediately after posting. And to the Muslim leaders of the world, I repeat the appeal I made after the London Bridge attack in June: .your strong stance against Islamist extremism will be a real support in the fight against terrorism.


And finally on climate change. The Paris Agreement is the cornerstone of global efforts to tackle in an effective way climate change and implement the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. The EU remains determined to implement the Agreement swiftly and fully, and to support our partners, in particular the vulnerable countries, in the fight against climate change. We will work with all partners who share our conviction that the Agreement is necessary to protect our planet, that it is fit for purpose. And that, in turn, it is good for economic growth and future jobs.
We meet at a time when the world is poised between hope and fear. The global economy and trade are expanding, but security tensions are rising and global co-operation is being increasingly questioned. Making international action robust, credible and transformative is the challenge. The European Union will never give up working with and within the United Nations until we meet this challenge.
The European Union and the United Nations were created in answer to the atrocities of the Second World War. This is why our European priority will always be to vigorously react against evil, violence and lawlessness in the international life. In confrontation with evil, the EU and the UN can not hesitate.
In our political life there are situations that are black and white, that are crystal clear, like in the case of the North Korea's nuclear blackmail, terrorism, or the aggression on Ukraine. And it is then when we need to demonstrate that we are still able to distinguish between good and evil. Sometimes this takes courage. But the UN is not there to cowardly look for a compromise with the evil, but to mobilize the global community in the fight against it. Therefore, a moral judgement of the reality, clear and univocal, should be the first principle
of our common action.


Many people in the world still believe that in this room have gathered those who have not given up on the ethical dimension of politics in the name of their own egoistic interests. Let us show them that their trust is justified.
Thank you."
Fiji,"The President of the General Assembly, The Secretary General of the United Nations, Excellencies, Distinguished delegates
Bula vinaka and a very good evening to you all,
Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating you on assuming the presidency of the 72nd session and to wish you every success in the year ahead. As we all know, the global community faces a great many challenges, of which climate change is only one.

But i'm sure that we all want to send a message of solidarity and sympathy tonight to the millions of people in the Caribbean who are again suffering from the ravages of Hurricane Maria. it is an especially cruel ordeal so soon after Hurricane Irma carved a path of destruction through the Caribbean and southern United States. And the thoughts and prayers of all of us are with those who are affected.
The Fijian people share a special sense of solidarity with those who have either lost loved ones or their homes and possessions in these events. Last year, we lost 44 of our own people and a third of our GDP when Fiji was struck by the biggest cyclone ever to make landfall in the southern hemisphere. So as incoming COP President, I am deeply conscious of the need to lead a global response to the underlying causes of these events. And the appalling suffering in the Caribbean and the US reminds us all that there is
no time to waste.

Mr President, I also want to pay tribute to your predecessor, Peter Thomson - the first Fijian to occupy the presidency of the General Assembly. Ambassador Thomson carried out his role with great distinction. And I especially want to thank him for the role he has played in bringing the parlous state of our oceans to global attention. The Ocean Conference in June that Fiji co-hosted with Sweden was an unqualified success. As a global community, we have begun the massive task of restoring the health of our oceans. And to tackle the overfishing that is stripping our oceans of marine life and depriving many millions of people of a precious resource, now and into the future.
1 salute the United Nations for appointing Ambassador Thomson as Special Envoy for Oceans. It is an honour for Fiji to have one of our own leading this vitally important effort to ensure the implementation of a crucial sustainable development goal.

Mr President, next year will mark the 40th anniversary of Fiji's contribution to UN
Peacekeeping. As a small nation, we have suffered a great deal of pain from the loss of some of our finest troops on peacekeeping duties over the years. But this contribution is a very important part of how we see ourselves as a nation -our men and women in uniform serving the global community by protecting ordinary people in troubled parts of the world.
For 40 years, we have helped to make the world more secure. And now we are determined to make a successful contribution to the wider security of the planet through our leadership of COP23.
Mr President, there is no escaping the fact that climate change is as great a threat to global security as any source of conflict. Millions of people are already on the move because of drought and the changes to agriculture threatening their food security.

Throughout history, we know that human beings will fight over access to water. And unless we tackle the underlying causes of climate change, we already know that some places will become unlivable and others will disappear altogether.
In my own region, three of our neighbours are at risk,
which is why Fiji has offered to give refuge to the people of Kiribati and Tuvalu in a worse case in which
their homes sink beneath the waves altogether.
For the Fijian people, climate change is real. It affects our lives altogether. Whether it is the whole villages we are moving out of the way of the rising seas; the loss of our ancestral burial grounds; the salinity affecting our crops; or the constant threat of destruction to homes and infrastructure of the kind we experienced last year.

The reason our hearts go out to the people of the Caribbean right now is not only because we can empathise with them but because we fear the same fate. And I say to the nations of the world: Imagine another third of your GDP destroyed within a year or so. Imagine another cyclone scoring a direct hit and wiping out decades of development.
It is clear, Mr President, that global warming changes our very understanding of what our national interests are. It challenges us to understand that the only way for every nation to put itself first is to lock arms with all other nations and go forward together. Anything else is self-destructive--for the world and for each nation. It may be tempting for political leaders to show that they are protecting some national industry or near-term economic goal, but at what cost? The wise leader must work hard to convince the people to embrace the path we know we must take.

There is no choice to be made between prosperity and a healthy climate. For how prosperous can we be if we must devote our resources to relocating entire populations or reinforcing major cities? What does it cost to find new places to farm? And what about the consequences for global and regional security if nations begin to compete for safe land or have conflicts over the movements of climate refugees? it is obvious that we need to cooperate.
We need to learn from each other and to use the world's considerable resources to do the most good for the most people. We need to continue to create prosperity and to ensure the well-being of the nations and ecosystems of the world. If we view this as some sort of negotiation in which each country tries to preserve its narrow national interests, we will all lose. We will be powerless to protect our own people from the consequences of climate change. Collective action is the only way forward. Wise men and women will understand that.

Mr President, that is why 1 took on the role of COP President, why 1 eagerly embrace becoming the first Pacific Islander to do so. Because it is about ensuring that my own people flourish and prosper now and into the future. And by collaborating with the other nations of the world through this process, we ensure that together, humanity can flourish and prosper.
Mr President, the ball will be passed to me and Team Fiji in Bonn in November by Morocco, And we thank the Moroccan Presidency of COP22 for making such great strides down the field towards the end game of fully implementing the Paris Agreement. Next year, Fiji will pass the ball to Poland. And i want to assure the Presidency of COP24 that Fiji will be supporting you all the way to the line.

Mr President, our own presidency would not be possible without the wonderful assistance of Germany. We simply could not have staged an event of this size and complexity in Fiji. But out of necessity, we have forged a bond with Germany that is an example to the world of how countries at opposite ends of the earth and of vastly different means and size can work effectively towards a common goal. We did it with Sweden with the Ocean Conference and we are equally proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Germany to deliver what the Paris Agreement was meant to do.
Mr President, Fiji is deeply conscious that governments alone cannot meet this challenge. Which is why we are placing such emphasis on the notion of a Grand Coalition of governments at every level, civil society, the private sector and ordinary citizens moving this agenda forward. ! am reaching out to governors, mayors, leaders of every sort across our societies. People of faith.

People on the front line of the climate struggle. Women. And the young people who represent our
future.
Mr President, we are going to do things in Bonn differently. The formal proceedings will be led by our Chief Negotiator, Ambassador Nazhat Shameem Khan, and I will play a roving role. ! will be on hand to resolve any difficulties in the formal negotiations. But to reflect the importance of our Grand Coalition, ! will be travelling between the two zones in Bonn the formal negotiations and the climate action zone with my good friend, our Climate Champion, lnia Seruiratu, and my fellow Pacific leaders. I am counting on them to help me get the message across that, only by working together can we move this process forward further and faster.

In the Climate Action Zone - the Bonn Zone- Fiji and Germany are bringing together all those who have a part to play in making this Grand Coalition a great transformation. Climate activists, companies at the cutting edge of technology, artists and creative people, dancers and performers. And we will be
stamping this zone with the Fijian Bula Spirit of
optimism and inclusiveness that has made our islands famous the world over.
In the formal zone - the Bula Zone - we want the nations of the world to embrace what we call the talanoa Spirit in Fiji and certain other Pacific countries - a dialogue based on trust, empathy and the collective good. In our experience, it is the best way
of getting things done, especially in difficult
circumstances. Engagement that is respectful, honest, cooperative and acknowledges that no-one, no matter how powerful, can solve the climate challenge on their own. For humanity to survive, flourish and prosper, we have no alternative but to cooperate.

Mr President, we have already established a solid foundation for our work as President. The formal negotiations are progressing. And we are looking forward to ministers and their delegations and representatives of civil society coming to Fiji next month for our Pre-COP. We are already delighted by the energy and sense of purpose of the leaders who make up the Grand Coalition.
i'm especially grateful to the Special Envoy for States and Regions that I have appointed to help me Governor Jerry Brown of California who heads an impressive list of political leaders around the world in the Under 2 Coalition.
Mr President, as we all know, the Paris Agreement calls for global warming to be kept well under two degrees over that of the industrial age and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees.

A year ago, I stood here before being appointed President of COP23 and called for 1.5 degrees to be our target. I meant it then and I mean it now. There is an urgent need to fix this number as our objective and as soon as possible.
I certainly carry with me the authority of the Pacific to pursue this objective. And at this point, I want to pay a fulsome tribute to a Pacific islander who we have just lost but whose legacy will live on in these negotiations. Tony De Bruin of the Marshall Islands took a very powerful slogan to Paris two years ago: ""One point five to stay alive"". We intend to honour Tony's legacy. And I intend to draw upon his spirit during my presidency.
Mr President, as well as ensuring decisive action to limit global warming, we must also do a lot more to make nations and communities more resilient to the effects of climate change. We know we are all going to have to adapt.
Page :1.3 of 16

But we must make special provision for those who are most vulnerable and have the least resources to cope with the catastrophic consequences we are witnessing all around us.
We are pleased to be part of a serious engagement with governments and the private sector to secure innovative and more affordable access to insurance to enable those affected by disaster to recover more quickly, it is a question of fairness and economic development. Because without insurance, restoration and rebuilding is simply too great a burden for many nations and communities.
We are also encouraged by the rapid development of clean, affordable alternative energy solutions for countries across the world. This offers great promise that we can achieve this 1.5 degree target and
prosper.

!

Mr President, I am in no doubt that the role that I have embraced as COP23 President is the most important any Fijian leader has undertaken. I appeal to my fellow Pacific leaders to support me as we tackle the greatest challenge to our own region and the greatest challenge to the world. I want to acknowledge the work of the Alliance of Small Island States these past 30 years, which has consistently looked after the interests of our people. And has reminded the world that our interests are the interests of every global citizen.

We are all in the same canoe. Which is why we will have a Fijian ocean going canoe - a drua - in the main hall in Bonn to remind everyone of the need to fill its sail with a collective determination to move this process forward. To deliver on the promise we made to each other in Paris.

And to all the nations that have yet to ratify the Paris Agreement, please do so.

So, Mr President, 1 appeal to the nations of the world and all the leaders of the Grand Coalition to support me. ! draw my power as COP president from you and i will do everything in my power to use it wisely. Vinaka vakalevu. Thank you. -ENDS -"
Finland,"Mr. President, Secretary-General, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as President of the 72nd session of the General Assembly. Finland fully supports your six priorities and we appreciate the selection of ""People"" as your mandate's centrepiece.
Let me also extend my heartfelt congratulations to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Your determination in reforming the United Nations is laudable. Transparency, accountability, efficiency and gender balance should be the guiding principles of the UN System.
I also welcome your focus on conflict prevention. Successful conflict prevention saves lives and financial resources.
Finland continues to advocate the use of mediation in conflict resolution. Mediation efforts,
when successful, prevent conflicts and decrease human suffering.
Those who are marginalized must be given a voice in peace processes. Women, children and adolescents often pay the highest price in conflicts but they can also help to pave a way out of
the crisis.
Finland has contributed to the establishment of a Nordic network of women mediators.
It aims at sustaining peace through the inclusive and meaningful participation of women in all phases of peace processes.
Peacekeeping and Special Political Missions are at the core of the UN's mandate. Having experience of UN operations since 1955, Finland supports the Secretary General in reforming and making UN peacekeeping more effective.
Following our pledge made in 2015, Finland has significantly increased its participation in the United Nations police missions. Finnish police officers, including a specialized team on sexual and gender based violence in UNMISS, are now deployed in seven UN operations.
It is my strong view that no UN peacekeeper nor any other UN personnel should be associated with misconduct of any shape or form. In particular, there must be zero tolerance with regard to sexual exploitation and abuse. The Secretary General's initiative on a Circle of Leadership is timely and welcome.
Mr. President, In wars, there are no winners. Yet the conflicts continue. In 2016,157 000 lives were lost in
violent conflicts globally. There are almost 68 million refugees in the world today. The conflicts in the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Ukraine are all examples of untold human suffering. But they are not the only ones. The international community has not succeeded in maintaining peace and security.

The grave situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is an urgent concern. The North Korean nuclear weapons programme is a threat to global peace and stability, and it must be stopped. The United Nations Security Council's co-operation on North Korea has been successful. It is important that unity prevails.
At the same time we have seen continued provocations by North Korea. Such behaviour cannot be tolerated by the international community. Finland, as part of the European Union, stands firmly behind the sanctions and calls on others to do the same. A solution can only be sought through negotiations to which the North Korean government must participate without preconditions.
Nuclear weapons represent a severe threat to mankind. As long as nuclearweapons exist there is a risk of a catastrophe. The NPT remains the cornerstone of global non-proliferation and the
foundation for nuclear disarmament.
Finland's approach to nuclear disarmament is result-oriented and pragmatic. It is imperative that the countries possessing nuclear weapons are on board on any negotiations. I call on all nuclear weapon states and countries possessing these weapons to promptly take concrete actions in nuclear disarmament. It is important that the nuclear deal on Iran is honoured by all parties. I also welcome the recent talks on strategic stability between the United States and Russia. It is our hope that they will restart the arms control talks in Europe and globally.
Mr. President,
We must pay closer attention also to other threats. Let me take two examples: Firstly, countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism is a shared priority. As a global body the United Nations is well-placed in the fight against terrorism. I am looking forward to the leadership by the new UN Office of Counter-Terrorism.
Secondly, we must take health security more seriously. Diseases travel across borders rapidly and synthetic biology is an emerging threat. Better prevention and national preparedness is called for. We need global multi-partner collaboration. Finland and Australia are co-chairing an Alliance, which supports health security capacity building. We need to take action before the next pandemic arrives.
Mr. President,
Population dynamics are of great importance. Even though the most rapid phase of global population growth is receding, in many places populations are still growing. This is particularly the case in some African countries where potentially a four-fold increase by the end of the century can take place.
Growing populations often result in rapid urbanisation. Cities offer people many possibilities, and the positive potential of urbanisation is huge. But, if mismanaged, urbanisation can also increase rootlessness, hopelessness, even
radicalisation.

One antidote is to ensure that every individual can reach their potential. Economic opportunities and human rights are vital. People must have a positive stake in their own societies. This will require dedicated efforts at empowering individuals, including access to
education and basic services.
Gender equality is a key priority in the Finnish foreign policy. As a HeForShe IMPACT Champion I attach also high personal importance to this. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health, rights and comprehensive sexuality education is a key factor in sustainable development.
Gender equality and high-quality education as well as work for Agenda 2030 are also Finland's priorities as a candidate for the Executive Board of UNESCO.
Mr. President,
Climate change binds together the south and the north. Over time none of us will be spared from its destructive effects. Besides direct environmental impacts it affects security and results in forced migration.
The rapid implementation of the Paris agreement is even more urgent than a year ago. The Agreement has a clear goal: limiting the temperature rise well below two degrees.
We are not on that path currently. We have to speed up our efforts - the window to act is closing. The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and energy efficiency has to be much faster than we see today. Everyone's effort is needed.
The Arctic is at the forefront of climate change. It is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. If we lose the Arctic, we will lose the whole world. We need to find effective ways to slow down the warming of the Arctic.
One way would be to reduce emissions and impacts of black carbon and methane in the Arctic. The sources of black carbon are known and technological solutions exist. What we need is a common will and determined steps to deal with this issue.
These emissions should be reduced first and foremost in the Arctic. But also global action is needed, as a great deal of the black carbon is transported from outside the area. I firmly believe that tackling this issue is a genuine win-win for the whole humanity. Finland is currently chairing the Arctic Council and combatting climate change is one of our priorities.
Mr. President,
Finland celebrates 100 years of independence this year. The theme of our Centennial is ""Together"". Since the beginning of our independence, Finland has supported and respected the rules-
based international order.

In our interconnected world the promotion of the national interest requires also international efforts. I strongly believe that global challenges and threats must be addressed together by the world community, not only by individual action.
Peace and security, human rights and development belong to all of us. Only together can we make this world a better place.
Thank you!"

FRANCE'S VALUES
It is a privilege to be speaking here before you today and I know who I owe that to. I owe it to all those who, a little over 70 years ago, rose up against a barbaric regime which seized my country, France. I owe it to the nations who heard the cry of these resistance fighters and who sent their children, from America, Africa, Oceania and Asia, to French shores to help. They did not all know what France was, but they knew that defeat for France also meant the defeat of the ideals that they shared, that they were proud of and for which they were willing to die. They knew that their freedom and their values depended on the freedom of other men and women living thousands of kilometers from them.
I owe it to those who, when the war was over, dared to reconcile and rebuild a new international order. To those who, like Ren Cassin, understood that human rights were at the heart of international legitimacy. To those who judged the guilty, picked up the victims, righted the wrongs, to those who wanted to believe that the values that the war violated needed to be restored, values of tolerance, freedom, humanity which are the foundations of the United Nations. Not because these values were good, but because they were fair and allowed the worst scenarios to be avoided.
I am not saying this because I merely want to talk to you about history, but because when I hear many of our colleagues talking about the world today, they they somewhat forget this history that we come from, which now seems exotic or so far from us, so far from our immediate interests, but maybe determines and will determine our lives more than anything.
Ladies and gentlemen, while my country holds a somewhat unique position within the order of nations, this gives it a debt, a debt to all those that have had their voices taken from them. And I know that France's duty is to speak for those that we do not hear. Because to speak for them is also to speak for us, today and tomorrow. And today, it is these forgotten voices that I wish to bring to you.

I listened to Bana, a citizen of Aleppo, and it is her voice that I wish to bring to you here. She has lived in the terror of bombings, police and militias, she has known refugee camps. The Syrian people have suffered enough: it is time for the international community to take note of its collective failure and question its methods.
To establish a lasting and just peace, we must urgently concentrate on the political resolution of the crisis, through transition, as the Security Council unanimously decided in Resolution 2254 in 2015. France, together with its partners, has taken the initiative and is

2
supporting the United Nations' efforts to finally initiate an inclusive political road map in Syria. This is why I hope that we can launch a contact group with all permanent Security Council members and all stakeholders. Today, the ""Astana"" format may prove useful, but it will not suffice. And these last few days have highlighted many difficulties.
We need to equip ourselves with the real means to kick-start negotiations, because the long-term solution will be political and not military. It is in the interest of us all and, first and foremost of course, that of the Syrian people.
In this context, I have set out our two red lines. Firstly, absolute intransigence on the use of chemical weapons. Those responsible for the attack of 4 April this year must be brought before the international justice system, and it must never happen again.
Secondly, the absolute necessity to allow everyone access to treatment, to allow medical structures and protect the civilian populations. France decided to make this one of the priorities for its presidency of the Security Council next month.
Working for peace in Syria means taking action on behalf of the Syrian people but also protecting ourselves from Islamist terrorism, because in Syria and Iraq, our biggest battle is against terrorism. We are acting on behalf of all those who have died in the attacks over the last months  because jihadist terrorism has hit our fellow citizens on every continent, regardless of their religion. We must therefore all protect ourselves by joining forces, and our security becomes the first priority. This is what France is trying to achieve with its initiatives to tackle the use of the Internet by terrorists and fight all their sources of funding.
This is why I wanted to organize a conference in 2018 on this fight during which I will call upon you all to make a commitment. But this is also why France is taking military action within the coalition in Syria and Iraq, within the rule of international law. This fight against terrorism is a military fight, a diplomatic fight but also an educational, cultural and moral fight. We are fighting through our work in the Middle East and Africa, but also in Asia, and we should all unite behind it.
TERRORISM AND THE SAHEL
I listened to Ousmane, a schoolboy in Gao, and it is his voice that I wish to bring to you here. He is living his childhood in Mali in dread of indiscriminate attacks. And yet his only dream is to go to school without risking death. In the Sahel, we are all now committed: the United Nations, the countries of the region within MINUSMA and the G5 joint force, the European Union and its member states, and I would like to pay tribute here to all these players and underline that it is a particularly painful fight which has a high cost in human lives.
Our challenge today is to eradicate terrorism, and to achieve this, strengthen national capabilities so that states themselves can look after their own security. Regardless of the resources we use, we cannot succeed in our shared mission if the countries most concerned cannot assume their own responsibilities. This is why, since taking office, I have supported the deployment of the G5 Sahel joint force and I am now calling for your collective mobilization.
This is also why I want to dedicate myself to boosting support for African peace operations, because they hold the key to the future. We must collectively rethink the


relationship between peacekeeping, regional organizations and host countries. And our ability to meet populations' aspirations for peace depends on this.
Undoubtedly, a military response can never be the only response, and I would like today to insist on the necessity of a political response. I am thinking, of course, of the implementation of the Algiers Agreement and our development policy.
MIGRATION
I also listened to Kouam, and it is his voice that I wish to bring to you here. Forcefully displaced, he crossed Africa before putting his fate into the hands of traffickers in Libya. He crossed the Mediterranean, arrived safely while many others perished at sea. Refugees, displaced people, and those we sadly call ""migrants"" have in reality become a symbol of our times. The symbol of a world where no barrier can stop the march of despair, if we do not transform routes of necessity into routes of freedom.
These migrations are political, climatic, ethnic; these are all routes of necessity. Necessity now means escape, in the face of the persecution to which the Rohingya are falling victim. Over 400,000 refugees, of whom the majority are children. Military operations must stop, humanitarian access must be guaranteed, and law and order must be restored in the face of what is, we know, ethnic cleansing. France will take the initiative in the Security Council on this subject.
Necessity means fleeing to save ones family when war is raging and international humanitarian law is no longer respected, but instrumentalized, as in the strategy of violence used in Syria; exile, when the defenders of freedom are the first targets of the powers that be. Protecting refugees is a moral and political obligation in which France has decided to play its part. By supporting the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees wherever it must intervene, by opening the legal means for resettlement as close as possible to the conflict zones, in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey but also in Niger and Chad, and by defending the right to asylum and absolute respect of the Geneva Convention.
In Paris, on 28 August this year, we brought together the African and European countries the most directly concerned by migration flows on the Central Mediterranean route. We adopted a road map with the priority of combating traffickers who trade in human misery. We must put an end to the unacceptable violations of fundamental rights by establishing a humanitarian infrastructure with the UNHCR and the IOM, helping countries of origin and transit to better control the flows.
But although in the face of terrorism and migration, short-term responses are needed to manage the crises, it is our political will to address the root causes of all of these instabilities that today comes into play. These migration problems, this terrorism, are political challenges above all, which are deeply rooted, for all of us, because it is through genuine development policy that we will be able to address moral and civilizational root causes.
DEVELOPMENT
That is why I have decided that France will fulfill its role in setting a goal of earmarking 0.55% of our national income to official development assistance within the next five years.

4
I thank you for your applause, but please let me put this into perspective. First because I know some people expect more and that it is never enough and that France today is not doing enough; but especially because the point is not so much the money. It is the efficacy of this money. It is what we decide to do with it. It is about making better assessments, being better responsible for this money that all of us are contributing.
So, yes, I would like to see France contribute sufficient amounts of official development assistance but I would above all like to see more innovation, more intelligence, different methods used and more responsibility on the ground when it comes to this assistance; that is what I would like, along with you. The challenge today is for this official development assistance to arrive on the ground simply, efficiently, having been assessed, and to the destination that was initially sought; that is what we wanted to do, for example, with the Alliance for the Sahel that we launched with the European Union, the World Bank and UNDP.
And then, it is important to have clear priorities, the first being to invest in education because it is with education that we will win this fight against obscurantism, into which countries, entire regions, both in Africa and the Middle East, are plunging. And here today, I am calling on the international community to do what needs to be done in Dakar in February 2018 to replenish the global partnership for education that France will co-chair with Senegal. It is a vital battle the we will fight there, it is about enabling young girls and boys not to fall victim to obscurantism, to be able to choose their future, not the future that is forced upon them by need or the one that we choose for them here in this hall.
The second priority is to invest in health, in the fight to eradicate major pandemics and malnutrition, because there is no hope when people cannot be trained or treated. In this fight for development we also need to support the role of women, culture and freedom of expression. Everywhere that the role of women is being challenged, flouted, development is being obstructed, which means the capacity of a society to become emancipated, to occupy its rightful place, is being obstructed; these are not trivial societal issues, it is a deep civilizational fight, it is our fight, they are our values and they are not relative, they are extremely universal on every continent, all over the world. Everywhere that culture is flouted, there again our collective ability to take up these challenges is limited.
That is why UNESCO is today a particularly vital institutions and in this regard has a key role to play, which is to conserve a human face in the world when so much obscurantism seeks to eliminate its incredible diversity. It is so that culture and the language of everyone can live and flourish that we are fighting to see progress of the human mind continue. And freedom of expression is a battle that is also extremely topical. The United Nations is tasked with protecting the freedom of those who think, reflect, express themselves and particularly the freedom of the press. That is why I am calling for the appointment of a special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for the protection of journalists around the world, because under no circumstances can the fight against terrorism, the toughening of the world in which we live, justify the reduction of this freedom.
CLIMATE CHANGE
I would lastly like to speak on behalf of Jules, my fellow French citizen living on the island of St Martin; I am thinking of his destroyed house, of his fear that it will happen over and over again because climate change multiplies disasters. The future of the world is that of

our planet, which is taking its revenge on the folly of men; nature is calling us back into line and is summoning us to take up our duty of humanity and solidarity. Nature will not negotiate, it is up to humanity to defend itself by protecting it. Climate disruptions destroy traditional opposition between the North and the South, the most vulnerable are always the first victims caught up in the whirlwind of injustices, and we are all affected by the terrible runaway climate episodes from China to the Caribbean and from Russia to the Horn of Africa.
My country promised before this Assembly a universal agreement in Paris, which was achieved and signed in this hall. This agreement will not be renegotiated, it unites us, it brings us together; to unravel it would be to destroy a pact that was made not only between states but also between generations. It can be improved with new contributions, but we will not go back. I profoundly respect the decision of the United States and the door will always be open to them, but we will continue with all governments, local governments, cities, companies, NGOs and citizens of the world to implement the Paris Agreement. On our side, we have the strength of pioneers, endurance, certitude and the energy of those who would like to build a better world and, yes, this better world will create innovation, jobs, whether the men and women whose vision of the future is based on looking back like it or not.
We will build it immediately by implementing our contributions, as France has done by adopting its climate plan, which places it on the road to carbon neutrality, by convening in Paris on 12 December all those who have decided to advance on the basis of concrete solutions, by mobilizing public and private financing, and I confirm here that France will do its part by allocating 5 billion a year to climate action from now until 2020. We will increase our ambitions by presenting this afternoon a Global Pact for the Environment whose aim will be to forge international law for the century to come with the support of UN bodies. When some would like to stop, we must continue to move forward, to go further, because climate change is not stopping, because our disruptions are not stopping and because our duty of solidarity and humanity is not stopping.
Ladies and gentlemen, behind each of our decisions there are voices and lives, there is the invisible parade of those we must defend, because one day we were defended ourselves. Why do we not hear these voices more, these voices that call out? Why are we no longer capable of doing what, 70 years ago, restored all mankind's ability to believe in itself, global responsibility, the taste for mutual assistance and faith in progress? And yes, when I talk about Bana, Ousmane, Kouam or Jules, I am speaking about my fellow citizens, your fellow citizens, every single one of them, for our interests and our security are also theirs! We are inextricably bound together in a community of destinies, for today and tomorrow. So global balances have, of course, profoundly changed in recent years. The world has once again become multipolar, meaning that we need to relearn both the complexity of dialogue and its fruitfulness.
LIBYA/VENEZUELA/UKRAINE
Our collective action is confronted with the instability of states, such as in Libya. Six years on now from its armed intervention, before this assembly I hereby accept France's particular responsibility to ensure the country's stability is restored. The meeting at La Celle Saint-Cloud on 25 July enabled progress on the reconciliation which is essential for the success of the political process under the auspices of the United Nations. Alongside the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, we need to achieve, in 2018, the organization of elections that will mark the beginning of an effective restoration of the state,

6
and I'll put all my energy into this. In Venezuela too, collective action needs to uphold respect for democracy and respect for all political forces, and cede no ground to the dictatorial tendencies that are currently at work. And in Ukraine, we need to work tirelessly to enforce the commitments that have been made and enable an effective ceasefire, and gradually, as we are doing with German in particular, enable the parties present to comply with international law and bring an end to this conflict.
NORTH KOREA
Multilateralism is struggling to address the challenges of nuclear proliferation, isn't managing to banish threats that we thought were a thing of the past and that have erupted suddenly once more in our present. Pyongyang, for example, has breached  and assumed  a major threshold in military escalation. The threat concerns us all, immediately, existentially and collectively. To date, North Korea has shown no sign of a will to negotiate. Its leaders have locked themselves into determined one-upmanship, and it is our responsibility, along with all our partners including China and Russia, to firmly bring them back to the table to negotiate a political settlement to the crisis. France will refuse any escalation and will close no door to dialogue, so long as the conditions are there for this dialogue to further peace.
IRAN
That same objective is why I am defending the nuclear agreement with Iran. Our commitment to nuclear non-proliferation enabled us to achieve a solid, robust and verifiable agreement on 14 July 2015, which will enable us to ensure Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons. Terminating it today, without anything to replace it, would be a grave mistake. Not respecting it would be irresponsible, because it is a useful agreement that is essential to peace, at a time when the risk of an infernal spiral cannot be ruled out. That is what I said yesterday to the United States and to Iran.
For my part, I would like us to supplement this agreement with work that will help control Iran's ballistic activities, and to govern the situation after 2025 which is not covered by the 2015 agreement. We need to be more demanding, but we should in no way unpick what previous agreements have secured. Look at the situation we are in today. Have we, through a lack of dialogue, better contained the situation in North Korea? Not for a single second. Wherever there is dialogue and control, multilateralism has powerful weapons and is useful. That is what I want for us all.
MULTILATERALISM
So, I don't know if my distant successor, in 70 years, will have the privilege of speaking before you. Will multilateralism survive the period of doubts and dangers that we are experiencing? In truth, we need to remember the state of the world, 70 years ago, broken by war and stunned by genocides. We need to rediscover today the optimism, ambition and courage that we raised against these reasons to doubt. We need to rediscover faith in what unites us. That means that we need to rediscover confidence in these founding values of the UN, which are universal and protect individuals across the planet, guaranteeing their dignity.
But, ladies and gentlemen, how did this happen? Because we allowed the notion to descend, that multilateralism is, in a way, a comfortable sport, a game for sitting diplomats; that it is the instrument of the weak. That is what has happened over so many years. Because

7
we let ourselves believe that we were more credible, stronger, when we acted unilaterally. But that is wrong. Because we let ourselves believe, sometimes cynically, that not everything could be achieved through multilateralism.
So we let global disruption gain the upper hand. We have dragged our feet on addressing climate change and on tackling today's inequalities that dysfunctional capitalism has begun producing. We have allowed discordant voices to speak out. But it is always the loudest voice that wins at that game, every time. In our complacency, forgetting the lessons of our history, we have allowed the idea that we are stronger outside multilateralism to gain a foothold.
But the challenge today, for our generation, is to rebuild that multilateralism. It is to explain that today, in the current state of the world, there is nothing more effective than multilateralism. Why? Because all our challenges are global, such as terrorism, migration, global warming and regulation of the digital sector. All these issues can only be addressed globally, and multilaterally. Each time we consent to circumvent multilateralism, we hand victory to the law of the strongest.
Because yes, my friends, if we are to enshrine our vision of the world, we can only do that through multilateralism. Because this vision is universal. It is not regional. Because every time we have given in to those who say that the role of women was a matter for the few, in a certain part of the world, but not for others, or that equality between citizens was a matter for one civilization, but not another, we have abandoned what has brought us here together in this place and the universality of these values. There too, in certain countries, we have given in to the law of the strongest.
Because every time the great powers, sitting around the table at the Security Council, have given in to the law of the strongest, to unilateralism, or denounced agreements they had themselves signed, they have not respected the cement of multilateralism: the rule of law. That is what made us, and builds peace over time.
So yes, today more than ever, we need multilateralism. Not because this is a comfortable word, or because it is a sort of refuge for smart people. No, because multilateralism is the rule of law. It is exchange between peoples, the equality between us all. It is what allows us to build peace and address each of the challenges we face.
UN REFORM
So yes, to do this, the United Nations has total legitimacy to act and preserve the world's stability. That is why I want a more accountable, effective and agile UN, and I fully support the UN Secretary-General's plan, his ambition and determination to lead an organization equal to the world's challenges. We need to step out of our offices, of meetings between states and governments, to seek other energies and to represent differently the world as it is, taking a second look at the dogmas in which we sometimes allow ourselves to be trapped.
We need a Security Council capable of making effective decisions and that is not locked up through the veto, when mass atrocities are committed. We need a better representation of all forces present on all continents. We need coordination in the management of crises, with

8
the European Union, the African Union, and sub-regional organizations that are key players. That is why France will be there, alongside the United Nations, for the ongoing reform.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the forgotten voices that I have mentioned today resonate only in a forum like this one: a forum where everyone has their place, where everyone can be heard, even by those who do not want to listen. For the latter, I have a message: not listening to the voices of the oppressed, of victims, means allowing their misfortune to grow and develop until the day it strikes us all. It means forgetting that we have all, at a moment in our history, been the oppressed, and that others have heard our voices. It means forgetting that our security is their security, that their lives affect ours and that we have no chance of coming out unscathed when the world is in flames.
Not listening to those who appeal for our help means believing that we are protected by walls and borders. But it is not our walls that protect us. It is our will to act, and to influence the course of history. It is our refusal to accept that history will be written without us, while we believe we are safe. What protects us is our sovereignty and the sovereign exercise of our strength in support of progress. That is the independence of nations in the context of our interdependence.
Not listening to these voices means believing that their misery is not our own. That we will forever possess the goods that they can only dream of. But when that good is the planet, when it is peace, justice or freedom, do you think we can enjoy it alone, and apart?
If we do not stand up for these common goods, we will all be wiped out. We are allowing fires to break out into which, tomorrow, history will throw our own children.
Yes, today even more than before, our common goods are also our interests and our security, and their security too. There cannot be, on the one hand, the irenicism of those who believe in the rule of law and multilateralism and, on the other, the pragmatism of certain unilateralists. That is false.
Our real effectiveness is at play in this conflict, here. So, with you, I believe today in a strong and responsible multilateralism. That is the responsibility of our generation, if we are not to give in to fatalism. We need only one form of courage, ladies and gentlemen: that of hearing these voices, that of not deviating from the trace we need to leave in history, and that, at all times, of considering that we have to reconcile our interests and values, our security and the planet's common goods. Our generation has no choice, for it has to speak for today and for tomorrow.
Thank you./."
Gambia_(Republic_of_The),"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Your Majesties, Your Excellencies - Heads of State and Government, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,
With warm greetings to you all from the New Gambia, we thank the Almighty God for mak!ng this great gathering of global leaders possible once again this year. Allow me to formally congratulate the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary. General of our organization for their leadership and commitment to the values of the United Nations.
After more than seventy years of existence, the United Nations undoubtedly remains the ultimate international platform for finding solutions to global challenges, as we in The Gambia know all too well. Today, being my maiden appearance at this great forum of world leaders, let me take this opportunity to re-affirm The Gambia's firm commitment to the Charter of the United Nations. My Government fully appreciates the UN's central role in the pursuit of preventive diplomacy to avert crises around the world.
Mr. President,
The recent political crisis that took place in my country created a new democratic beginning and the experience taught us useful lessons that Gambians will not easily forget. We learnt that will power and national unity, decisive regional intervention as well as undivided and clear support of the international community could produce positive outcomes. Also of importance, was the coordinated international action inspired by our common values of solidarity, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of iaw which was critical in sending the right message to the former President to respect the will of the people and leave without bloodshed.
During those difficult times, we knew we had friends, ones who came to our aid and who have since kept faith with us. We therefore would like to seize this great opportunity to thank the leaders of ECOWAS for their timely and firm intervention in bringing peace to The Gambia. We also thank all our regional and international friends who stood by us in our critical hour of need. Thanks to your collective efforts, The Gambia is now on a solid path to peace and good governance and ready to take over our traditional role among the champions of human rights and democracy. Gambians have made an irreversible choice to close a dark chapter in our history and today, our national agenda is one of reform and transformation.
Like any restored democracy, we are facing enormous challenges in the revival of our economy, a comprehensive reform of our laws, our administrative and judicial institutions. The modernization of our security sector, consolidation of the rule of law and human rights are part of our reform programme. It is only by overcoming these challenges that we can reinforce our democratic gains and my Government is committed to delivering a New Gambia that is fit for our children to be proud of.


indeed, young people were all along at the forefront of our democratic transition and addressing youth unemployment, which is a top priority of my government, will no doubt create enormous opportunities. Mr. President,
We also recognize the crucial role of Gambians in the Diaspora in contributing to the transformation of our motherland. Let me seize this opportunity to sincerely thank Our development partners and friends for the invaluable budget and policy support they are providing to the Government to help address the challenges of job creation and youth irregular migration. My Government is committed to using such resources wisely for sustainable socioeconomic development.
Mr. President,
We may be a small country but one witl huge neeT:t: As a matter of urgent Yi6rity, w have developed a New National Development Plan in line with the transformative agenda of the new
Government.
This development blueprint is designed to put the country back on track to economic growth and prosperity following two decades of mismanagement, corruption and widespread human rights violations. This new plan is built on sound macro-economic and fiscal policies that will lead to stability and economic growth over the medium and long term. It has also incorporated the Sustainable Development Goals and other commitments contained in Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
The Paris agreement is critically relevant for The Gambia because climate change means a lot more in our situation. When land productivity declines and water shortage intensifies, young people from rural areas are often sent away to ease the burden on the family and to find new sources of income. This sadly explains why many young Gambians have been forced to make the long and dangerous journey to Europe.
The journey is so risky that many perish at high seas and never reach their final destination. Countless others disappear into immigration detention centers or vanish in the sands of the Sahara desert.
Those who are able to complete the journey are often dismissed as economic migrants and sent back home. This sense of hopelessness and frustration also provides fertile ground for smugglers and extremist groups to recruit innocent youths into the criminal underworld.
Young people do not deserve this experience, they deserve the chance to enjoy a safe and prosperous future, at home. Creating new employment opportunities that provide young people with sustainable incomes and connect them to a revitalized land, healthy and productive environment is an investment in the future of the nation. This is a key priority in our National Development Plan.


Over the last decade, we lost many of our friends and development partners through wrong policy choices, but since therestoration of democracy and good governance, many of our longstanding partners are all coming back to work with us. We are in the process of rejoining the Commonwealth and the International Criminal Court. We are also committed to be part of the African Peer Review Mechanism.
We are finalizing plans for a roundtable donors' conference to mobilize resources for the tongterm development of the country. Your continued support, solidarity and partnership will be. critical to the success of that conference.
Mr. President,
Although the Gambia did not go through armed conflict, the political crisis that we experienced came as a result of decades of bad.governance, weak state institutions, rule of fear, and growing -intoiTa-n. W were on thib bil6f-pdi[tialioqene -affd aTmonli.
We therefore express our deep appreciation to the United Nations Office for West Africa, United Nations Peace Building Commission and the Peace Building Support Office for the initial critical support that they have rendered to my country.
Your continued support in the areas of transitional justice and security sector reform will certainly go a long way towards entrenching peace, justice and democracy in The Gambia.
Mr. President,
There is neither a shortage of ideas nor that of resources to fix the major problems facing the human race. What has always been scarce is the political will and unless adequate resources are invested, the pace of development will remain slow and minimal impact achieved. It is against that backdrop that I am calling on the private sector to emulate philanthropists for their generosity towards the most isolated, marginalized and deprived sections of the world, providing safe drinking water, roads, power, health care and education, key to regaining human dignity.
Mr. President,
The pursuit of peace and security in Africa and the world will always be a major foreign policy goal for The Gambia. We will pursue good neighborliness and cooperat!0n with the sister Republic of Senegal and the countries of ECOWAS will remain strategic partners. West Africa is on the march towards the consolidation of its democratic gains but as a region we are facing serious threats to our peace and security. Terrorism, extremism, religious intolerance, organized crime and drug-trafficking are seriously undermining our development efforts. Recent attacks in Mall, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire and the Sahel in general underscore the urgent need for greater regional and international cooperation in addressing these challenges.
Mr. President,


The indifference, the injustices, and the indignities in isolated parts of the world create real threats to global peace, prosperity and democracy. We need to take bigger and bolder steps to close the gap between the North and South as the world is too imbalanced.
Mr. President,
We remain deeply concerned that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict still defies resoiutibn. My Government firmly subscribes to the idea of a two-state solution; for the two peoples to live side by side in peace and harmony. We therefore call on the UN Secretary-General to vigorously pursue this formula in the interest of lasting peace.
....... Mreident,
In our foreign policy and as part of our historic friendship, we fully recognize the one-China policy. The People's Republic of China is the sole representative of the Chinese people and a true friend of The Gambia. Our two countries continue to strengthen cooperation on the basis of a win-win approach built on mutual trust and respect within the framework of the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation.
Mr. President,
An organization like the United Nations, by virtue of its functions, would always require some level of reform of its management systems. The inter-governmental character of the mandates entrusted to the Secretariat requires the existence of trust and accountability between member states and the Secretariat. As you embark on your proposed reforms, we stand ready to give you our full support in the interest of an effective and more relevant world body.
Lastly but not the least, one of the long-standing issues is the pending question of Security Council reform. Former Secretary-General Kofi Annan once said that ""No reform of the United Nations is complete without reform of the Security Council"". That remains true today.
Africa will not give up its legitimate and historic quest for true representation on the Council and The Gambia fully supports the African Union's demand for the long overdue reform of the Security Council.
Mr. President,
I want to conclude by reaffirming my optimism and confidence in our collective ability to uplift mankind from the clutches of poverty; to institute a global order of peace, firmly held together by justice; loving, caring and tolerating each other. In tune with our National Anthem, we pledge our firm allegiance to these values we hold ever true.

With best wishes from the people of The Gambia - The Smiling Coast of Africa, I wish you all a successful 72""a Session of the United Nations General Assembly. God bless the world, thank you."
Georgia,"President, Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the outset let me express my deepest condolences and sympathy to the victims of the natural disasters that have occurred in recent days in North America --
hurricanes that have devastated Caribbean island
nations and parts of the United States - and earthquakes that have hit Mexico. We convey our solidarity to the governments of these nations during these difficult times. No country, including Georgia, is immune from natural disasters. Solidarity is what strengthens nations addressing these severe challenges.
Excellences,
My fellow countrymen share with me the honor of addressing you today, because the message that I am entrusted to deliver is one they understand in their

bones, having personally experienced it, lived it, and
embraced it.
That message--^their message--is straightforward: By putting the Georgian citizens at the center of our strategy, we aim to strengthen further democratic institutions, ensure peace and accelerate economic growth. These are the essential multipliers for sustainable development, which connects us with the region and the world.
This year marks the 25th anniversary of Georgia's membership in the United Nations. Over this period, we managed to transform our country from a UN humanitarian aid recipient to a top reformer that recently was elected as the Chair of the Open Government Partnership.
Georgia brings to this task the same vision we embrace

for ourselves; putting our citizens at the center.
Georgia's chairmanship of the Open Government Partnership will support the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 16: To promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build
effective, accountable and inclusive institutions.
While implementing the SDGs through translating them into the national policies, we see the need of institutional reform of the UN and support the new vision of the Secretary-General Guterres reflected in the declaration we subscribed recently.
When I addressed you last year, Georgia was in the lead-up to a general election. This resulted in our people entrusting us with increased support to lead the country.

The people saw two things. First, that we are committed to making democratic rights and security the key drivers of all our policies. Second, they saw that we offer a clear path for further reforms.
Our citizens feel what international institutions state
clearly. Georgia has advanced in all international rankings in the past five years.
We have come to grips with corruption. The Heritage Foundation ranks Georgia 31st in 2017 in terms of freedom from corruption, an improvement of 38 positions from 2012. (Transparency International
reflected this progress in 2016, placing Georgia 44*""^
among 176 countries.)
We have prioritized the protection of property rights. The
World Economic Forum's 2016-2017 Global

Competitiveness Report elevated Georgia by 77 positions since 2012 and now we are ranked as 43rd among the world's 138 economies.
We are committed to an independent judiciary. The
World Economic Forum ranks Georgia at 63""^^ in this regard, up by 28 positions from 91'.
And in the critical area of law enforcement and physical
security, the World Bank ranks Georgia 26""' with respect to the fight against organized crime, up from 67'""
position by 41 steps.
We are not making cosmetic changes. We promised our people that we would introduce a parliamentary system and improve our constitution to conform to the best European standards. In addition to addressing numerous contradictions in the current constitution, the new draft introduces many new progressive initiatives.

such as the right to physical Integrity, the rights of disabled persons, the right to access to the Internet, environmental protections, and many more that are In
line with the recommendations of the Venice
Commission. These commitments reflect Georgians' aspirations to attain full membership In the European Union and NATO. Georgians understand this to be their destiny, as Georgia has long been an Integral part of Europe's broad cultural and historical tapestry.
In parallel with Constitutional reform, we began Implementing our four-point reform plan, to ensure quick economic growth.
We launched an ambitious education reform to facilitate
links between the educational system and Industry, to develop demand based higher and professional education and enhance the economic skills and capacity
of the labor force.

Having an innovative society is a key to success for our talented young people. We are investing further in our national ecosystem and integrating it into the global one to open doors and build bridges for our innovators to
world markets.
Prudent macro-economic policy has been the foundation of our success in the region's turbulent economic
environment. The World Economic Forum's Global
Competitiveness Report now ranks Georgia at 40**^ in
the world, a gain of 97 spots since 2012. This month, Moody's upgraded the sovereign credit rating of Georgia to Ba2, acknowledging that Georgia has successfully overcome the regional shock of 2014-2016.
To increase incentives to invest in Georgia, we have implemented a bold taxation reform, which includes abolishing the profit tax on undistributed earnings and liberalizing the tax administration system. We anticipate

up to 5% economic growth this year, rising to 7% and higher in the coming years.
We are committed to upgrading Georgia's infrastructure. This is important for Georgia to realize its geostrategic aim to serve as a hub for doing business in the region, connecting East and West. Upgrading infrastructure is essential to ensure the rapid delivery of services, achieve efficiency in tourism and logistics, and effectively take goods to market. We see this as a powerful way to create employment that pulls people out of poverty. We have agreed to a multi-year program with the IMF and secured financing for projects worth several billion dollars from international financial organizations.
Georgia - together with Ukraine and Moldova - has signed an Association Agreement with Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area and achieved visa-free travel to the EU. At the same time, Georgia has become the first country in the region to sign a Free

Trade Agreement with China. On the one hand, we are integrating into the EU internal market and, on the other hand, we are bringing Asian markets closer to us. This enables Georgia to use the full potential of its free trade networks as part of one of the most exciting development ventures of our time.
We are contributing to the One Belt One Road project, whjch will facilitate trade in high-value goods and services between Europe and Asia, carving significant time from traditional seaborne transport around the peripheries of Eurasia.
Asia and Europe will meet in this grand adventure through the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project, which we are implementing together with our Turkish and Azerbaijani partners, and Georgia's new state-of-the-art port on the Black Sea at Anaklia. This deep water port will be capable of handling the largest container ships, which will result in a multifold increase of Georgia's

cargo transit capacity. Anaklia will be developed by multiple international players and will be operated by a renowned American company.
Georgia is now less than 10 days from East Asia and within five days of any point in Europe. We are creating efficient multimodal transit infrastructure which will forge links and processes, and will cement relationships among states and people from Europe to Asia. It
represents the fundamental connection between
building economic stability for Georgians and achieving a more prosperous and peaceful region.
In a world full of challenges - hot and frozen conflicts, state and non-state aggressions - Georgia is no exception. And here, too, we put our citizens at the center of our strategy. UN members are well aware that the Russian Federation continues to occupy two historic regions of Georgia's sovereign territory in violation of its many international obligations, including dozens of

Security Council and UNGA resolutions.
Since the beginning of 2017, the Russian Federation has intensified its policy of occupation and factual annexation of Georgian regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali/South Ossetia. It has implemented so-called ""integration treaties"" and signed so-called ""agreements"" with de-facto authorities to absorb Georgia's occupied regions into Russia's military, political, economic and social systems and accelerated its military build-up in both occupied regions of Georgia. The Russian
Federation has intensified the fortification of the
occupation lines by installing razor wire fences, trenches, so-called ""border signs,"" and other artificial barriers. Families have even suffered razor wires cutting through their dwellings or farmyards.
Vulnerable groups, such as people in need of medical care and schoolchildren crossing to get an education in their native language, prohibited in the occupied

regions, have been blocked by closed crossing points.
Meanwhile Russia continues to install motion detectors
and other technologies to assert full control of all crossings along the occupation line.
Georgia is firmly committed to the peaceful resolution of the Russia-Georgia conflict. The Georgian Government complies with the EU mediated Ceasefire Agreement. It
has many times reaffirmed its adherence to legally binding non-use offeree. Russia has not reciprocated.
Georgia's consistent efforts to find a peaceful solution to
this conflict are reflected in the testimonies of many
countries and international organizations. I would like to thank world leaders for addressing the need of
accelerating peaceful conflict resolution and supporting Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty during this
General debate.

Every year the UN General Assembly adopts a resolution reiterating the right of return of all internally displaced persons and refugees to the occupied
regions. Georgians are grateful for the United Nations'
support, but this has not translated into reality for hundreds of thousands of my compatriots waiting to
return to their homes simply because one UN member
state refuses to comply with its international obligations.
The Government of Georgia is providing new instruments to rebuild trust with our compatriots living
across the occupation line. We are determined to make the benefits of Georgia's European agenda available to the people on the other side of occupation line. Our substantial package of initiatives for those under occupation include providing opportunities for
across-Administrative Border Line trade and access to
Georgia's free trade opportunities in the global
marketplace. We offer them healthcare, education, and
other social benefits.

Despite our own challenges, Georgia is a significant contributor to Euro-Atlantic security. Our strategic partnership with the United States has proved to be key for our development and stability and we are committed
to deepening our ties further. The EU in its Global Strategy has recognized Georgia's success as prosperous, peaceful and stable democracy, significant contributor in its neighborhood.
We continue our active participation in international operations, including in Afghanistan and in the European crisis management operations in the Central African Republic and Mali.
In 2014, Georgia became a member of Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and joined three counter-ISIS working groups on counter-financing, counter-messaging and foreign terrorist fighters; Georgia is a party to 14 UN antiterrorism conventions, as well as to the European

Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, and fulfills
its commitments in this regard.
Georgia is growing. Georgia is vibrant. Georgia is
resilient in the face of challenges. Georgia carries its
share of responsibility. Georgia is all of these things,
because Georgia is its citizens. They are the center of
our Government's strategy, and this is where they will
remain.
As we have reached for the world, the world has come
to us. Our citizens are the beneficiaries of greater
connectivity to the world. Their economic success is a
prerequisite for sustained well-being and prosperity both at home and well beyond Georgia's borders. I speak
today as one steward of our nation, with thanks to all who love and support Georgia. I thank you."
Germany,"Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen,
We seem to be confronted with a phase of political hurricanes and earthquakes. And the tone of the confrontations seems to get harsher, more intransigent and belligerent from day to day and from speech to speech.
As responsible politicians, it Is vital that we ask ourselves: How can we bring about a change in direction? A change of direction which will bring about more peace, more stability, less hunger and poverty and better prospects for everyone in the world.
How do we ensure that globalization finally delivers justice for all, not riches to the
few?
One answer as to how we achieve this change in direction can be found in a report to the United Nations Secretary-General. It states: We must not limit ourselves to the ""traditional questions of peace and war,"" but must also work towards overcoming ""world hunger, mass misery and alarming disparities between the living conditions of rich and poor."" I find this analysis very apt. However, the bitter thing about this quote is that it comes from a report to the UN Secretary-General which is forty years old. This apt analysis of the global situation can be found in a report commissioned for the United Nations almost forty years ago to the day.
It was in the report of the International North-South Commission, which began its work forty years ago in 1977. The Chairman of the Commission was the former German Chancellor Willy Brandt.

Essentially, humanity is still faced with more or less the same structural difficulties today - but it seems to have become rather more difficult to change the world for the
better.
Looking around the world today, it seems that a world view which puts one's own national interests first and is no longer engaged in a balancing of interests between the nations and countries of this world is gaining ever more ground. National egoism is worthless as a regulatory principle for our world! For this world view describes the world as an arena, a kind of battleground, in which everyone is fighting against everyone else and in which everyone has to assert their own interests, either alone or in alliances of convenience. In this world view, the law of the strongest prevails, not the strength of the law.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that we have to rise against this world view. We need more international cooperation and less national egoism, not the other way round. Some forty years ago, the North-South Commission recognized that global problems cannot be resolved through confrontation but only through often arduous efforts to identify common interests. Ultimately, no country, no nation will gain if it only strives to assert its own interests. For if everyone were to do that, confrontations and conflicts would increase rather than prosperity.
The motto ""Our country first"" not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity. In the end, there will only be losers.
Our historical experience as Germans is very different: only after we learned following two terrible world wars to see our former enemies as neighbors and partners with whom we want to shoulder responsibility for a peaceful coexistence, only since then, do our own citizens in Germany have a better life.

We have learned that it was not ""Germany first"" that made our country strong and prosperous. Rather, it was only ""European and international responsibility first"" that gave us Germans peace and prosperity.
In international cooperation, no-one loses sovereignty. Rather we all gain new sovereignty which we could no longer have as nation-states on our own in today's
world.
That is why the European Union today provides the framework for our German policies. The road was often stony and arduous. For nothing is more difficult than turning former enemies into friends. Often the road is not popular and one needs considerable political courage. For the call for international cooperation and for efforts to balance interests is not always popular in one's own country. However, this courage has finally created peace in Europe after centuries of war. We Germans are grateful today to the courageous people in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and other countries in Europe for showing the courage after the Second World War to make us - their former enemies - new and lasting friends.
It is precisely due to this experience in Germany and Europe, that we are calling for strong and functioning joint institutions, first and foremost the United Nations.
Ladies and gentlemen. How urgently essential it is that we work together to create a safer world is demonstrated by the current irresponsible actions of North Korea, which pose a serious threat to world peace. We have to send a clear message: the international community will not accept North Korea's nuclear provocations. Germany welcomes the sanctions adopted by the Security Council and is calling for their swift implementation at European level.

At the same time, we have to make use of all diplomatic means at our disposal, first of all to defuse the situation and subsequently to find a point of departure for long-
term solutions.
The settlement of this international crisis is so important because otherwise others
will be encouraged to copy North Korea. If a country manages to build up a nuclear
arsenal while the international community stands by and watches helplessly, then other political leaders will follow this example.
This will result in completely new nuclear trouble spots in the world, and our children
and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world. That is why North Korea acquiring nuclear weapons is neither a bilateral nor a regional problem. Rather it is a
global challenge which we have to master together. It cannot be that striving to build up a nuclear arsenal leads to success on the
international stage.
It is therefore more important than ever that the international architecture for arms
control and disarmament does not crumble. Existing treaties and agreements must
not be called into question.
That applies in particular to the agreement on Iran's nuclear program.
The agreement is a way out of the impasse of a nuclear confrontation which would jeopardize regional security and have an impact far beyond the region. But only if all obligations are rigorously adhered to and the agreed transparency is
created, can the urgently needed confidence grow.
Germany will work within the E3+3 framework to ensure that the agreement is strictly
implemented and upheld.
This is not only about Iran. This is about the credibility of the international community.
For which state would refrain from developing its own nuclear program if it turns out that negotiated agreements do not endure and confidence in agreements with the international community are not worth the paper they are written on?

Ladies and gentlemen,
What the world needs most urgently Is new trust. Especially with regard to the
implementation of the ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we have a request
for the United States, Russia and China. These countries will be Instrumental in
ensuring that the ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as arms control
and disarmament are implemented. To this end, the trust among them must be
restored.
Ladles and gentlemen,
Speeches by the Presidents of the United States are always important and interesting. It is always worthwhile listening to them or even reading them. I found a
quote in one of these speeches which I especially liked. In this speech, the American President called for ""general and complete
disarmament"".
Every year, he said in his speech, billions of dollars were spent on weapons that are
""acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them"", this, he went
on to say, was certainly not ""the most efficient means of assuring peace"".
The speech was given by John F. Kennedy in 1963.
You can see, everything we need for a safer future has already been thought, written
and said.
I believe we should focus today on the bold visions of the North-South Commission and that ofJohn F. Kennedy and have the courage to put forward new offers on
disarmament, arms control and confidence-building.

Ladies and gentlemen, One of our tasks is to resolve emerging crises early on.
One recent example of this is the escalation of violence against the Rohingyas and the flows of refugees in the region. We have to act as quickly as possible here- in the form of both political and humanitarian support - in order to alleviate the suffering and end the conflict. Germany will again increase its aid for the Rohingyas via the
International Red Cross.
Germany is committed to providing political and humanitarian support, as well as to practical peace-building, in many crisis regions around the world. Military engagement under the auspices of the United Nations is also sometimes necessary. However, we have to make sure that we do not create an imbalance.
The report of the North-South Commission included an impressive finding: the military expenditure of only half a day would have sufficed to finance the whole
malaria eradication program at that time. These days, I suspect that not even half a day would be necessary. We currently spend just under 1.7 trillion US dollars each year on arms around the world. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations, i.e. to eradicate extreme poverty in the world by 2030, we would need only
10 percent of that.
We Germans have therefore tripled our funding for civilian peace building measures during the last few years.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thankfully, progress has also been made. For example, in Iraq. We have to quickly consolidate the successes which have been achieved there in the fight against the

so-called Islamic State by Initiating reconstruction and stabilization measures in the
liberated cities and regions.
Germany has therefore decided to make available an additional 250 million euros for
the reconstruction of Mosul. For we cannot abandon the victims of the IS thugs! It is also important to strengthen a democratic and inclusive Iraqi state - and to ensure that the actions of an individual region do not leave it exposed to a renewed threat of destabilization. We can only ask the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq not to trigger any new conflicts. New conflicts are the very last thing that this country needs.
Ladies and gentlemen, We also have to make progress in the Ukraine conflict. The Minsk agreements provide a clear road map for peace, in the elaboration of which Germany played a key role. It is based on the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the inviolability
of borders.
If proposals are now put forward on deploying a UN peace mission, then I think we should pursue this idea resolutely. Certainly there is not yet sufficient consensus on what this peace mission should look like. However, it is worth the effort to try this idea out and we ask the UN Secretary-General to press for this proposal to be realized.
Ladies and gentlemen. The North-South Commission pointed out that focusing solely on questions of war and peace is not enough. Rather, these issues are inextricably linked to the fair distribution of resources, to economic and social development and to respect for universal human rights.
Only a world in which solidarity prevails will ultimately bring us security and stability. Agenda 2030 shows that the international community has identified this as a
""common interest"".

Ladies and gentlemen,
If we want to realize major ambitions such as peace, security and justice, we need
strong joint Institutions, particularly the United Nations.
The founders of the United Nations were not naive - they had experienced the
horrors of the first half of the 20""^ century.
For that very reason, they bequeathed to us the UN Charter with Its timeless
principles and maxims.
However, ladies and gentlemen,
Although the principles of the United Nations are not outdated, the world organization
has to adapt to the challenges of our time.
We therefore support the Secretary-General's efforts to push ahead with bold reforms
within the United Nations. He has set the right priorities.
How well the reform of the United Nations succeeds is largely up to us, the member
states.
We have to work together to give the United Nations more clout and more efficiency. In my view, the reform efforts should not focus primarily on cutbacks.
On the contrary, the United Nations will probably need more funding. We have to provide the United Nations with the means it needs to fulfill its mandate.
At present, however, the figures tell a different story:
The World Food Program receives less than 50% of the funding needed tO
combat the world's hunger crises today.

The United Nations Development Program receives a mere 15% of its
contributions as voluntary, non-tied payments today, in 2011 it was still 50 h. And
things do not look any better with respect to other UN aid programs.
It cannot be that those in positions of responsibility at the United Nations spend more
time distributing begging letters to find the necessary funding than in organizing
effective assistance.
We have to change course here. We have to grant the United Nations more freedom,
in exchange for greater transparency on the use of funds.
Germany, at any rate, intends to maintain its financial support for the United Nations.
As the fourth biggest provider of assessed contributions and far beyond that, for
example as one of the biggest donors of humanitarian assistance around the world,
our input is substantial.
1believe that we as member states should now adopt a further reform project which
is long overdue:
the composition of the Security Council should reflect the realities of today's world.
For today, more states than at the time of the establishment of the United Nations over 70 years ago are shouldering responsibility for peace and security - and are
prepared to live up to this responsibility in the United Nations.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Germany is ready and willing to shoulder additional responsibility. That is why Germany is seeking a non-permanent seat on the United Nations
Security Council for the 2019-2020 term. We do so with a clear compass - peace and security, global justice and human rights
are indivisibly linked.
We intend to work in partnership with all members of the United Nations - In Africa
Asia, America and Europe.
For we can only resolve the global problems if we reach a fair and peaceful balance
of interests among all nations.

Yes, this is an arduous process. However, we have to muster up the courage to down this path. For, as Willy Brandt, who headed the North-South Commission after leaving office as Chancellor, once said: We firmly believe ""that problems created by men can also be solved by men"". Let us work on this together! Thank you very much!"
Ghana,"President of the General Assembly, Secretary General, Your Excellencies,
It has been sixty years since my country, Ghana, became a member of this Organisation. We joined at our independence some twelve years after the first meeting of the Organisation in San Francisco, and Ghana has been an active participant in the United Nations since then.
I want, Mr President, to thank the United Nations for the honour done Ghana by my appointment, by the Secretary General, as co-Chair of the Group of Advocates of Eminent Persons of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, to continue in the position that was held by my predecessor as President, His Excellency John Dramani Mahama. This mark of trust in Ghana's leaders is a matter of justifiable pride for the Ghanaian people, a trust I pledge to uphold.
On 25th September, 2015, when the SDGs were adopted, there were sceptics who feared that the goals were too many and too complex to be successfully tackled, even with concerted effort.
The lesson that we have learnt, however, from the experience of this Organisation is that, once the world puts its collective mind to something, the chances are we would get it right.
And, every day, something happens to bring home to us, the inhabitants of this planet, that we are in it together. There is no better dramatic indication of this truth than the images that recently dominated our television screens of devastation caused by floods in Houston Texas, in Dhaka Bangladesh, in Numbai India, in Palpa Nepal, in Dominica, Puerto Rico, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Nartin, all in the Caribbean, and in Niamey Niger.
One of the most modern cities in the richest, most powerful nation on our earth, was suffering the same fate as Niamey in the Sahel region of Africa,

one of the poorest parts of the world. At the height of the raging waters, one thing became clear: it did not matter if you were in the richest or poorest part of the world, the awesome power of nature was on display, and we, humans, came across as the same sad creatures at the mercy of
nature.
As T watched and listened, along with the rest of the world, it occurred to me that, all put together, the SDGs are, indeed, a worthwhile set of goals for the world. They bear repeating: no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, life below water, life on land, peace, justice and strong institutions and topped up with partnerships for the goals. We should work hard to achieve these goals. The world will be a much better place.
Ghana was the first country in sub-,Saharan Africa to gain her freedom from colonial rule. This year marks the 60th anniversary of that independence, and it is auspicious that I am addressing this Assembly for the first time on the birth date of our historic first President, Kwame Nkrumah, a day we have set aside to commemorate him.
We believe it is time Africa comes of age and holds its rightful place on the world stage. This Africa will be neither a victim nor a pawn. This Africa will be honest to itself and to the world, and this Africa will shed its cloak of
poverty, and become prosperous.
We are not under any illusions about the hard work that it will take to achieve our stated goals, but we are not afraid of hard work. We know that a critical ingredient in making sustainable economic progress is to ensure a stable democratic system of governance,
I believe we are making this progress in Ghana. After years of political turmoil and the accompanying economic chaos, a consensus has emerged in our Fourth Republic. We have had political stability for the last 25 years under a multi-party democracy, where regular elections are now an accepted feature of our governance.

I am here, today, because of elections last December in which the people of Ghana voted out an incumbent government, and gave me and my party the mandate and honour to govern our nation for the next four years. We continue to be a beacon of democracy and stability on the continent, our institutions of state are growing stronger, and we have made more progress with our economy than at any time since independence.
Mr President, we are nowhere near where we want to be, but we are determined to realise our potential and make Ghana a prosperous nation.
There will always be adventurers amongst us Ghanaians who would want to seek challenges in different parts of the world, and we would wish them well, and expect that wherever they go, they would be welcome and treated with dignity.
But we are working to grow our economy and open up opportunities for all our citizens. No longer should Ghanaians feel they have to subject themselves to the intolerable-and inhumane conditions of crossing the Sahara, and drowning in the Mediterranean, in the hope of making a living in Europe.
We have just started the Free Senior High School programme, which aims to guarantee secondary education for all of Ghana's children. The programme will ensure that all our children will be educated to at least secondary level, and money, or the lack of it, will no longer mean a denial of education. This has already led to an increase of over 90,000 children, who have entered secondary school this academic year, who would otherwise have dropped out at this stage. SDG 4, which aims at ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, will be within our reach by the target date.
We do not want to be a scar on anybody's conscience. We want to build an economy that is not dependent on charity and handouts. Long and bitter experience has taught us no matter how generous the charity, we would
remain poor.
We want to build a Ghana which looks to the use of its own resources and their proper management as the way to engineer social and economic

growth in our country. We want to build an economy that looks past commodities to position our country in the global marketplace.
We are not disclaiming aid, but we do want to discard a mind-set of dependency and living on handouts; we want to build a Ghana beyond aid. It is an easier platform on which to build sustainable relationships.
Tn talking about sustainable relations, Africa, and, indeed, Ghana, remains committed to remaining a nuclear weapon-free continent. Three weeks ago, highly-enriched uranium was flown out of Ghana back to China, signalling the end of the removal of all such material from the country. Our nuclear reactor has, subsequently, been converted to use low-enriched fuel for power generation. A world, free of nuclear weapons, must be in all our collective interest.
Mr. President, :[ wish to reaffirm my country's commitment to maintaining friendly and cordial relations with all the countries and peoples of the world. The full engagement of Ghana-, through the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), .in the process of West African integration, and through the African Union (AU), of African integration remains a goal of my government. Regional and continental integration are in Ghana's interest, as they represent one of the surest ways towards establishing the conditions for prosperity on the continent in the decades ahead, as well as helping to ensure security and combating the scourges of terrorism, extremism and intolerance. The conflicts that continue to plague our continent in Libya, South Sudan, Congo DRC, and Mali, would be more effectively resolved if the international community was to support, not undermine, the efforts of our regional and continental organisations to deal with them. Ghana will also continue to be active in the multilateral organisations to which we belong, such as La Francophonie, the Commonwealth of Nations, and this United Nations, because we believe multilateral action and international co-operation are in the interest of all of
US.
We want to build a Ghana that will enable our people deal with the rest of the world on an equal basis. I say nothing new, when I draw attention to the urgent need to reform this Organisation.

:It has been talked about and scheduled for a long time, but, somehow, we have never found the courage and the will to reform the United Nations. Ghana supports the process of UN Reform, especially of the UN Security Council, as set out in Africa's Common Position on UN Reform, based on the Ezulwini Consensus. The time is long overdue to correct the longstanding injustice that the current structure and composition of the UN Security Council represent for the nations of Africa.
We cannot continue to preach democracy and fairness around the world, we cannot insist on peace and justice around the world, when our global organisation is not seen by the majority of its members as having a structure that is just and fair. It is, indeed, seen by many as helping to perpetuate an unfair world order.
This Organisation provides the best vehicle for the world to manage its many varied problems, and we would undermine its credibility and fail in our duty if we do not reform the United Nations. We dare not let ourselves and future generations down. The time for reform has come.
I thank you very much for your attention."
Greece,"Mr President, Mr Secretary General, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr President,
I would like first of all to wish every success to the new Secretary General Mr Guterres and to reaffirm our full support to his work.
Allow me also to congratulate you on both your election to the office of President of this 72nd General Assembly and the choice of this year's main topic.
Our world is changing rapidly today. We are going through the second machine era. An era when machines no longer constitute the extension of physical strength, but rather produce spiritual wealth and knowledge. Machines that are faster and smaller, yet have an immense impact on our daily lives. On the way we work and produce, On the way we communicate and interact. This trend can be described as the fourth industrial revolution.
This new era brings with it innovations and advantages, but also challenges, especially for states. Challenges that they need to face effectively if they are to survive in today's complex international reality.
States have to show resilience and meet the needs of their people for more human rights, communication, growth and innovation.
They have to evolve. But their evolution is certaintly linked to the evolution of the Organization itself. Will the UN be able to follow these developments and adapt to the new emerging reality?
In the light of this double adaptation, this time is extremely critical and requires the promotion of reforms that will make the UN capable of remaining relevant in an ever changing world, one that is very different from the one that existed in 1945.
If the UN is to keep its capacity to uphold its mandate, it also needs to evolve and meet the challenges before us.
As insecurity and instabilitystill abound in large parts of our world, Greece is formulating a multidimensional foreign policy with a view to actively contributing to peace through putting forward concrete ideas at international fora and regional organizations, stability through political initiatives.
More specifically, we favor the prospect of broadening the agenda of the EU-UN institutionalized dialogue and cooperation to an extensive array of issues of global
concern.
As a vision, we all want to see a world free of Weapons of Mass Destruction. In this framework, we strongly condemn this latest test and North Korea's ongoing illegal nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes which seriously endanger regional and international peace and security.

Contemplating developments in disarmament and non-proliferation over the past year, I believe that it is imperative, now morethan ever, to seek avenues of dialogue with the participation of nuclear states. This could be the vehicle to bridge the. gap between the step-by-step approach towards nuclear disarmament and the immediate non-verifiable total ban.
Mr President, Situated close to what continues to be an extremely turbulent region like the Middle East and parts of North Africa, Greece is a pillar of stability.
In this context, we have recently undertaken many initiatives, such as the Rhodes Conference for Security and Stability and the Athens Conference on Religious and Cultural Pluralism and Peaceful Co-existence in the Middle East, as well as the newly established Ancient Civilizations Forum (ACForum), which was held the last time only yesterday, here in New York.
The Rhodes Conference focuses on a positive agenda of cooperation between 20 European and Arab countries of the Eastern Mediterranean, with the aim of fostering stability and security in the region.
I would also like to mention that alongside Cyprus, in the framework of promoting peace and stability in the region of the Eastern Mediterranean, we have established a number of trilateral forms of cooperation which include Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine.
Our main objective is to develop a positive, manifold agenda of cooperation in international affairs, focusing on synergies and joint activities, especially through culture as one of the main drivers of soft power in international relations, and other areas of cooperation, such as trade, education and research.
Enhancing regional cooperation in the Balkans is the core thinking behind another Greek initiative, namely that of Quadrilateral meetings between Ministers of Greece, Albania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, launched in Thessaloniki in April 2016.
The four countries, with a view to responding to the refugee crisis effectively and in line with European democratic values and principles, will focus, during their upcoming meeting in October, on identifying ways for better interaction on issues such as return operations, exchange of information, tackling smuggling, human trafficking, terrorism, organized crime and energy networks.
Mr President,

The Syrian war has taken a great toll in human lives, and millions have been displaced. The.cessation of hostilities is sine qua non for progress of political negotiations. Greece sees no alternative other than a political solution to this crisis. We fully support an inclusive political dialogue in Geneva under UN auspices.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a constant threat to regional stability and security. The current situation on the ground is not sustainable. We support the two-State solution, meaning the creation of a sovereign and independent State of Palestine living in peace and security alongside the State of Israel while responding to Israel's longstanding quest for security.
On Libya, Greece attaches particular importance to the international efforts to stabilize the country, Greece strongly believes that there is no military solution to the Libyan crisis. We support all efforts towards peace and security.
Mr President,
Terrorism remains one of the major global challenges we are faced with, The significant progress witnessed recently in the fight against DAESH demands special mention.
Strengthening international cooperation among all relevant actors and improving information exchange constitute key elements in tackling the movement of foreign fighters, while at the same time it is essential to address the root causes of violent extremism.
Greece participates actively in the common anti-terrorism fight.
In the context of our efforts to prevent terrorists from exploiting any resources for their actions, we particularly support international efforts aiming at promoting a concerted international action against illegal trade of antiquities and cultural artifacts.
Mr. President,
We consistently pursue friendly relations and enhanced cooperation with all our neighboring States as a means of promoting stability and prosperity for all.
In the Western Balkans, Greece remains a firm supporter of the EU Enlargement Policy.
The rise of nationalistic rhetoric in the region raises grave concerns. We wish to underline that actions and statements that undermine good neighborly relations should be avoided by all means.
Greece maintains a friendly approach to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,

........ i .......
The Greek initiative for designing and implementing the bilateral Confidence Building Measures has strengthened our relations, facilitating efforts for addressing more sensitive matters, such as the pending issue of the name of our neighboring country.
In this respect, Greece will continue to work systematically to reach a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue. Our position is clear: a mutually accepted name, erga omnes.
Accordingly, progress in Greek-Turkish relations can only be built upon the full respect of international taw, including the International Law of the Sea. We have repeatedly pointed out that good neighborly relations cannot be served by persistent challenging of Greece's sovereignty and sovereign rights by a neighbor.
Regarding the Cyprus Issue, our objective is summed up in a concept that the UN Secretary General adopted during the International Conference on Cyprus: to make Cyprus a ""normal state"". A sovereign and independent state, free of foreign occupation troops, external guarantees and intervention ""rights"".
The International Conference on Cyprus held in Switzerland this year, was unfortunately closed last July, without producing agreement, because the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot sides were the only parties in the Conference who did not share the goal of the ""normal state"" concept.
We are prepared to continue discussing the key international issue of Security and Guarantees, whenever Turkey demonstrates a clear willingness to resume negotiations on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions, as well as within the framework of parameters set down by the UN Secretary General in Crans Montana.
Mr President,
In the area of civil and political rights, we actively support the fight against racism and any other forms of discrimination including those based on religious, gender, sexual and any other grounds. In this vein, Greece, prioritizing the safety of journalists and media workers, especially in conflict areas, is going to submit the relevant thematic resolution during the current Third Committee session of the UN General Assembly.
Furthermore, my Country in the framework of Human Rights Council leads an initiative by successfully submitting a resolution on ""Promoting Human Rights through sport and the Olympic Ideal"".
We remain committed to the protection of human rights in all policies addressing large movements of migrants, with particular attention paid to the specific needs of migrants in vulnerable situations, including children.
We also believe that setting this framework right is more than ever important in order to grant protection to those in need of it, to fight against human trafficking and migrant

smuggling and to return people not entitled to international protection, while at the same time tackling the root causes of migration through effective cooperation with countries of origin and transit. Finally, social and economic inclusion of legal migrants is equally important and deserves our fullest attention.
Greece has reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring full and effective implementation of the Political Declaration of New York and its annexes, which were adopted during the High Level Meeting on the margins of the 71st UN General Assembly, and, in parallel, it has stressed its commitment to work in the context of the Global Compact for Migration that is to be concluded by 2018.
Mr President,
I wish to assure you that, as a founding member of this Organization, Greece will lend it its unfaifing support as the UN tries to rise up to the task of creating a more peaceful and prosperous future with justice and solidarity for all and especially for the next generations.
Thank you,"
Grenada,"Mr. President, Distinguished Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen
I bring warmest greetings from Grenada's Prime Minister, Dr. The Rt Honourable Keith C. Mitchell.
Mr. President, Prime Minister Mitchell believes in the work of the General Assembly and is only absent because he believes that as Chair of CARICOM his presence in the region allows his colleague prime ministers to travel to New York to plead the cases of their hurricane-stricken
countries..
Our hearts and prayers go out to all the victims in our Caribbean region, Mexico and across the world, who are presently suffering adverse effects of climate change and natural disasters. Within the last few weeks, our fellow OECS and Caribbean Small Island Developing States of Barbuda and the Commonwealth of Dominica were ravaged by hurricanes Irma and Maria causing near total destruction and the loss of many lives. Our hearts also go out to the people of Cuba, with whom our region shares a special bond of friendship.
Mr. President, permit me to implore the international community to recognize, without delay, our responsibility to assist all those affected by natural disasters.

Mr. President, I join those before me in congratulating you on your election as president of this august international body. I am confident in your stewardship and assure you of my delegation's Cooperation and support.
Mr. President, I also take this opportunity to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his able stewardship of the 71st General Assembly.
I also wish to thank both you and Secretary-General Guterres for your leadership and willingness to serve as guardians of the spirit of our UN Charter. Mr. President, I believe there is value in repeating your astute and entirely relevant observation that the UN Charter makes only 5 references
to ""war"", while ""peace"" was referenced 47 times.
Mr. President, over the next few minutes, ! will offer Grenada's interpretation of what it means to ""Strive for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"".
Mr. President, allow me to say a few words on Climate Change. Certainly, based on recent activities in the Atlantic, we just cannot dispute that the climate is changing. In fact, 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.

For those that question the veracity of this science, the cluster of 'extreme' weather events over the last few weeks ought to suffice in sounding the
alarm.
Mr. President, extreme weather events disproportionately affect our planet's most vulnerable. Grenada therefore advocates for special attention to be paid to our women, children, elderly and disabled.
As we assess the physical damage caused by these disasters, let us never overlook the psychological toll on survivors.
Mr. President, we reiterate Grenada's commitment to the Paris Agreement. Speaking in his capacity as Chair of the World Bank's Small States Forum in June of this year, Grenada's Prime Minister lamented the withdrawal of key partners from this agreement. We do not know these partners to be unreasonable and, therefore, we encourage them to see their own selfinterest within the framework of a successful Paris Agreement.
Mr. President, the Government of Grenada has adopted an ambitious 'Blue Growth' agenda to take advantage of our vast maritime territory and its countless resources. Grenada aims to be the beacon of sustainable development for maritime states around the world. Our relatively small size makes this an interesting and achievable project. Our blue growth

master plan offers many opportunities for collaboration.
Mr. President, the Caribbean Community, CARICOM, has emphasized the need to advance measures to develop sustainable ocean-based economies in the Caribbean. The word 'Caribbean' remits us to beautiful beaches like the world famous Grand Anse beach in Grenada. Our recent endeavours aim to use our maritime waters in a sustainable manner governed by robust policies in our people's interest.
Mr. President, I previously alluded to the many variables that influence the sustainability of our planet. Small states like Grenada and other CARICOM countries have to battle with threats to our access to financial markets. In March of this year, the IMF published a report titled ""Recent trends in correspondent banking relationships"" (CBRs) that highlights some of the challenges facing financial institutions and governments of small states. Observing that the number of CBRs has decreased, the IMF anticipates a negative effect on global trade and economic activity. In the specific case of Grenada and the rest of CARICOM, the disruption of international payments and capital inflows, as well as the high cost of compliance with the OECD-driven international tax agenda, were all underscored at the Ninth General Meeting between the Caribbean Community and the UN System in July of this year.

Mr. President, added to the threat of lost correspondent banking relationships, we also have to deal with the unilateral and often unfounded blacklisting of our institutions as money launderers and our countries as tax
havens.
Mr. President, Grenada has worked tirelessly to sign tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) and has signed 14 countries such agreements since 2010; the agreement with Canada in July of this year being the most recent.
Within CARICOM, Grenada's proactive approach and sense of international duty is not the exception.
It pains us as policy-makers when we expend our limited resources to comply with rules only to face arbitrary punishments when we are quite evidently doing our best. There are no easy answers to these challenges, but I urge our partners to desist from draconian approaches to these matters when dealing with vulnerable developing nations. Let us please favor reasonable and respectful dialogue before we de-risk and blacklist. In a similar vein, Grenada supports General Assembly Resolution 70/5, which calls for an end to the economic, commercial, and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba. We also believe that renewed dialogue may augur well for the discovery of a mutually acceptable way forward for both parties.

Lastly, on finance, Mr. President, I am proud to report that Grenada's structural adjustment programme has been widely successful. In May of this year, the IMF reported that, and I quote: ""Grenada has continued with steadfast implementation of reforms and made progress toward achieving the key program goals.""
Through the leadership and wisdom of our Prime Minister and the sacrifices that the Grenadian people have made, Grenada's economy and institutions are today on solid footing. Mr. President, Grenada's thriving economy today is proof that the words 'structural adjustment' are not inherently bad. Investment, both foreign and local, is at the highest levels in
recent years. We are cautious to declare victory, Mr. President. However,
we are confident, that we are headed in the right direction.
Mr. President, Human Rights should never be politicized. I believe that all 7 billion of our planet's Humans possess certain inalienable Human Rights. Mr. President, the UN Declaration on Human Rights (1948) is unambiguous. And so, if we allow ourselves to be guided by Article 1 of the Declaration, issues of racism and other forms of discrimination will have NO place in our societies.
Our recent constitutional referendum offered a renewed view of the rights and freedoms of the Grenadian people.

Grenada thanks the United Nations for coordinating the provision of essential technical support throughout the exploration of constitutional
reform.
Mr. President, Grenada continues to work with our international partners in the interest of international security. Mr. President, Grenada is active and compliant on numerous matters of international security. Grenada views the situation on the Korean peninsula with great trepidation and our position on these matters is clear and to that effect, the Cabinet of Ministers has recently approved the signing of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, is inherently destructive and serves NO useful purpose for humanity. The mere existence of these weapons is unacceptable. Let us never forget the suffering of the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mr. President, Grenada, therefore, urges its friends and allies to desist from all development and testing of these
weapons.
Mr. President, 105 BILLION US Dollars spent each year on nuclear weapons. That amounts to $12 million dollars an hour. If we are willing to make the shift from destruction to sustainable construction, the people of Barbuda, Dominica Cuba and all SIDS will be forever grateful.
Mr. President, Grenada remains preoccupied by recent political and social developments in Venezuela. In his capacity as Chair of CARICOM,
7

Grenada's Prime Minister has offered CARICOM's help in mediating discussions between the Government and the Opposition. Necessarily, Grenada's approach must be impartial. Grenada will not attempt to dictate terms to either side. What we seek is to encourage meaningful dialogue on the premise that the Venezuelan people can come together to safeguard the future of all the Venezuelan people. In the meantime, Grenada believes in the art of diplomacy and the principle of respect for State sovereignty and the right of all people to self-determination. The onus is squarely on the Government and the opposition to ensure that Venezuelans do not lose
hope.
Mr. President, during a lecture series on reparatory justice Sir. Hilary Beckles, Vice-Chancellor of the University of the West Indies, relayed the story of his upbringing on a sugar plantation at the University of Oxford. He recounted consuming handfuls of sugar in lieu of proper sustenance, and the scientifically proven impact that such practices have had on the former slaves that now inhabit Caribbean countries.
Mr. President, assigning culpability for the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and childhood obesity is a matter for another forum. That said, Grenada struggles with high rates of non-communicable diseases that put immense pressure on our limited fiscal space.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the signing of the landmark

CARICOM Heads of Government Port-of-Spain Declaration on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and while some progress has been made in reducing NCDs, Dr. Alafia Samuels, Director of the George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre, University of the West Indies states the following as it relates to CARICOM and NCDs, and I quote:
""Our soda consumption is the highest in the world. In some countries more than 30% of young people are overweight or obese. Our diabetes rates are double global rates and in some populations up to 50% of us are living with high blood pressure. It is clear that we need to accelerate our response.""
Mr. President, I am sure you would appreciate that the statistics just presented are not flattering to your call for a ""decent life for all"". The Caribbean region has the highest burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the Americas. We therefore urge key allies to continue to partner with us as we attempt to correct this unfortunate reality.
Mr. President, Grenada has made important progress in controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS. Only 0.3% of our population presently lives with this disease. The work of Grenada's National Infectious Disease Control Unit (NIDCU) and our health care practitioners and policy-makers must be highly commended for their work in this regard. That work, however, is greatly supported by international assistance that is being depleted without foreseeable replenishment as it already has in some Caribbean countries.
9

Grenada thanks the Global Fund, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), PAHO and the German Development Bank (KfW) for their assistance. I urge donors to be flexible in their relief responses. We cannot wait on data while our people suffer. Mr. President the data will come eventually but. in the meantime lives, families, communities are at
stake.
Mr. President, Grenada's commitment to ending corruption is clear and long-standing. In 2015 Grenada acceded to the UN Convention against Corruption. Thirteen years prior, in 2002, Grenada ratified the InterAmerican Convention against Corruption. We have since created the Office of the Integrity Commission, an independent body, to end the scourge of corruption.
Mr. President, I close with the assurance that Grenada believes in the UN System. I have had the honour of representing the people of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique on several occasions at thisnoble institution. As I retire from active political life, I am optimistic that the window is still open for us to leave a peaceful, inhabitable, and prosperous planet for future generations.
The challenges of our time are dynamic and continuous and we would be remiss to put anything but our planet first.

Guinea-Bissau,"Your Excellency, Mr, President of the General Assembly Distinguished Heads of State and Government Mr, Secretary-General Ladies and gentlemen
I am honored to stand on this podium and speak to the international community gathered here in the full expression of our universality. Allow me to convey greetings from the Bissau-Guinean people to all of you - distinguished Heads of State and Government, representatives of the member States of the United Nations who came to add pomp and substance to this General Assembly. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajcak, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia, who was elected President of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. To your illustrious predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson, I would like to express our recognition of his performance and wish him continued success in his remarkable diplomatic career.
Ladies and gentlemen
As we all know, the world today is full of complex and grave challenges:
Hotspots of political instability and geopolitical tension around the world, the seriousness of which cannot be overlooked by statesmen and citizens of the world;

 The scourge of terrorism, which unfortunately does not seem to abate, is a phenomenon that deserves our unanimous condemnation;
The human tragedy of migration waves, particularly those coming through the Mediterranean, the saga of refugees;
Gaping social inequality, the expanding geography of poverty, and the intensity of human suffering, which we can see in vast areas of the planet;
 The sorrow of racial, gender, and religious discrimination;
The threats of climate breakdown on a planetary scale with prospects of frightening,and not unlikely, consequences;
In short, it is not difficult to imagine how many of the ""pains of the world"" land at the United Nations on a daily basis, requiring the attention and constructive engagement of the international community represented here!
Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen,
The United Nations has a long history of solidarity with and commitment to Guinea-Bissau. It began with our Struggle for National Liberation and has not been broken ever since. Our goal is to further strengthen our institutional engagement with the United Nations.

In so doing, we are merely reaffirming our firm belief in International Law, Peace and Security among Nations; Social and Moral Progress of Humanity, which are the values on which the United Nations was created.
Mr, President,
We continue to experience a period of institutional challenges in Guinea-Bissau, for which the Conakry Accord laid out a solution in October 2016. These are challenges related to the functioning of some of our core political institutions, namely parliament and the government. But it is with profound gravity that I inform you that civilian peace reigns in my country, There are no reports of Universal Human Rights violations that merit complaints or are worthy of concern.
Public Safety indicators related to people and property follow a normal pattern. Regular payments are being made to Public Servants as well as on the foreign debt service and internal arrears.
The marketing campaign for our main export crop cashew nuts - broke all records, which had a positive impact on the social environment in Guinea-Bissau. Recently, our Public Finance controls were praised by the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral
partners.
The State and Civil Society are very far from any political breakdown. Indeed, we are fortunately not counting the dead or injured in Guinea-Bissau nor are we assessing any damages to public property resulting from a breakdown in the authority of the State.
4

The last ECOWAS Summit, which convened in Monrovia, laid a bet on the Bissau-Guinean people's determination to internally resolve the problems related to the political and institutional impasse that has set in my country for the last
two years.
In this regard, we are pleased that the African Union, in its most recent summit convened in Addis Abeba, the CPLP Council of Ministers meeting in Brasflia, and the United Nations put the political situation in Guinea-Bissau back on their agendas.
With the patience, wisdom, and solidarity of our international partners - ECOWAS, the African Union, the CPLP, and the United Nations Secretary-General, who is maintaining his Special Representative in Guinea-Bissau we will overcome the political and institutional impasse that persists in my country.
Mr, President,
We have taken note of this General Assembly's agenda, which, in fact, is largely consistent with our own hopes and
concerns.
The sub-region - of the Economic Community of West African States - where Guinea-Bissau is located has significant potential for economic growth, consistent poverty reduction, and sharing of social welfare.
There is nothing unattainable in our dream do drive - at the sub-regional level, together, in peace, in security, and with productive work - the inclusive social progress that we all
desire.
We have examples of success in our sub-region. But we also see distressing signs in the ECOWAS horizon: signs of

potential threats to both the internal constitutional order of the States and geopolitical stability in the sub-region. Terrorist actions are seriously affecting Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, C6te d'Ivoire, and Nigeria, with clear and grave consequences for peace, social cohesion, and stability. Guinea-Bissau fully supports the pooling of efforts in the context of the Sahel G5, advocates for the integrity of Mali, and calls for an all-out fight against terrorism in all of its manifestations. Indeed, in order to face so many challenges at the same time, namely internal security, preservation of the territoria! integrity of States, and peacekeeping within the space of ECOWAS, we need help. We therefore count on the United Nations and all of its specialized agencies, as well as all of our international
partners.
Only if we worked together will we be able to transform our sub-region into a bastion of peace and internal security and, by extension, a bastion in the service of international security.
Mr, President,
The ""Sustainable Development Goals"" are our challenges.
But no development strategy is worthy of such title if, in the case of Guinea-Bissau, it does not begin by placing the issue of Food Security squarely and sustainably at the core of its concept. To let Guinea-Bissau - a country with a widely recognized agricultural capacity - slip into dependence on large

volumes of imported rice every year was certainly one of the worst economic policy mistakes that were made,
The challenge we face is very clear: it is the political and economic challenge of food security; it is the moral challenge of overcoming poverty; it is the test of ensuring a situation of ""zero hunger"" in Guinea-Bissau.
With this focus in our approach, we are merely restating, with other words, Point 1 in this General Assembly's Agenda: ""Promoting health through the life-course,""
I will surprise no one when I say that there is no positive health indicator that remains standing against the violence of Poverty, Hunger or Malnutrition;
There is no way to bring down the morbidity and mortality indicators that assail us - as a result of the scourges of AIDS, Malaria, diarrheal and infectious diseases - without sustained poverty reduction, if we do not successfully take on the moral challenge of ""zero hunger.""
At a more specific level - that is, with respect to the health care that we provide to our populations, particularly Children and Women in reproductive age - we have made progress in my Country.
However, given that the State alone is unable to guarantee this public service to the entire population, we continue to rely on international cooperation, on United Nations support through its specialized institutions.
But Health and Poverty are not the only elements that go hand in hand.
We also do not see how, in the context of poverty, of extreme nutritional deficiency, we can aim for good Education for our children.

Hr. President, Ladies and gentlemen,
Twelve percent of Guinea-Bissau's territory are ecologically protected areas according to recognized scientific criteria. In this regard, I can say without hesitation that one of our most important educational achievements has been the development of a vigilant ecological awareness, of an increasingly sharp and active sense of environmental responsibility, especially among the youth in Guinea-Bissau - the foundation of our future. But we are realistic: we have a long road ahead of us, much effort to be made in order to ensure environmental sustainability as we economically exploit our natural resources. We consider the Paris Accord to be a fundamental victory in harmonizing the States' environmental policies, and in their promotion worldwide.
Hr. President, Ladies and gentlemen
We must enhance our relations with the People's Republic of China, a country that has been our friend since the difficult years of our Struggle for National Liberation. As the ""One China"" policy is consistent with Peace and Security in the region and with China's yearning for its unity to be restored, we reiterate our full solidarity with the People's Republic of China.

The Security Council reform continues to be a need that the international community has rightly highlighted. Guinea-Bissau's position is the same one that we, as an African country, advocated for and adopted within the framework of the African Union.
To the People of the Republic of Sierra Leone, who has suffered so harshly with the natural disaster that has assailed their country, I express the solidarity of the People and the Government of Guinea-Bissau.
We also offer our solidarity to all the countries that have been victimized by natural calamities causing irreparable losses of human lives, destruction of property, and great suffering among the survivors.
To the Republic of Cuba, which has been solidary toward the Bissau-Guinean people at our most challenging moments, I express the unfailing solidarity of the BissauGuinean people. Today, as in the past, we call for the lifting of the economic embargo that has, for more than sixty years, prevented our friendly nation from developing normally.
We also support the hopes of the Palestinian People for the establishment of their own SLate coexisting side by side with the StaLe of Israel, based on Trust, Peace, and Security.
Mr. President,
I will close my remarks with a reference to the Women of Guinea-Bissau. I would like to say that women in GuineaBissau are still far from taking the place that they deserve in our society and in our institutions in general.
The policy of Gender Equality, more specifically of equal opportunity for girls and women in Guinea-Bissau is undoubtedly a test for democracy in my country.

It is a great challenge for our political parties and all government officials in Guinea-Bissau. I hope that all the political, economic, and social actors in my country will continue to converge on the legitimate advocacy for Women's Rights and, in general, for the promotion of Human Rights in Guinea-Bissau. Thank you very much for your attention

Guyana,"Salutations
Mr President, Mr Secretary-General,
Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.
The Cooperative Republic of Guyana extends its congratulations to His Excellency Miroslav Lajcak on his election to the Presidency of the General Assembly. We are confident, Mr. President, that under your guidance, progress will be made in advancing the international agenda andin realising the theme ofthisyear's session oftheAssembly
- """"Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent lifefor all on a sustainable
planet.""
Guyana expresses its appreciation for the sterling performance of your predecessor. Ambassador Peter Thompson of Fiji for his stewardship of the Assembly over the past
year.
I take this opportunity, also, to congratulate the distinguished Secretary-General, Mr
Antonio Guterres, on his election last year. I wish him a successful tenure.

People, peace and the planet
Mr President,
Nothing is more important, in this General Debate, than that alldelegates should respect the relevant theme - Focusing onpeople: Strivingfor peace and a decentlifefor all on
a sustainable planet.
People
First, the theme enjoins us to focus on people - people of all countries and in all circumstances. The theme is about the human condition - of people in states that are largeand small;rich and poor;strong and weak. Thetheme is about humanit/s condition
everywhere on earth.
The world faces several, serious, humanitarian crises. Children, in too many parts of the world, still die from preventable diseases or go to bed hungry. Women, in some places, are denied equal opportunities to enjoy a 'good life'. The gap between the world's rich and its poor remains unacceptably wide. Conflicts, within states, have spawned international refugee crises which have resulted in millions being displaced from their homelands.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent our collective desire and determination to eradicate hunger and poverty from our planet while promoting equal opportunities in education, employment and social justice for both men and women. The adoption of the SDGs has catalysed our aspirations for a better world into concrete and forward-looking actions and objectives.
The respective'Goals' seek to promote respect for the inherent dignity of people and thenrights as human beings. The advancement of these 'Goals', however, is being obstructed bythe incidence ofhuman rights violations and the involuntarymigrationof peoplefrom
their homelands and by terrorism and warfare.
The challenge to the UN is to resolve to reinforce respect for the rights of citizens within
the governance structures ofour member states.

Planet
Second, a sustainable planet is humanity's ultimate patrimony. Nothing is more vital to people's survival. We have been indifferent too long to the need to protect the planet and now its sustainability is threatened on many fronts.
Climate change is not a fiction or the invention of a few extremists. The small island states
of the Caribbean and parts of North America have felt the devastating fuiy of a series of hurricanes - Harvey, Irma, Jose, Katia, Lee and Maria- to whose frequency and ferocity mankind has contributed through the reckless exploitation of earth's resources.
Hurricane Irma was a deadly, destructive portent of the extreme vulnerability and fragility of the small island developing and low-lying coastal states of the Caribbean. Guyana is playing its part, within the limits of its resources, to provide relief to affected
populations in sister Caribbean states.
Guyana signed and celebrated the Paris Agreement on climate change last year in this Assembly. We renew our commitment to its goals this year. This is demonstrated most positively in Guyana's pioneeringrole in global environmental stewardship.
Guyana, in 1989 - three years before the Rio Conference of 1992 - had the foresight to enter into an environmental covenant with the international communityby dedicating
360,000 hectares of its rainforest:
""...to develop, demonstrate and make available to Guyana and the international community, systems, methods and techniques for the sustainable utilization ofthe multiple resources ofthe tropicalforests and the conservation ofbiological diversity,.""
Guyana, twenty years after that international initiative, entered an agreement with the
Kingdom of Norway:
""...to work together toprovide the world with a relevant, replicable model of how Reducing Emissions and Forest Degradation, plus conservation and sustainableforest management (REDD+) can align the development objectives offorest countries with the need to combat climate change.""

Guyana is part of the 'Guiana Shield', one of the world'slast remainingblocks of pristine rainforest. The 'Shield' is the source of 15 per cent of the world's freshwater reserves. The 'Shield's' biodiversity provides ecosystem services such as food, freshwater and medicinal products. It provides environmental services such as the regulation of the water cycle, water quality and pollination. The 'Shield's' forests capture and store carbon, thereby mitigating the greenhouse effect. The 'Shield' is essential to lifeon the planet.
Guyana callson the United Nations to help protect and preserve the 'Guiana Shield' as a global resource for the survival and sustainability of our planet.
Peace
Third, 'striving for peace' has been the principal purpose and preoccupation of this organization throughout its existence. A good life for the world's peoples and the sustainable use of the planet's resources are predicated on peace withjustice, including
justice within and between states. The world is weary of war.
'Striving for peace' must be humanity's ceaseless quest. The United Nations is the paramount global instrument of peace. It has a vital role to play in ensuring respect for international law through the International Court of Justice and the Security Council.
'Striving for peace' must aim at resolving long-standing inter-state conflicts. Guyana, in this regard, supports the call for the reform of the Security Council to give even greater
voice to developing countries.
We iterate our support for a two-state solution to the Palestine-Israeli conflict. We affirm the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and to a dignified existence.
We demand the withdrawal of the injurious economic embargo against the Caribbean island of Cuba. The embargo frustrates that state's right to development.
'Striving for peace' and the right to development have been Guyana's deepest concern
since Independence in 1966.

I addressed this Honourable Assembly last September, explaining the danger we have been facing on our borders as a consequence of the territorial claims of our western neighbour - the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. I laid before the world's nations the peril Guyana was enduring on its borders at the hands of Venezuela.
Venezuela's claim to Guyana's territory, however, has not diminished or been diverted. Guyana remains imperilled. Disturbing developments within Venezuela have attracted the world's attention and roused the concerns of many of us over the privations of its people.
The Caribbean people wish for the Caribbean to be a Zone of Peace. The Venezuelan claim to Guyana's territorial integrity, however, would be a threat to that zone. Venezuela is more than four times the size of Guyana. Venezuela, however, claims two-thirds of Guyana's territory including our maritime space.
We depend on our territorial and maritime resources for development and for the release of our people from poverty.
The Venezuelan claim persists after fifty-one years of Independence. An eminent international Arbitral Tribunal provided 'a full, perfect and final settlement' 118 years ago in 1899. Venezuela denounced that Arbitral Award in 1962 at the Decolonisation Committee of this Assembly as British Guiana strove for its Independence.
Guyana warns the world, through this Assembly, that peace will be at stake in our region if justice does not become ascendant, not only within Venezuela, but also in respect to its border controversy with Guyana.
Four UN Secretaries-General have been seized of the Venezuelan claims. The choice has
become one between just and peaceful settlement in accordance with international law, and a Venezuelanposture of attrition that is increasinglymore blustering and militaristic. In this matter, protraction is the enemy of resolution and the ally of sustained conflict.
Fortunately, as they indicated publicly, former Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and current Secretary General Antonio Guterres have decided that, under the 1966 Geneva Agreement, if by the end of the year 2017 significant progress has not been made toward

arriving at a full agreement for the settlement of the controversy, the International Court of Justice will be the next means of peaceful settlement, unless Guyana and Venezuela jointly request otherwise.
Guyana has been working assiduously with the Secretary General's Personal Representative. Guyana looks to the international community to ensure that Venezuela is not allowedto thwart the processes ofjudicial settlement whichare the clear and agreed path to peace and justice.
Nations, United
The people of the world yearn ""to fulfil their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment"" - an attainable objective of the Sustainable Development Goals
endorsed by the United Nations.
Peace for the world's peoples is the mandate ofthe United Nations. Peace can be achieved by addressing the world's humanitarian crises, promoting justice within and between nations and resolving long-standing conflicts between states.
Planet earth can provide a 'goodlife' for all.The planet can be protected from the ravages of climate change and the reckless damage to its ecology and biodiversity.
United, the nations gathered here can fulfil the promise of the UN Charter and the theme
of the General Assembly to focus on people, to strive for peace and to protect the planet.
I thank you."
Holy_See,"Mr. President,
On behalf of His Holiness Pope Francis, I am pleased to congratulate Your Excellency on your election as President of this august Assembly and to commend you on the choice of the topic for this General Debate: ""Focusing on People: Striving for peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet.""
It is a congenial topic for the Holy See. Pope Francis never tires of insisting on people first, especially those who suffer, those who are excluded, marginalized and left behind. The Catholic Church expresses the meaning of focusing on people in these words: ""The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men [and women] of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted... are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ,"" because ""indeed, nothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in their hearts.""1

Focusing on people means not only protecting them from heinous crimes but also placing them ahead of all national and geopolitical interests and fulfilling all the international political commitments undertaken along the history of the United Nations that relate to social and economic development, starting with those contained in the Charter of the United Nations (Charter of the United Nations, paragraph 4 of the Preamble, article 1.3 and chapter IX).
Mr. President,
Putting people always first means protecting, at every stage and in every circumstance, the dignity of the person, and its human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in a specific way, the rights to life and to freedom of religion from which all other rights flow and which are therefore the common foundation of the pillars of peace and security and integral human development. These two human rights are indivisible from those other rights and fundamental freedoms relating to a dignified spiritual, material and intellectual life for each citizen and for their families  among others, the right to food, the right to water, the right for housing, the right to a safe environment and the right to work.2
With the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the international community committed itself to effective measures to eradicate the root causes of various evils and indignities that many people in the world today are facing. Moments before this Assembly adopted the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, Pope Francis defined the Agenda as an ""important sign of hope.""3
One of the fundamental reasons of this hope is that world leaders agreed on ""a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity,"" ""determined to end poverty and hunger, in all their forms and dimensions,"" and to ensure ""that all human beings can fulfil their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment.""4 Their common resolve to ""leave no one behind"" articulates the core of this focus on people.

Regarding political commitments, Pope Francis has also warned this Organization and the international community against falling into what could be called ""declarationist nominalism"". We must, for that reason, guard against ""assuaged consciences"" and ""feeling good,"" simply because the 2030 Agenda and other important international accords have been adopted. On the contrary, we must not rest until the legal commitments have been truly accomplished and the political promises have been fulfilled in the lives of people. This requires taking a hard and honest look at the principal challenges that peoples of the world are facing today and will face tomorrow. With this in mind, responsible compliance with the Climate Framework Convention and its Paris Agreement, as well as the implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and of the 2030 Agenda could be a way of focusing all countries and international organizations on working together for peace, leaving aside the dangerous game of exchanging threats.
From this perspective, the Holy See sees the forthcoming ""reform and finetuning of the UN Development System""5 as an additional opportunity to place people and their needs at the centre of our action. In doing so, as Pope Francis reminded us here two years ago, we have to ""allow them to be dignified agents of their own destiny.""6
Mr. President,
Christian Churches, in particular the Orthodox and the Catholic Churches, celebrate together on 1 September the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, to heighten public awareness of their shared responsibility to take care of our common home and to contribute to reversing environmental degradation. To mark the World Day of Prayer this year, Pope Francis and the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew released a Joint Message affirming that: ""The earth was entrusted to us as a sublime gift and legacy, for which all of us share responsibility... Our human dignity and welfare are deeply connected to our care for the whole of creation.""7
This call for responsible stewardship finds particular urgency before the deteriorating conditions of our common home and an often purely utilitarian

worldview concerning the things that surround us. Any harm done to the environment is harm done to humanity, of today and tomorrow. Thus, the misuse and destruction of the environment are also accompanied by a relentless process of exclusion, as the deterioration of the planet affects, first and foremost, the many billions imprisoned in poverty and in conditions of environmental stress across the globe. This dramatic reality of exclusion and inequality must lead all of us to take stock of our shared and individual responsibilities. The pressing call and challenge to care for creation invite all of humanity to work without hesitation toward sustainable and integral development.
Improving climate conditions and the natural environment is possible only if we accept the need to change the way we perceive the world and if we change the way we relate to it. Although our common home is falling into serious disrepair, we can reverse the trend of environmental degradation. Indeed, as Pope Francis underlined in his Encyclical Laudato Si', while we are capable of the worst, we are also capable of the best, rising above ourselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start.8
Mr. President,
The duty to prevent wars and violent conflicts is an essential component of the Responsibility to Protect. Thus, the Holy See appreciates the Secretary General's explicit and strong emphasis on preventive diplomacy and concurs with his assessment that the ""most serious shortcoming"" of ""the entire international community is the frequent inability to prevent crises.""9 Prevention requires, first of all, restoring faith in the capacity of humankind for dialogue. An environment of trust is urgently needed. All countries should take a decisive and urgent step back from the present escalation of military preparations. The largest countries and those who have a stronger tradition of respecting human rights should be the first to perform generous actions of pacification. All the diplomatic and political means of mediation should be engaged to avoid the unspeakable.

Mr. President,
Allow me to recall the appeal of Pope Pius XII to all nations on the eve of the Second World War: ""the way of justice is promoted by the strength of reason and not with the force of arms... The danger is imminent, but there is still time... nothing is lost with peace. With war, everything is lost. May people come back to understand each other and take up again negotiations. By negotiating with good will and with respect for mutual rights, they will realize that sincere and active negotiations never precludes an honourable success.""10
In such a context, I would like to recall that a dozen years have passed since the historical gathering of world leaders in this Hall for the 2005 World Summit. Focusing on people, the heads of state and government of the members of this Organization reached consensus on the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.11 There is no doubt that a collective political consensus is necessary, but a reflection on articles 2.7 and 39 of the Charter of the United Nations is also needed.
The Holy See thus supports all those initiatives that will facilitate the observance of obligations under the Responsibility to Protect, but it would like to remind the international community, once again, that without a legal framework and a fair respect of the international rule of law, the application of the Principle is not feasible.
The war in Yemen is causing a humanitarian catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions. The tragedy from the war in Syria continues to grow every day. Involved players should sit at the UN negotiating table with the sole pre-condition of respecting human rights law and principles and allowing humanitarian access and assistance. At the same time, States, especially those who at some time in recent history have been directly or indirectly involved in the conflict, must undertake all means to reach a ceasefire, a first step towards peace.
The Holy See is particularly concerned for the political divisions and instability in Venezuela with its humanitarian crisis. Also, the complex political and diplomatic tensions in the Arabian Peninsula and the violence, together with the

various humanitarian situations, in the Middle East must be adequately addressed by the international community. All must strive for an end to violence and reach ""a solution which can enable Palestinians and Israelis alike to live at last in peace within clearly established and internationally recognized borders, thus implementing the `two state solution'"".12 The ongoing violence and intense political tension in the Democratic Republic of the Congo necessitate an urgent and efficient commitment from all parties to find a solution to the constitutional crisis. Furthermore, there is a need to promote a genuine public awareness of certain ongoing situations of conflict with a view to reaching a negotiated and peaceful solution, especially in Ukraine, South Sudan and Central African Republic, among others.
Along the same lines, as Pope Francis has stated, there is ""another kind of conflict which is not always so open, yet is silently killing millions of people. Another kind of war experienced by many of our societies as a result of the narcotics trade"".13 The drug trade has joined other forms of corruption and has ""penetrated to different levels of social, political, military, artistic and religious life, and, in many cases, has given rise to a parallel structure which threatens the credibility of our institutions"".14
In the same vein, the Holy See is concerned with the challenges of fighting corruption and terrorism and with promoting stable peace and a sustainable development in many countries of the world. The Holy See also wishes to stress again that terrorism can only be countered by more cohesive and coherent measures at the international level. As terror knows no border, the international community must act as a whole.15
Mr. President,
The full protection of people is only possible with a durable peace. However, the protection of civilian populations must be assured also during warfare. The recent and gangrening conflicts both weaken, as well as reveal the shortcomings, of the international order, and they cause inexplicable suffering, massive displacements, blatant violations of universal human rights and fundamental

freedoms and extreme poverty. There is no worse manmade crisis than violent conflicts. They drive people forcibly to migrate or become refugees. They engender mass atrocities and crimes against humanity. Indeed, as Pope Francis told this Assembly, ""War is the negation of all rights.""16 The lamentable situation of the hundreds of millions of migrants and refugees fleeing from wars, persecutions, natural disasters and extreme poverty, especially in Nigeria, Myanmar, Somalia, and some countries of the Sub-Saharan region, among others, is a great responsibility for all without exception.
Our common humanity impels us all, as Pope Francis has proposed, to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate those who flee from such adverse conditions.17 These four actions are based on the proposition that migrants, in spite of many real or imagined challenges, are a good for society, and on the principle of solidarity with those in need. In particular, they express our shared responsibility toward the victims of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity that the international community has failed to prevent or stop, in blatant neglect of the principles of international law.
The Holy See will vigorously work to have these four concepts enshrined and reflected in the future Global Compact on safe, orderly and regular migrations, and the Global Compact for refugees. The Holy See believes that these UN-led processes offer a unique opportunity to respond together to challenges through international cooperation and shared responsibility. The Holy See urges the international community to overcome the current political impasse and to go beyond the negative sentiments that we face in opening safe, orderly and regular pathways for migration. In order to achieve the desired outcome, the contribution of political communities, civil societies and all stakeholders is indispensable, each according to their own responsibilities.
While some migrants may be motivated by the legitimate desire of improving their already acceptable situation, most would likely choose not to migrate if they enjoyed peace and economic security in their home countries. It is a basic human right to live in one's own country, but that right is effective only if the root causes that force people to migrate -- such as wars and conflicts, mass atrocities and

persecutions, and dire economic and environmental hardships -- are given adequate solutions. Indeed, if basic necessary conditions are met, people will not feel forced to leave their homes, making migration manageable and voluntary. Thus, the focus in negotiating the Compacts should not be limited to stopping migrants in their tracks or confining refugees in camps, but instead, it should address the causes that deprive them of living with dignity and that force them to make life-threatening journeys. This should be our goal. And this should be a key part of the Global Compact for Migration.
Mr. President,
Another great challenge facing the international community is trafficking in persons. At the root of this and other contemporary forms of slavery are wars and conflicts, extreme poverty, underdevelopment and exclusion, lack of education, lack of employment opportunities and environmental catastrophes. But we ought to recognize that on the demand side of such criminal trafficking there is also a crass selfishness, which reaches unimaginable levels of moral irresponsibility in the case of the trafficking of children, organs, tissues and embryos and in the so-called transplant tourism. Such execrable trade is exacerbated by corruption on the part of public officers and common people willing to do anything for financial gain. Indeed, the migration and refugee crises are facilitating an increase in trafficking in persons and other contemporary forms of slavery.
The Holy See and the Catholic Church have long spoken out against the evil of trafficking in persons and through the dedicated work of so many individuals and institutions, they have sought to fight its root causes, to care for the victims, to raise awareness about it, and to work with anyone and everyone to try to eliminate it. Pope Francis calls trafficking in persons an ""open wound on the body of contemporary society""18 and an ""atrocious scourge that is present throughout the world on a broad scale.""19
At the heart of this evil, however, is the utter loss of respect for human dignity and the total indifference to the sufferings of fellow human beings. Modern slavery

happens when ""people are treated as objects,"" which leads to their being ""deceived, raped, often sold and resold for various purposes, and in the end either killed or left devastated in mind and body, only to be finally thrown away or abandoned.""20 Refocusing on people, putting people first in the overall work of this Organization ought unhesitatingly to support the fight against trafficking in persons and other contemporary forms of slavery.
Pope Francis calls on all, in particular the competent authorities, to address such a heinous crime through effective juridical instruments, to punish those who profit from it, to assist the healing and the reintegration of its victims, and to eradicate its root causes. Our response must be commensurate to this great evil of our time.
Mr. President,
The world is awash with all types of weapons, from nuclear weapons to small arms and light weapons. The arms trade, both licit and illicit, keeps on growing. The proliferation of arms, including weapons of mass destruction, among terrorist groups and other non-state actors has become a real danger.
These trends are deeply worrying, but more disturbing still is the deep chasm that separates commitments from actions in the field of disarmament and arms control. While everyone condemns the grave effects of arms proliferation, nothing has substantially changed on the ground, because, as Pope Francis observed, ""We say the words `No more war!' but at the same time we manufacture weapons and sell them... to those who are at war with one another.""21
This must change. The proliferation of weapons simply aggravates situations of conflict and results in unimaginable human suffering and material costs, profoundly undermining development, human rights and the search for lasting peace. Without greater international and regional cooperation, especially among weapons-producing States, to control and limit strictly the production and

movement of weapons, a world free of wars and violent conflicts will surely remain an illusion.
When Pope Francis addressed this Assembly two years ago today, he drew attention to the ""urgent need to work for a world free of nuclear weapons, in full application of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), in letter and spirit, with the goal of a complete prohibition of these weapons.""22 In his 2017 World Day of Peace Message, Pope Francis once again made a plea for disarmament and for ""the prohibition and abolition of nuclear weapons.""23 Unfortunately, the proliferation of nuclear weapons increases international tensions, as is witnessed in the Korean Peninsula. As history demonstrates, regional and bilateral treaties of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons have been effective in establishing whole regions free of these arms. In this sense, it seems all the more urgent to invest in building those circumstances that would facilitate the creation of new bilateral and regional treaties.
The Holy See has signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and has already deposited its ratification, because it believes that it is an important contribution in the overall effort toward complete nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, an advance toward the fulfilment of the commitment of the States Parties to the NPT ""to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament,"" and a step toward negotiating a ""general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.""24
While much remains to be done for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons truly to make a difference and achieve its full promise, the Holy See believes that it is one more blow on the anvil toward the fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah: ""They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; One nation shall not raise the sword against another, nor shall they train for war again.""25
Thank you, Mr. President."
Hungary,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentleman, Your Excellencies, Dear colleagues,
First of all, let me start with congratulating Miroslav Lajck to be elected as the President of the General Assembly. For us, Central Europeans, it's highly important, that a Central European candidate was elected to such an important position, which shows that Central Europe is a strong region which has reached success through policies based on rationality and common sense. And if you put these together with the fact that Poland was elected to the Security Council, it is a proof that the Central European alliance is strong and can speak on a loud united voice, which is heard far away as well.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentleman, Dear Colleagues,
During the times we are convened to the General Assembly of the United Nations, we are living extremely challenging times. Economic, political, defence and military relations change extremely rapidly. And as coming from Central Europe, I would like to highlight three very important issues from our angle, about migration and the threat of terror, about relationship between East and West, and about the rights of national minorities.
Europe is currently in the frontline of significant global changes. Europe has never had to face so many challenges at the meantime after the conclusion of the cold war than currently. The migration crisis and as the consequence of that, the most serious threat of terror ever ended up in a situation that the European Union has to face the most serious challenges ever since its foundation. The western part of Europe used to be the most secure, the safest and the most peaceful region globally. A couple years back, as we watched news on television from the Middle East, we were quite sure and certain, that such kind of events would surely not happen in Europe. But to the contrary, currently the fear of terrorist attacks became part of everyday life. Between 2015 and 2017 Europe had to suffer of 30 major terrorist attacks demanding 300 lives innocent. Churches, airports, beaches, concerts became venues of execution within couple of seconds. This development, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Colleagues, is a direct consequence of two phenomenon:
Number one, the massive influx of illegal migrants. During the last two and a half years, 1.5 million illegal migrants entered the territory of European Union without any kind of control, check or regulation. And that definitely gave the opportunity to the terrorist organizations to take advantage of this flow and send their terrorists, their fighters to the European Continent. And number two, Mr. President and here I will break some taboos and dogmas for sure, we have to admit, that former social inauguration procedures in the western part of Europe ended up in failure. Some integration processes of former migrants who arrived to Europe earlier were totally unsuccessful and in many places of the western part of Europe parallel societies have been constructed.
Distinguished Colleagues,
To be honest, we have to admit, that we are shocked, that after the barbaric terrorist attacks in Europe, after the massive violations of national and international laws and regulations and after that thousands have lost their lives on the Mediterranean sea and the elsewhere there are still leaders of international organizations and representatives of big and strong countries who
2

emphasize that migration is favorable and migration is a phenomenon to be encouraged. This is an unacceptable and an extremely irresponsible way of behavior. Praising and encouraging migratory waves rushes multiple thousands of people into danger. Those ones who take a life hazard to get to a place where they think that they would find a better way of life, and rushing multiple thousands of people into danger in a way that might become victims of terrorist attacks by terrorists, who take advantage of the migratory waves.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The position of Hungary is rather clear. All states have their fundamental right and responsibility to guarantee security for its people. All states have their fundamental right and responsibility to protect their own borders. And all states have their fundamental right and responsibility to make their decisions on their own, whom they let enter the territory of that given country and whom they do not let do so.
Hungary has put enormous efforts to comply with its international obligations. We have spent 800 million euros on protecting not only ourselves, not only the border of Hungary, but the external border of European Union, and the external border of the Schengen area. We built physical infrastructure and mobilized human resources. 800 million euros altogether. Although I have to tell you that the phenomenon that we do not only protect ourselves, but the western part of Europe as well, does not occur for first time in history.
But, Ladies and Gentlemen, as representing a Christian country, we of course take the obligation to help people in need and Hungary helps. But the principal for Hungary to help is that we have to bring help where it is needed. That is why we help and assist Christian communities in the Middle East to be able to stay and, or to be able to return after conflicts are over.
We have spent almost 2 million euros on reconstructing two hundred houses in Iraqi township called Telsqof making it possible for more than 1300 people to return.
We spend 4 million euros on building schools, on covering medical expenses and on helping the Christian communities to be able to stay and to get strengthen and we offer a hundred of scholarships on an annual basis for those youngsters whose families are being persecuted in the region.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We understand that the rights of people have to be restored where they were violated. We have to help people to stay as close to their homes as it is possible and we have to help people to return to their homes as soon as possible. We urge for more support for countries which have been taking care of refugees around war-torn areas, such as Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and the Kurdish region of Iraq.
Although Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. President we are all aware that the complete and final solution for the migration crisis would be tackling the root causes, thus to overcome military conflicts around Europe and to eliminate terrorist organizations.
3

And if you do not mind Mr. President, I would like to turn to the second point to the relationship between east and west. You know, I represent a small Central European country and we are all aware that major international conflicts can be resolved through agreements between the super powers on the west and on the east, so that is why a pragmatic cooperation between east and west is necessary. A pragmatic cooperation between east and west is necessary to eliminate the most dangerous terrorist groups world-wide. Hungary is proud to contribute with 200 troops to the fight against ISIS. East and west cooperation is necessary to overcome the war and create peace in Syria, thus to make it possible for people to return and decrease the migratory pressure on Europe. And east to west cooperation is necessary to make peace in Libya and insures stability for the future. And east and west cooperation is necessary to address the extraordinary challenge posed by a communist dictator, threatening the world with a nuclear program, violating all possible international regulations and values. We Central Europeans have learnt the lesson of history whenever there is a conflict between east and west, Central Europe loses for sure. And we do not want to be losers anymore. That is why we wish and urge for a better and more pragmatic relationship and a better and a more pragmatic cooperation between east and west based on mutual trust and based on respect towards each other and based on respect towards the international law.
Mr. President as the third and final point from a Central European angle, I would like to emphasize a little bit the importance of the rights of national minorities. I have to tell you that Hungary is very sensitive on this issue as millions of Hungarians are living outside of our borders. The rights of national minorities are among the most protected rights in our national relations. There is an international consensus, we believe at least, that the rights of national minorities must be respected by all members of the international community, and discrimination against any kind of minorities is just simply unacceptable. Among rights of national minorities one of the most important elements is the right to use mother tongue and to receive education on the mother tongue. And why it is the most important: because the best way to create difficult circumstances to national minorities is to prohibit to use its native language by regulation.
It is not an accident that language rights are also elaborated in the variety of guiding documents and international standards such as the 1992 UN declaration on the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. The UNESCO's three principles on language and education and the various recommendations of the UN forum on minority issues on implementing the declaration of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. These documents describe similar basic approach for state authorities to meet their human rights obligations involving language.
Unfortunately, the parliament of Ukraine has adopted a new law on education on the 5th September. This new law drastically curbs the already acquired level of minority rights in education and language use. This new law takes away the right from every kids above the age of ten to receive education on their mother tongue. It is a shame that such kind of a legislation is being passed in the 21st century in a country which makes a lot in order to be quicker on the integration process and association process to the European Union. This law is a clear discrimination against the minorities living in Ukraine. The UNESCO Convention against
4

discrimination in education Article 1 clearly states that discrimination includes any distinction, exclusion, limitation or preference, which being based on race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic condition or birth, has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing equality of treatment in education. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is obvious that the new Ukrainian law on education clearly violates these UN conventions and international norms, that is why it would create a very dangerous precedent if United Nations does not act in this regard and remain silent. We strongly urge the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to start investigating the new Ukrainian law on education and use all means at disposal to address the severe violation of fundamental minority rights by the new Ukrainian law. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. President, Hungary will always stand by the Hungarian communities regardless where they live in the world and we will never let them down. This is our obligation, this is our responsibility and it comes from our heart as well. Thank you very much for your kind attention.

Iceland,"Mr. President,
We live in a world of opportunity: Never have we had such potential to end poverty and hunger, to end human rights violation, to focus on the people striving for a decent life. We can either succeed or we can fail. It is a choice, it is a decision. This is our responsibility, this is our task. This task is not just about numbers or statistics, this task is about real-life people. ""There is purpose and worth to each and every life."" Let us not forget.
Our task is not easy. But the most important things in life are never easy, the right path is always difficult. And for sure, we face difficulties. The consequences of climate change, bad governance, terrorism and conflict have made our world seem ""more dangerous, less predictable, more chaotic"" as our Secretary General put it. It is our common responsibility to protect the progress we have made since the establishment of this institution and make good on our promises of prosperity for all.
Mr. President,
The world's economic and social progress has in large part been driven by science and rational action, based on evidence. We must hold firm to this approach: only policy grounded in facts and evidence, can help us deal with common threats like climate change and to create a world that truly reflects our values.
The Paris Climate Agreement and Agenda 2030 provide the blueprints for our success. Now we must deliver. Droughts, sea-level rise, ocean acidification and other consequences of climate change have wide-ranging implications for all our communities. Climate change is nowhere as visible as in the Arctic with far-reaching consequences in the other parts of the world. The melting of the polar ice in the north causes higher sea levels in the south. What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic.
In fulfilling our Paris Agreement obligations, collectively with other European countries, we aim to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030, compared to 1990. Iceland remains committed to this end.
Mr. President,
Since the establishment of this institution, a rule-based international order has been the foundation for peace and prosperity. The assault on the rule of law by certain governments undermines the stability of the international system.
We condemn in the strongest terms the illegal actions of North Korean leaders and call on them to accept generous offers to return to the negotiating table. During the past weeks, we have at last seen a united Security Council act firmly but constructively; to push for dialogue and confidence-building measures while staying firm on strengthening sanctions in the face of continued provocation.
The use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Government against its own people was a blatant violation of international and humanitarian laws and demanded a firm response by the international community.
2

Complex internal conflicts have led to displacement and suffering on a massive scale, with famine looming in many areas, including Yemen. The issue of Western Sahara remains unresolved with tensions rising. The disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is another serious assault on the international rule-based order.
The Security Council bears primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Along with several other countries, Iceland has encouraged the Security Council to include long-term perspectives in its mission mandates to lay the foundations for lasting peace.
Mr. President,
The modern era has also seen the rise of non-state actors  something our system did not plan for. Terrorists have sought to undermine trust and tolerance within and between our communities. Alongside improvements of the UN anti-terrorism mechanism, we must identify the drivers of violent extremism and terrorism. At the heart of conflict and violent extremism lies a failure of development. This is where Agenda 2030 must play a vital role.
Agenda 2030 is, indeed, a remarkable achievement. It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as human rights, peace and development are inseparable and essential to successful implementation of the Agenda. I take very seriously the Secretary-General's warning that ""Disregard for human rights is a disease, and it is a disease that is spreading  north, south, east and west.""
The violation of freedom of expression, of rights to free assembly, of the fundamental rights of women - all undermine Agenda 2030. Extra-judicial killings, repression of minorities and the denial of the right to legitimate opposition set back sustainable development, sometimes by generations. Here I would like to express deep concern at the completely unacceptable situation of the Rohingya population in Myanmar.
Iceland knows first-hand the massive potential resting in gender equality. With UN Women as a key partner, Iceland is a dedicated proponent of women's human rights. We actively work to engage men in the fight for gender equality and, indeed, our Prime Minister is a HeForShe IMPACT Champion. We support UNFPA and the She Decides initiative for sexual and reproductive health and rights, and continue to promote women's participation in the peace and security agenda.
I commend the Secretary-General for his commitment to gender equality within the UN and his determination in addressing the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers and UN staff  a betrayal of the civilians under their care, and of the values of the UN.
Mr. President,
In the beginning of the 20th century, Iceland was one the poorest countries in western Europe. Now, we are one of the richest. Why? The answer to that question is the key for our approach to task at hand, to deliver for the people of this world who are striving for a decent life, to make sure that everyone can benefit from this world of ours, the world of opportunities.
3

Iceland's path from rags to riches is a text book example of the power of free trade. We gained access to large foreign markets where we could sell our products and by doing so we changed our fortune. Every year we gather here in the capital of free trade and talk about the importance of ending poverty in the world. We can talk the talk, but can we really walk the walk?
We can really do something about this. We can open our markets. We can let the poorer countries trade freely with our consumers. Let's trade.
And let's keep in mind, that free trade is not only the exchange of goods or services for money. Free trade is forming relationships, free trade is people interacting, travelling, understanding each other, regardless of colour or religion. Free trade is the most powerful tool to establish and maintaining peace.
Mr. President,
While the markets of richest countries in the world remain closed to the poorest countries, it is truly our obligation to provide development assistance. A large share of Iceland's bilateral assistance goes to the Least Developed countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.
We focus on our areas of expertise, such as energy and fisheries, while at the same time ensuring a horizontal emphasis on human rights and gender equality. To share our knowledge and experience, Iceland hosts UNU programs on fisheries management, geothermal energy and land restoration, in addition to its UNU gender program.
Through projects and partnerships with IRENA, SE4ALL and the World Bank, Iceland works actively to increase the utilization of sustainable geothermal energy and we support the work of the UNCCD and FAO to increase food security and mitigate climate change through land restoration.
Continuing a tradition of leadership in oceans affairs, Iceland actively contributed to the UN Oceans Conference earlier this year. Our many commitments include reducing marine litter and plastics in the ocean  an issue on which governments, businesses and individuals must cooperate. Allow me to welcome the Secretary-General's appointment of Mr. Peter Thomson as his special envoy for the ocean. We look forward to working with Mr. Thomson.
Unlocking the transformative potential of people and the private sector is key to success. In financing for development, we must be clear that development cooperation, while vital, is only a small part of what is needed. Good governance, strong institutions, human rights and equal opportunity are essential to inclusive economic progress, which eventually depends on the political will of leaders. Creating an environment where doing business is easy and investment makes sense is key to growth.
Iceland believes strongly in the potential of globalization and international trade as an engine for economic growth and poverty reduction. We must continue to promote a universal, rulesbased, fair, multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization (WTO). At the same time, we must be aware of measures necessary to enable the Least Developed Countries to participate on fair terms. If we are to achieve the SDGs, this is not the time to erect trade barriers.
4

Mr. President, The dire situation of the sixty-five million people driven from their homes by conflict, economic hardship and climate change urgently requires a solution. How we, as an international community address migration will define us for future generations. The forthcoming process towards Global Compacts for Refugees and for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration will give us the opportunity to establish new and comprehensive approaches to this challenge of our age. These approaches must be grounded in humanitarian law and respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially children. As host communities, we should not forget the positive contribution migrants can make to growth and sustainable development. Iceland has received an ever-increasing number of refugees via UNHCR in addition to providing generous assistance to UN Agencies working in the neighbouring countries of Syria. We will continue to do our part. Mr. President, Our forefathers, scarred by the catastrophe of world war and economic depression, had the foresight to set up the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions. Just as this great building was renovated so successfully a few years ago, so too must the UN be renovated and made fit for purpose in the modern era. We strongly support the work of the Secretary-General in management reform, development reform, and his sustaining peace agenda. Thank you, Mr. President.

India,"Mr President
Let me begin by offering my heartiest congratulations on your election as
President of the 72nd United Nations General Assembly. For those of us
fortunate to represent our nations as Foreign Minister this is a particularly
happy event: one of us has this honor.
Mr President
2: India welcomes your efforts to place people at the heart of international
diplomacy as you shape policy and lend direction to world affairs from your august chair. I thank you for the theme you have chosen: 'Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet'. People, peace, decency, sustenance and focus define a noble objective.
Mr President
3: The United Nations was established for the welfare, security, harmony,
rights and economic progress of the people of our world. India fully supports
your efforts in this great mission.
4: I had spoken before this Assembly last year as well. It is a year that has seen much change both in this Assembly ^d iii the world it. represents. We have a new Secretary General at the United Nations. He is determined to prepare and strengthen the United Nations to meet the challenges of the 21^^ century. We welcome his efforts, and see in him a leader who can give
practical shape to a vision.
Mr President
5: Our contemporary world is trapped in a deluge of troubles of which, surely, the most dangerous is the relentless rise of violence, Terrorism, and the ideas that engineer this evil, are spreading at the pace of a conflagration. Climate change stares us in the face, and threatens us with its dimension. There is a growing question mark over maritime security. For a mix of reasons, provocative and inflammatory, people are leaving the psychological,
cultural and economic comfort of their traditional home space to seek refuge on distant shores causing global anxiety. A large part of the globe's population is still tortured by hunger and poverty. The young are beginning to lose hope as they confront unemployment. Women, victims of historic discrimination, are demanding what they must get: gender empowerment.

Nuclear proliferation is back in the zone of dangerous headlines. Cyber
security has become a source of deep insecurity.
6: In 2015, we set ourselves a target of 2030 to find solutions to many
challenges on this Agenda. Two of these years have already passed. Surely it is already time to ask how much has happened. If complacency defines the next 13 years then we are in danger of losing control. We need a sense of urgency as well as unshakeable fortitude to take decisions that can avert
catastrophe.
7; I am pleased that India has displayed the courage and leadership to take tough decisions which have launched the interlinked process of sustainable development. The complete eradication of poverty is the most important
priority of the present government. Mr President, There are two ways of
addressing the curse of poverty. The traditional method is through
incremental levels of aid and hand-holding. But our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chosen the more radical route, through economic
empowerment. The poor are not helpless: we have merely deemed them opportunity. We are eliminating poverty by investing in the poor. We are
turning them from job-seekers into job-providers.
8: All our economic programs have a principal purpose, die
empowerment of the poor; Jan Dhan, Mudra, Ujjwala, Skill India, Digital India, Clean India, Start-Up India, Stand-Up India. To describe them all
would take up more time than 1have at my disposal, and I shall therefore
dwell on only three core programs.
9: The Jan Dhan plan must surely count as the world's largest financial inclusion scheme. At least 300 million Indians who had never crossed the doors of a bank today have bank accounts; this is equivalent to the
population of the United States of America. This was, understandably, not easy to complete in three years, but our banks, achieved this visionary goal set by our Prime Minister. While some remain to be included, the target has
been set - every Indian family will have a bank account.
10; Mudra yojana has enabled government to fund the unfunded. Those who had never dreamt that bank credit was within their options, today, through Mudra, are getting soft loans without collateral to begin micro businesses. 1

am particularly delighted to inform you that over 70 per cent of these loans have gone to women. Unemployment spreads despair. Through Skill India, Start-Up India and Stand-Up India poor and middle class youth are being
trained to match their honed talent with bank credit and become self-
employed or small-scale entrepreneurs.
11: Ujjwala is a signature scheme of our government. Free gas cylinders are being provided to the poor so that women do not have to suffer the dangerous consequences of wood-fired kitchens. Uniquely, gender emancipation is at the creative core of this program.
12: Demonetization was a courageous decision to challenge one of the by products of corruption, the ""black money"" that disappeared from circulation. Today, India has passed the Goods and Services Tax legislation, through which there is one-tax across the country, without the untidy and punishing system of multiple taxes under differing categories in different parts of the country. Our ""Save the girl, Educate the girl"" campaign is reducing gender inequality. Our Clean India program is generating what can only be described as a revolutionary change in social attitudes and habits.
13: I would like to note, at this point, that nations with rising capabilities will be able to generate such change, but the developed world must become an active partner in helping those vulnerable countries which are still mired in stagnant poverty reach SDG horizon within 2030. That is why the principle of Global Partnership was included in SDGs. I am happy to report that India has started, this year, the India-UN Development Partnership
Fund.
Mr President
14: We are completely engaged in fighting poverty; alas, our neighbor Pakistan seems only engaged in fighting us. On Thursday, from this dais,
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khakan Abbasi wasted rather too much of
his speech in making accusations against us. He accused India of State sponsored terrorism, and of violating human rights. Those listening had only one observation: ""Look who's talking!"" A country that has been the world's greatest exporter of havoc, death and inhumanity became a champion of hypocrisy by preaching about humanity from this podium.

15: Pakistan's Prime Minister claimed that his nation's founder Mohammad
Ali Jinnah had bequeathed a foreign policy based on peace and friendship. I
would like to remind him that while it remains open to question whether Jinnah Sahab actually advocated such principles, what is beyond doubt is that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has, from the moment he took his oath of office, offered the hand of peace, and friendship. Pakistan's Prime Minister must answer why his nation spurned this offer.
16: Prime Minister Abbasi has recalled old resolutions that have been long
overtaken by events. But his memory has conveniently failed him where it matters. He has forgotten that under the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore
Declaration India and Pakistan resolved that they would settle all
outstanding issues bilaterally. The reality is that Pakistan's politicians remember everything, manipulate memory into a convenience. They are
masters at ""forgetting"" facts that destroy their version.
17: Pakistan's current Prime Minister spoke of a ""Comprehensive Dialogue""
between our two countries. I would like to remind him that on 9 December
2015, when I was in Islamabad for the Heart of Asia conference, a decision was made by his leader Mian Nawaz Sharif, then still Prime Minister, that dialogue between us should be renewed and named it a ""Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue"". The word ""bilateral"" was used consciously to remove any confusion or doubt about the fact that the proposed talks would be between our two nations and only between our two nations, without any third-party present. And he must answer why that proposal withered, because Pakistan
is responsible for the aborting that peace process.
18: I would like today to tell Pakistan's politicians just this much, that perhaps the wisest thing they could do is to look within. India and Pakistan
became free within hours of each other. Why is it that today India is a
recognized IT superpower in the world, and Pakistan is recognized only as
the pre-eminent export factory for terror?
19: India has risen despite being the principal destination of Pakistan s nefarious export of terrorism. There have been many governments under many parties during 70 years of Indian freedom, for we have been a sustained democracy. Every government has done its bit for India's
development. We have marched ahead, consistently, without pause, in

Education, Health and across the range of human welfare. We established
scientific and technical institutions which are the pride of the world. But what has Pakistan offered to the world and indeed to its own people apart
from terrorism? We produced scholars, doctors, engineers. What have you produced? You have produced terrorists. Doctors save people from death;
terrorists send them to death. If Pakistan had spent on its development
what it has spent on developing terror, both Pakistan and the world would
be safer and better-off today.
Mr. President
20: Terrorism is at the very top of problems for which the United Nations is
searching for solutions. We have been the oldest victims of this terrible and
even traumatic terrorism. When we began articulating about this menace,
many of the world's big powers .dismissed this as a law and order issue. Now they know better. The question is: what do we do about it?
21: We must all introspect and ask ourselves whether our talk is anywhere
close to the action we take. We all condemn this evil, and piously resolve to
fight it in all our declaratory statements. The truth is that these have
become rituals. The fact is that when we are required to fight and destroy
this enemy, the self-interest of some leads them, towards duplicity.
.22: This has been going on for years. Although India proposed a
Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) as early as in 1996, yet two decades later the United Nations has not been able to agree upon a definition of terrorism. If we cannot agree to define our enemy, how can we fight together? If we continue to differentiate between good terrorists
and bad terrorists, how can we fight together? If even the United Nations Security Council cannot agree on the listing of terrorists, how can we fight
together?
Mr President
23: Through you, with utmost sincerely I would like to request this august assembly to stop seeing this evil with self-defeating and indeed meaningless
nuance. Evil is evil. Let us accept that terrorism is an existentialist danger to humankind. There is absolutely no justification for this barbaric violence. Let us display our new commitment by reaching agreement on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism this year itself..

Mr President
24: I had- identified climate change as one of the significant dangers to our
existence. India has already said that it is deeply committed to the Paris Accord. This is not because we are afraid of any power, influenced by friend
or foe, or tempted by some imagined greed. This is an outcome of a
philosophy that is at least 5000 years old. Our Prime Minister has, on his personal initiative, launched the International Solar Alliance as witness to
our abiding commitment to a cause.
25: When we talk of. world peace, we mean peace not only among, human beings but also peace with nature. We understand that human nature is sometimes inimical to nature, but we would like to amend human nature when it tends in the. wrong, directions. When we inflict our greed upon
nature, nature sometimes explodes. We must learn to live with the imperatives, cycles and creative urges of nature; in that lies, our own
salvation.
26: We have just witnessed hurricanes, earthquakes, rains that inundate,
storms which terrify. This is not a mere coincidence. Nature sent ,its
warning to the world even before the world's leadership gathered in New
York at the United Nations through Harvey. Once our gathering began an
earthquake struck Mexico and a hurricane landed in Dominica. We must understand this requires more serious action than talk. The developed world
must listen more carefully than others, because it has more capacities than
others. It must help the less fortunate through technology transfer and
Green Climate Financing - that is the only way to save future generations.
Mr President
27: We are discussing turbulence and change across the world, but the one
organization created to address world affairs is beset by its own problems. It
seems to believe that it can afford not to change from the precepts and perceptions that determined its birth. On 18 September, there was a
meeting here on UN reform. 1participated. 1witnessed an evident desire for change, to do. something. But 1do want to remind you that at the 2005
World Summit there was a consensus that the early reform of the Security Council is an essential element of our overall effort to reform the United
. Nations.

28: Efforts at text-based negotiations on the reform and expansion of the
Security Council were initiated in the last session and more than 160
nations had expressed support for this effort. If we are serious, then the least we can do is produce one text that can be the basis for negotiation. I hope that under your enlightened leadership, Mr President, this will become a priority. If that happens it will be a significant achievement.
29: We also have high expectations from the new Secretary General of the
United Nations. If he wants to reform the peace and security architecture, he will also need to address reforms related to peacekeeping that have been urged for long. Without improvements in UN Peacekeeping this goal can't be
achieved.
Mr President
30: There is no shortage of issues; there is even less shortage of problems which should be recognized from this podium. But time is not always on the side of those who would like to raise issues and problems in the interests of a better, more peaceful and progressive future. The issues you have chosen are relevant to the UN Charter as well as to the ancient traditions of my
land.
Mr President
31: My country's culture and thought has been shaped by a history and philosophy that believes in peace as humankind's only rational and practical objective. We truly believe that the world is one family and we hope that every member of this family deserves that elixir of life, happiness. Let me end by reciting a verse that is a synthesis of thought:
May all be happy; May all be healthy; May all see what is good; May aU be free from suffering.
Thank you, Mr. President."
Indonesia,"Mr. President,
Allow me to begin by wishing ""Happy New Year"" to those who celebrate the New Islamic Year 1439 Hijra... may peace be upon us all. I would also like to extend Indonesia's deep sympathies and condolences, to those affected by the recent natural disasters. These include, earthquake in Mexico, hurricanes in the Caribbean, and parts of the United States, as well as floods in South Asia. Our prayers go out to all the victims.
Mr. President, I congratulate you, on your election as President, of the seventy-second General Assembly. Indonesia is committed, to contribute to your successful presidency.
I would also like, to thank His Excellency Peter Thomson, of Fiji, for his able stewardship, as the President of the seventy first session. We commend his role in driving a universal push for the SDGs.
Mr. President, We are all represented in same world map. Yet, we see many different worlds. Our world today, is far from equitable.

Among the peoples of our world, there are wars, hunger, extreme poverty, and illiteracy.
Common peace and equal prosperity are distance away.
Indonesia therefore welcomes, the theme of this year's assembly, ""Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet"".
The theme recognizes the importance to place, the needs of the people, first.
It highlights that peace; prosperity, and sustainability, are mutually
reinforcing.
In this context, I wish to underline 3 (three) important points, for achieving ""Peace and aDecent Life for AII on a Sustainable Planet"".
First, it must be underlined, peace is never given.
It has to be developed, and nurtured.
We must work, towards creating a global ecosystem of peace and stability.
Indonesia's experience in ASEAN, shows that building such an ecosystem is fundamental.
It is fundamental for economic development.
It is fundamental for the prosperity of the people.

Indonesia firmly believes, developing a global ecosystem of peace and stability, is doable.
However, to succeed, we must practice the habit of dialogue, inclusiveness, peaceful settlement of disputes, and non-use of force.
More importantly, we must develop the UN as a robust global institution, that emphasizes on the maintenance of peace, security and stability.
Key to this, is ensuring the UN reform process results in a strong, effective and relevant United Nations .... --) and it was for this reason .... that Indonesia co-sponsored the
Declaration of support for UN Reform.
Furthermore, we must also strengthen, the international peacekeeping and peace building mechanisms.
Indonesia is honored, to have contributed in mediating conflicts, peace keeping and peace building beyond our borders.
We have, and will always be ready, to be part of a global solution.
In the last 60 (sixty) years, we have contributed more than 38,000 (thirty eight thousand) personnel to 28 (twenty-eight) UN peacekeeping
operations.
We currently deploy more than 2,700 (two-thousand seven-hundred) peacekeepers in 9 (nine) peacekeeping missions.
And we are determined, to achieving 4,000 (four-thousand) personnel by 2019 (two-thousand nineteen) .... including increasing female
peacekeepers.

Beyond peacekeeping, Indonesia is an active member of the Peace building Commission.
We underline, that ensuring sustainable peace at global level, requires a global ""culture of prevention"".
It is also important to ensure a strong partnership between the United Nations, relevant regional organizations, and national governments.
Mr. President,
A global ecosystem of peace and stability, requires the international community to settle, one of the longest unresolved conflicts.
The Palestine-Israel conflict.
This year, marks half a century of the illegal occupation of Palestine.
We shall not give up. Palestine is in the heart of Indonesian foreign Policy. Indonesia will continue to support Palestine.
After 50 (fifty) years of stalemate, we need a fresh approach.
A sustainable and innovative approach that can bring about a two-States solution.
Mr. President,
Sustainable peace is not an end in itself.
Decent life for all people, must be our global goal.
This leads me, to my second point.

There must be synergies, between sustaining peace and development agenda. We must cultivate peace and stability, to work for us in achieving sustainable development. The international system is well equipped to attain decent life for all.
A number of global commitments have been agreed. The SDGs, the Climate Change Paris Agreement to name two.
However, commitments must be translated into concrete actions.
The key to this, is the means of implementations, for least developed and developing countries. Adequate funding, technical assistance and capacity building, as well as transfer of technology are important elements for success.
Also, it is important to support regions that have huge potentials, and have undertaken great reforms, towards sustainable development.
Africa, Mr. President, is one such region.
For Indonesia, South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC), is our way to supporting development in least developed and developing countries.
In the last three years, we have organized 167 (one-hundred sixty-seven) South-South and Triangular Cooperation programs.

Over two thousand participants from least developed and developing countries have benefited.
Indonesia is also proud to host the first Indonesia - Africa Forum in April 2018 (two-thousand eighteen).
This is our commitment, to strengthening partnership with Africa, towards achieving sustainable development.
Mr. President,
Synergy between sustaining peace and development agenda requires a society that is just, inclusive and fully respects human rights.
There should be, no more man-made humanitarian crisis in this world.
Indonesia shares the concern of the international community on the developments in Rakhine State.
We have proposed a 4+1 (four plus one) Formula to the government of Myanmar, placing the needs and welfare of the people at the center.
People-centered development must therefore, be at the heart of national development program.
That is why Indonesia continues to strengthen democracy and good governance at all level.
Over the past ten years, through the Bali Democracy Forum, Indonesia has also shared experiences and best practices on our democracy.
Working to strengthen democracy to the wider region.

Furthermore, development must also not come at the expense of the environment.
Despite the skeptics... Climate change is real. It is happening as we speak.
Like many Small Island Developing States, Indonesia with over 17,000 (seventeen-thousand) islands, is feeling the changing weather patterns, and rising sea level.
It will affect the sustainability of our development - even our survival.
Indonesia is therefore, fully committed to the Paris Agreement.
We call on all countries, to implement their obligations under the Paris
Agreement.
Mr. President,
One of the greatest challenges to our global order, and development agenda, is the threat of terrorism, radicalism and violent extremism.
This threat is real, imminent and ever presence.
Terrorism undermines peace and disrupts development.
Thus, my third point, the urgent need for a global action and partnership to combat terrorism, radicalism and violent extremism.
Key to tackling terrorism is to address the root causes.
Addressing extreme-poverty, illiteracy, and the massive youth
unemployment..

For Indonesia, we have adopted a comprehensive approach to addressing terrorism, radicalism and violent extremism.
A seamless combination of using hard and soft powers .... Strengthening law enforcement and rule of law ....
While at the same time fostering engagement with the communities .... through education, empowerment as well as interfaith and cultural dialogue.
Indonesia also implements, a comprehensive program for de-radicalization and the re-integration, for those that have been radicalized or have gone to dark side.
We have de-radicalized over one thousand six hundred extremists, in over 72 (seventy two) prisons in Indonesia.
In this digital age of social media .... Terrorism is like cancer.., it spreads quickly and is deadly .... No one country can address it in isolation.
Global cooperation and comprehensive approach is the only panacea, to eradicating the threat.
Mr. President,
As global challenges become more complex, it is evident that unilateralism is not a sustainable solution.
The world needs strong partnership .... A true global partnership.
Indonesia has long believed in global partnership...
8
INDONESIA

For this believe stems from, our embedded national slogan ""bersatu kita teguh bercerai kita runtuh"" . Which translates into ""united we stand divided we fall"" Indonesia always desires to always contribute to global partnership ....
 To global peace and security... .
 To global prosperity .. ...
 Indonesia has presented its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the year 2019 (two-thousand nineteen) to 2020 (two-thousand twenty) Indonesia..... a true partner for world peace..... We are counting on your support for our candidacy. Thank you Mr . President."
Iran_(Islamic_Republic_of),"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I wish at the outset to congratulate your election to the Presidency of the General Assembly and Secretary-General Guterres' election to his high office and wish him every success in his crucial responsibilities.
Four months ago, over 41 million people-constituting 73% of Iran's total eligible voters-came to the polls in the country's 12th presidential election and once again expressed confidence in my platform, which calls for moderation and respect for human rights and prosperity and economic revitalization at home, and constructive engagement around the world . Their vote manifested the maturity of the electorate in a society that has experienced free and democratic governance for only four decades. This was not merely a vote for a president, but a huge political investment by our population; a resilient people who truly constitute our most reliable asset.
Human and citizens' rights, along with the quest for justice and Islamic values, have constituted the most pivotal demands of the Iranian people in over 150 years of struggle, and particularly in the Islamic Revolution of 1979. In its first term, while pursuing nuclear negotiations internationally, my government focused at home on the deliberation and articulation of citizens' rights leading to the promulgation of ""The Charter of Citizens' Rights"" and its issuance for implementation . Adoption of this Charter conformed to the demands of a people who rose against dictatorial regimes, aspiring to restore their rights and human dignity 111 years ago in the Constitutional Revolution, and again in the Islamic Revolution 39 years ago.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I declare before this august global assembly that moderation is the inclination as well as the chosen path of the great Iranian people. Moderation seeks neither isolation nor hegemony; It implies neither indifference, nor intransigence.
The path of moderation is the path of peace; but a just and inclusive peace: not peace for one nation, and war and turmoil for others;
Moderation is freedom and democracy; but in an inclusive and comprehensive manner: not purporting to promote freedom in one place while supporting dictators elsewhere;

Moderation is the synergy of ideas and not the dance of swords;
And finally, the path of moderation nurtures beauty. Deadly-weapons exports are not beautiful; rather, peace is.
We in Iran st rive to build peace and promote the human rights of peoples and nations. We never condone tyranny and we always defend the voiceless. We never threaten anyone; but we do not tolerate threats from anyone. Our discourse is one of dignity and respect) and we are unmoved by threats and intimidation . We believe in dialogue and negotiation based on equal footing and mutual respect.
In today's globalized world, peace, security) stability and the progress of all nation s are intertwined. It is not possible that a rogue and racist regime trample upon the most basic rights of the Palestinians, and the usurpers of this land enjoy security. It is simply impossible for anybody to aspire to attain long-term stability, prosperity and development, while Muslims in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Myanmar and so many other places live in misery , war and poverty.
Mr. President,
Throughout its history, Iran has been the bastion of tolerance for various religions and ethnicities. We are the same people who rescued the Jews from Babylonian servitude; opened our arms to welcome Armenian Christians in our mid st, and created the ""Iranian cultural continent"" with a unique mix of diverse religions and ethnicities. I represent the same Iran that has historically assisted the oppressed: centuries ago, we supported the rights of the Jewish people and today we insist on the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people. Iran is the still the same country : supporting justice and seeking tranquility.
Today, we are on the frontlines of fighting terror and religious extremism in the Middle east; not for sect arian or ethnic reasons) but for an ethical, humanitarian and strategic one.
Iran does not seek to restore it s ancient empire, impose its official religion on others, or export its revolution through the fo rce of arms. We are so confident in the depth of our culture, the truth of our faith and tenacity and longevity of our revolution that we will never seek to export any of them in the way neo-colonialists do, with the heavy boots of soldiers.
To promote our culture, civilization, religion and revolution, we enter hearts and engage minds. We recite our poetry and engage in discourse on our philosophy.
Our ambassadors are our poets, our mystics and our philosophers. We have reached the shores of thi s side of the Atlantic through Rumi and spread our influence throughout Asia with Saadi. We have already captured the world with Hafez; we therefore are in no need of new conquests.
Excellencies,

The call of moderation is from a nation that has been committed to it. We are not preaching moderation, but practicing it . The JCPOA is a case in point.
The deal is the outcome of two years of intensive multilateral negotiations, overwhelmingly applauded by the international community and endorsed by the Security Council as a part of Resolution 2231. As such, it belongs to the international community in its entirety, and not to only one or two countries.
The JCPOA can become a new model for global interactions; interactions based on mutual constructive engagement between all of us. We have opened our doors to engagement and cooperation. We have concluded scores of development agreements with advanced countries of both East and West. Unfortunately, some have deprived themselves of this unique opportunity. They have imposed sanctions really against themselves, and nowtheyfeel betrayed . We were not deceived , nor did we cheat or deceive anyone. We have ourselves determined the extent of our nuclear program. We never sought to achieve deterrence through nuclear weapons; we have immunized ourselves through our knowledge and - more importantly - the resilience of our people. This is our talent and our approach. Some have claimed to have wanted to deprive Iran of nuclear weapons; weapons that we have continuously and vociferously rejected. And, of course, we were not and are not distressed for forgoing an option that we in fact never sought . It is reprehensible that the rogue Zionist regime that threatens regional and global security with its nuclear arsenal and is not committed to any international instrument or safeguard, has the audacity to preach peaceful nations.
Just imagine for a minute how the Middle East would look had the JCPOA not been concluded. Imagine that along with civil wars , Takfiri terror, humanitarian nightmares, and complex socio political crises in West Asia, that there was a manufactured nuclear crisis . How would we all fare?
I declare before you that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not be the first country to violate the agreement; but it will respond decisively and resolutely to its violation by any party. It will be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by ""rogue"" newcomers to the world of politics : the world will have lost a great opportunity. But such unfortunate behavior will never impede Iran's course of progress and advancement. By violating its international commitments, the new US administration only destroys its own credibility and undermines international confidence in negotiating with it, or accepting its word or promise.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Four years ago, the Islamic Republic of Iran sponsored the initiative ofthe World Against Violence and Extremism (WAVE) in this Assembly . We consider dialogue and negotiations based on a positive-sum paradigm as the only path towards the resolution of global and regional crises. We have made a conscious decision to strengthen relations with our neighbors and the region, and to enhance cooperation with all friendly countries. It is impossible to navigate through the complex and dangerous challenges in this turbulent transitional global phase without expanding interactions and exchanges and institutionalizing dialogue between nations and states.

The ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric, filled with ridiculously baseless allegations, that was uttered before this august body yesterday, was not only unfit to be heard at the United Nations - which wa s established to promote peace and respect between nations - but indeed contradicted the demands of our nations from this world body to bring governments together to combat war and terror.
I wish to underscore here that the defense capabilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, including our missiles, are solely defensive deterrents for the maintenance of regional peace and stability and the prevention of adventurist tendencies of irrational aspirants. We cannot forget that civilians in many of our cities became the targets of long-range missile attacks by Sad dam Hussein during his 8-year war of aggression against us. We will never allow our people to become victims of such catastrophic delusions again.
Instability and extremist violence have only been ex-acerbated in our region through the military interventions of extra-regional actors-the same powers that try to sell ever more oftheir deadly weapons to other states by accusing Iran of fomenting instability. I want to emphasize that foreign intervention and the imposition of alien wishes on the people of the region will only widen and deepen the crises in our region. The crises in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain do not have military solutions and can only be resolved through cessation of hostilities, and the acceptance of the will and wishes of the populaces.
The United States Government should explain to its own people why, after spending billions of dollars of the assets of the people of America and of our region, instead of contributing to peace and stability, it has only brought war, misery, poverty and the rise of terrorism and extremism to the region.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Over the past 4 years, Iran's economy demonstrated that it has unparalleled potential for expansion and growth. Economic sanctions not only did not impede Iran, but instead solidified popular resolve to enhance domestic production. Achieving the highest global growth rate last year proved that Iranian economy can become the most vibrant emerging economy within the next twenty years, with a trillion-dollar growth potential. Our strategic choice for achieving such sustainable and balanced growth is extensive global partnership. We are of the firm belief that development and security can only grow together, and common interests can bind us regionally and globally to guarantee both regional and global security.
Iran, enjoying the world's largest gas and oil reserves, is prepared to engage in long-term cooperation to advance global energy security. We are eager to expand international transit corridors through joint ventures in sea, rail and road infrastructure projects. Our achievements in enhancing economic infrastructures in the fields of a nation-wide gas pipeline, national electricity grid, and rail and road transport, have made it possible for various industries to produce at lower cost, with easy access to national and regional markets. With the current conducive legal environment, many delegations of foreign investors have come to Iran, leading

to an ever-increasing number of investments, joint venture s and financin g agreement s in various field s.
It is the policy of my government to continue to st eadi ly enhance the entrepreneurial environment, protect intellectual property rights, continuously improve corporate governance, and engage in a robust campaign against money-laundering in orderto enhance a conducive legal climate for business and economic investments in various fields, particularly in knowled ge-based enterprises.
The Iranian nation is resolutely determined to build a free and advanced Iran and participate in the development of a secure and st able region based on ethics and respect for international law. In this endeavor, we welcome the participation and cooperation of all inve stors, intellectuals and innovators from across the globe . From this global podium , and as the representative of the people of Iran - who are world-famous for their hospitality - I invite all those who seek peace, security and progress through partnership and cooperation among nations to visit Iran and join us in buildin g this future of hope .
Ladies and Gentlemen,
If we truly believe in our collective decision four years ago here in this General assembly to make a WAVE - a World Against Violence and Extremism - we can turn the discourse of imposition, unilateralism, intimidation and war into the logic of dialogue, synergy and peace so that moderation can become the dominant voice across the globe .
I thank you for your attention."
Ireland,"President Allow me at the beginning of my statement to offer Ireland's sympathy to all those in Mexico affected by the devastating earthquake earlier this week and to commend those who have been engaged in the heroic rescue operations. I also want to extend condolences to the representatives of people in the Caribbean who are facing extraordinarily difficulties following the recent
hurricanes.
President This is no time for business as usual. The international community is facing unprecedented challenges.
I'm here because I think this Organisation matters. This is an Organisation that now faces daily challenges to its political and management missions. We need to move from debate to action.
My country, Ireland, has kept faith with the UN since we joined as a young Republic which had fought hard for its independence and saw being a member of the UN as fundamental to its future and its people's future peace and security. We still do over 60 years later.
Our faith has not been misplaced. It is as strong today as ever in the past. But we certainly have something to say about the future of the Organisation and the role we believe it must play in reducing suffering across the globe, and securing our shared peace, security and prosperity. The UN matters to us.
Today I will focus on where we see we can make a difference as the UN, and where Ireland makes a difference in the UN.
Given our history as a small country, with its own troubled past, we see very clearly the advantages of a rules-based order in international affairs. Even more than that, it is precisely because Ireland is small, outward looking and heavily dependent on external trade for our wellbeing that we pursue an active foreign policy.

As Ireland's experience in the European Union has shown us, we are stronger acting collectively than we are acting alone. Partnership and cooperation has brought peace and prosperity to Europe. In fact, for Ireland, our membership of the European Union, worldng with other European Union Member States has strengthened our independence and self-confidence rather than diminished it.
The case for international cooperation and multilateralism is compelling. By working together we lay foundations of trust, we align our perspectives more closely, we accept our differences more willingly and we build habits of cooperation that better allow us to address the common threats and opportunities we face.
The alternatives ofunilateralism, transactional diplomacy, protectionism and confrontation are not, in fact, viable. Their short-term populist appeal obscures their long-term cost.
We are living in an era where local and global challenges are intersecting with increasing frequency and force. Today's problems do not carry passports or recognise international borders. There are no unilateral solutions to these problems.
Local and regional issues - climate change, migration, armed conflict and hunger - often become global issues, including in comers of the world that are far from the origin of the problems. We cannot ignore them.
The enormous scale of the challenges facing the world might lead some to question whether multilateralism and the UN are up to the task. My response is that they can be and that they must
be.
When properly mobilised, when we pull together and move from debating to actually getting things done, we can move mountains. The UN delivers extraordinary results such as the Paris Climate Agreement. The UN has led the global effort to eradicate Smallpox; end Apartheidi promote Arms Control; save the lives of millions of children through UNICEF; and protect our cultural heritage through UNESCO. We owe much to the UN.
2

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a stand-out recent achievement. The Sustainable Development Goals have the power and potential to transform our world, addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality and instability. However, their potential can only be realised through a strong and confident multilateral system which empowers Member States to reach the ambitious but necessary targets we have set ourselves.
Having played an important role in facilitating agreement on the SDGs in 2015, Ireland is committed to their implementation, domestically and through our foreign policy.
Failure is not an option. The UN is the fulcrum upon which we can leverage the change required. But the walls dividing the three pillars of the UN - development, human rights and peace and security- have in the past impeded our efforts to accelerate sustainable development. The SDGs represent a fundamental breakthrough, recognising the many aspects of sustainable deve!opment that straddle the pillars. As we move forward on implementation we must break down the organisation's institutional silos that hinder progress.
President
Since we gathered here a year ago we appointed Antdnio Guterres as Secretary-General. Ireland believes he has the skills, the experience and the compassion to do this vmT tough job. The difficult international environment demands more than ever brave and principled leadership. We welcome the clear direction the Secretary-General is providing and the steps he is taking to reform the organisation.
And, while we, the Member States, have expressed confidence that the Secretary-General has the abilities to lead the UN forward at a time when the world is crying out for better multilateral engagement, we must allow him to lead. It is very tempting for the Member States to micromanage the work of the Secretariat. But such an approach will likely impede, not enhance, reform.

But, it is not enough that only the UN's internal mechanisms meet twenty-first century standards. The UN's political bodies must also better reflect today's world. Nowhere is this more evident than with regard to the composition of the Security Council. The Security Council does not reflect the world that has evolved since the UN was established in 1945. Quite plainly, we would be hard pressed to find any entity - in the public or private sectors - that remains so untouched by the changes and realities in the world around it.
Vast areas of our world are either insufficiently represented or not represented at all. The need to increase the size of the Council is clear to see. Ireland sees the obvious need for much stronger African representation on the Council so that there can be a greater African say in Council decisions affecting their continent. We would also favour consideration of a designated seat for Small Island Developing States.
And let's be clear. While the use or threat of the veto remains in place, the work of the Council is impeded and the UN can be paralysed in its response to the gravest crises facing the international community. The failure of the Security Council to take action to prevent mass atrocity crimes most recently with regard to Syria, but also on other occasions - betrays victims and weakens the credibility of the UN. The case for reform is thus not an academic or institutional question. It is a deeper question of legitimacy and effectiveness.
President Ireland's commitment to the UN and to the multilateral system based on rule of law is as strong today as it has ever been. Although geographically a small island on the periphery of Europe, our people and our outlook are global, influenced by connecting with people and events around the world.
No part of our contribution to the UN resonates more with the Irish people than our UN peacekeepers. The thousands of men and women who have served under blue helmets represent Ireland, our people and our values. Since 1958, when Irish troops first began selwing the UN, not a day has passed without Irish participation in the UN's peace support operations. We believe we make a difference.
4

Ireland's peacekeepers have been natural soldier-diplomats in trouble spots across the globe, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, doing the UN's work day by day and deed by deed. Today, with almost 550 troops in the field, Ireland is the highest per capita European Union contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping with deployments to six UN missions across the Middle East and Africa. We are making a substantial contribution to UNIFIL in particular, where, as always, our peacekeepers act with impartiality and integrity, and provide the leadership required in a difficult environment.
I am pleased to note that Ireland is committed to doubling the number of women in our Defence Forces, with the aim also of increasing female partic!pation in peacekeeping. As the Secretary General said at the Security Council this week, and as we know from the Women Pe'ace and Security agenda, increased female participation leads to better decision making, improved situational awareness, a better focus on protection of civilians, and enhanced reporting of and accountability for sexual exploitation and abuse.
We all know that conflict prevention has the potential to save lives and to protect hard-won development gains - and that it comes at a lower financial cost than peacekeeping operations and post-conflict peacebuilding. We strongly support the Secretary-General's efforts to re-orient the international community's thinking toward crisis and conflict prevention. Flowing from our painstaking conflict resolution efforts on the island of Ireland, we seek to share our national experience in our work on conflict prevention, mediation and state-building.
The huge growth in UN peacekeeping operations in the past decade tells us that, sadly, the scope for conflict prevention is broad. Of course, conflict prevention involves policy planning and engagement on the ground, all of which requires funding. We have very recently seen some reductions in peacekeeping operations and their associated costs. We might reasonably ask if a small part of these savings could be used to provide stable funding for the UN's conflict prevention work.

As the first State to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968 we have a deep commitment to its full implementation. Earlier this week I was very pleased to sign the recently approved Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons which was supported by 122 members of this Assembly. Ireland is proud to have played a leadership role together with Austria, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa, in bringing forward the UN Resolution convening the Diplomatic Conference that negotiated this ground-breaking treaty.
The case for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons has never been stronger as the volatile situation.in the Korean Peninsula makes clear. I unreservedly condemn the recent series of missile and nuclear weapons testing by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These developments highlight the urgent need for the swift and immediate entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
President
The scale and severity of humanitarian crises is one of the greatest challenges facing the  international community. Ireland is committed to providing hmnanitarian assistance and contributing to international efforts to ease the plight of civilians caught in conflicts in South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Iraq to name but a few. As these large-scale crises dominate the headlines, Ireland is conscious of the many 'forgotten' and underfunded crises and the need to maintain a focus on ensuring that human suffering, wherewr in the world it occurs, is not ignored.
The vast majority of displaced people are being sheltered in communities already experiencing high levels of vulnerability and poverty, placing a huge strain on already limited resources. As such, Ireland is supporting both refugees and vulnerable host communities, on the basis of need. I particularly want to acknowledge the generosity of many States- such as Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda - which are hosting very large numbers of people displaced by conflicts in neighbouring countries.

Ireland is proud of its strong and targeted contribution to eradicating global hunger, reducing extreme poverty, addressing conflict and instability and responding to humanitarian crises where they occur.
For Ireland, strong partnerships, especially with Least Developed Countries, will remain at the core of our approach as we together work for a peaceful and prosperous future. We will also vork closely with the UN system. We applaud the Secretary General's efforts to enhance coherence, effectiveness and accountability, and the delivery of results where it matters most on the ground.
The UN Charter does not begin ""We the Member States"", but rather ""We the Peoples"". Our policies and actions mustreflect this, the inherent equality of humanity at the core of our multilateral system. In practice this means listening to and heeding the voices of women, the voices of young people, the voices of the marginalised. The Women Peace and Security agenda has had a hugely positive impact globally with the realisation that we can create more durable and sustainable peace by working to ensure that women play their rightful role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts. Ireland will play our part, including as chair of the Commission on the Status of Women during the next two years.
A similar strategic approach must also be taken in engaging youth,, in all our countries. Young people must have a role in shaping a future that they will ultimately inherit.
We have a phrase in Irish, ""mol an 6ige agus tiocfaidh si"" which, broadly translated, states ""praise the youth and they will come"". I can't think of any continent where this is more relevant today than in Africa. Young people are key to achieving the SDGs and we must find ways to encourage their active participation in shaping the solutions to current challenges, It's their future and we have to involve them in shaping it.
There are very positive signs. The vitality of entrepreneurship and the creative use of technology. Infrastructure development and the potential of renewable energy. Increasing

access to good education. Improvements in agricultural yields and adding value to commodities. Better prospects for women and girls in political and economic life
There are also difficult obstacles to be overcome. But as the Sustainable Development Goals remind us, we live in an interconnected world, each challenge affecting the other. African countries are particularly affected by global challenges, such as climate change, conflict and food insecurity, which can only be addressed in their African contexts in a spirit of effective global partnership. Such partnership requires understanding local perspectives anchored in local experience, in particular on how to tackle root causes.
I want Ireland to play a leading role in Europe in helping to build better and more effective partnerships with Africa, rooted in shared interests and values, sustained over the medium to long term. We need a new political architecture for relations between the European Union and Africa; one that matches the urgency of the shared challenges we face.
The Middle East is part of Europe's close neighbourhood, and its challenges resonate deeply with people in Ireland.
The conflicts in Syria and Yemen have caused untold suffering. Ireland has responded generously to these crises with almost 100 million in humanitarian aid but what the people of Syria and Yemen need most now is peace, to enable them to rebuild their lives. I urge all sides to the two conflicts to work for an end to violence, to engage in the search for peaceful political solutions under UN auspices and for accountability for crimes committed.
Ireland is committed to constructive and principled diplomatic action on the Middle East Peace Process. Next year it will be 25 years since the Oslo Accords were signed. We cannot let ourselves become complacent about the status quo, or let efforts to achieve peace stagnate. This situation is weighing heavily on both communities. Palestinians need an end to occupation, and Israelis need security. Continued construction of settlements undelmines the prospects for both. I wish the US efforts every success as they seek to build momentum for peace. Ireland is prepared to give all the support we can to achieving a Two State Solution, which we remain

convinced is the only way to ensure security and prosperity for both peoples, Israeli and Palestinian. The time to act on this is now. We cannot become cynical or jaded. We owe it to all Palestinians and Israelis to continue to bring energy and resolve to help them to finally deliver peace and a Two State solution.
In relation to Myanmar Ireland strongly condemns the violence in Rakhine State which has driven hundreds of thousands from their homes into neighbouring Bangladesh. Here at the General Assembly we have to insist on the suspension of military activity; an end to violence; be upholding of the rule of law and the recognition of the right of return of all those who have had to leave the country.
President Ireland sees itself as a natural child of the UN. We are small. We are an island which has experienced colonisation and conflict. Here at the UN, we listen to others - especially if we hold a different view on an issue or policy. We are convinced that in today's globalised world we
must live in each other's shelter not shadow.
Ireland's contribution to the UN in the fields of sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, disarmament, human rights and the rule of law has been steadfast. UN membership has been, and will continue to be, at the very heart of Irish foreign policy.
Ireland is proud to be a candidate for a seat on the UN Security Council at the elections to be held in 2020. We have presented our candidature because we believe deeply that we should step forward and play our part in support of multilateralism at this time of significant global instability and realignment of geopolitical influence. We have something to say and we will listen to you when you speak. We will be courageous on behalf of the UN and our fellow peoples. With Ireland, you know what you get - a small State with big thinking, a country that listens, and a strong independent voice that promotes the values that inspire this organisation.
Thank you."
Italy,"Mr. President, Secretary-General, my fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen,
The opening of the 72nd session of the General Assembly is taking place in a complex and constantly-moving global context. The socio-economic effects of globalization, which can create hardship and inequalities, also compound the persistence of major instability in the international geopolitical framework, which is at the root of multiple crisis situations.
The provocations of North Korea--which Italy condemns in no uncertain terms--threaten regional and international security and pose a real challenge to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and the United Nations system.
The uncertainties and fears of our citizens are heightened, moreover, by the plague of terrorism, which is being fought with growing effectiveness but has certainly not been defeated, and climate change, which risks jeopardizing the future of our planet and the fate of future generations.
 The desperation of migrants and refugees, victims of ruthless criminal trafficking, continues to unfold before our eyes.
These are enormous challenges from which no Country is immune and against which there is an inevitable temptation to seek refuge in isolationism, racism and intolerance.
But it is precisely in the face of extraordinary challenges that the international community must find a way to overcome the most arduous obstacles, and look to the future with confidence.
There is hope to be found in the signs of optimism that accompany the recovery of our economies. At the global level the number of people who live in absolute poverty has greatly declined and
1

technological innovation, often accused of abetting economic crises, has on the contrary paved the way to new opportunities.
 It is up to us to guide this road to development with responsibility and courage. We must do so first through better governance of global processes, to assure robust and inclusive economic growth aimed primarily at reducing inequalities.
e Italy is convinced that building democratic, pluralistic, and inclusive societies open to diversity is not only an ethical imperative but also a guarantee of peace and stability and, as such, a fundamental piece of a broader commitment to promoting and guaranteeing effective protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of each individual.
 This framework is also the basis of every legitimate aspiration for sustainable economic and social development, whose dividends will be available to all. These goals should be pursued first at the national level, at home. It is in this sense that Italy is deeply committed to safeguarding the legacy of democracy, pluralism, freedom and respect for human rights that is its birthright, and to promote their affirmation at the international level.
O The theme chosen by the President of this General Assembly for the works of the 72nd Session emphasizes the need to focus our actions on people's expectations of the future, correcting the distortions and mistakes produced by globalization.
Q Peace, a Decent Life, and a Sustainable Planet are significantly the same challenges that were at the core of the Italian Presidency of the G7 and that those of us who are here today, the representatives of the peoples of the world, are called on to
address.

 We must join forces in continuing on a historic path that, despite setbacks, leads ultimately to peace, prosperity and inclusiveness.
""The pooling of our social, cultural and administrative experience,"" as Alcide De Gaspaeri stated during the first phase of the European integration project, ""doubles the strength of our national potentialities, and preserves them from all danger of decline, by giving them fresh impetus toward the creation of a still more advanced and still nobler ctvm.,.zau. on.,,1
The shared journey of hopes and gains undertaken by the European Union--which for Italy represents the first, natural dimension of multilateralism--teaches us that in the face of the challenges of our day, we must have the courage to react.
In the past two years the European Union has been forced to abandon its ""climate-controlled"" environment to tackle some of the greatest challenges to have emerged since the post-war period.
It has not been easy. Nor has it been the beginning of the end, which many had feared, but rather an opportunity for a powerful collective reminder of the need to remain united within the European project.
Today I affirm with profound conviction that a new European impetus exists which Italy not only shares but actively promotes. The will to proceed, as one, to bring the European project closer to the needs of citizens, the challenges of economic growth, security, and migration. A project that strengthens the global role of the Union in the world, inspired by multilateralism, free exchange, and respect for rule of law.

What Italy wishes to rebuild with its partners is a Union that can once again give the whole world an example of solidarity, progress, prosperity and effectiveness.
 For Italy the development of social, economic and political inclusiveness, extended also to the labor market, and fighting poverty and marginalization, also means contributing to a more effective management of the challenge of migration. We must respond with compassion, intelligence and vision to the reality of the vast human movements of our days.
 For years Italy has been engaged in operations to rescue and receive migrants. We have saved and continue to save hundreds of thousands of persons who risked drowning in the Mediterranean, true to our ethical and moral imperatives and to the international obligations we have freely undersigned. Italy is and shall remain a welcoming Country, mindful of the inescapable link between the principles of solidarity and security.
To consolidate our action, however, we need a global response to the migratory phenomenon that starts in the European Union and extends to the international community as a whole. Together we must find long-term solutions to a challenge that affects not only us but also every Country as well as future generations.
To continue to affirm and embody the principle of shared and proportionate responsibility, Italy is participating actively in the negotiations that will lead to the adoption of global compacts in the United Nations framework. Our proposal to jointly address the migration phenomenon on a global level is based on three main pillars: investing, protecting and valuing. Investing in support of Countries of origin and transit. Protecting the most vulnerable refugees and migrants, and valuing the many positive aspects and opportunities created by migration.
4

Italy is already the promoter of a true partnership with the African Countries. As I have already had occasion to express and I repeat today with conviction, the future of Europe is in Africa. It is by investing in Africa that we can address the deep causes of migration, first and foremost economic and demographic inequalities.
The integrated, structural approach in which Italy believes is already yielding its first positive results, thanks to the fruitful cooperation initiated with the African Countries of transit and the actions of the main international organizations. We are working with the International Organization for Migration and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to provide assistance to migrants with human rights, assure the protection of refugees fleeing from wars and persecutions, and offer favorable conditions and incentives for their voluntary repatriation and reinsertion in their Countries of origin.
To provide an immediate response to those who need protection, a true solution for the most vulnerable migrants: this is our commitment and our appeal today. It is our duty to intensify efforts to prevent and counter an atrocious, heinous crime such as trafficking in persons, which constitutes a crime against humanity in every respect. We are ready to promote this vision within the United Nations as we are already doing in the European Union.
Protecting the weak and defenseless means investing in our values. Saving the lives of children is also action to save our societies and our future.
Fellow delegates,
For Italy, by virtue of our geography and history, our emphasis on responsible and solidary management of the movements of persons is coupled with an emphasis on the security, stability, sustainable

development and growth of the Mediterranean and of the African continent as a whole.
O All of this in the perspective of the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, in the shared interests of all our Countries and peoples.
o Terrorism has sadly continued to claim innocent victims in many Countries in the world in 2017. To address and finally defeat this scourge requires time, courage and unity of intent.
o The increasingly apparent loss of ground for Daesh in Iraq and Syria has demonstrated that together we can do it. It is a step that will enable us to dismantle the ideological and logistical cells of the attacks that have struck Europe, Asia, and Africa.
o But victory on the ground is not enough. The fanaticism and ideology of Daesh continue to claim victims and sow terror in our cities.
o Italy is an active partner in the Global Coalition against Daesh, engaged on the ground in various activities: rehabilitating a fundamental infrastructure such as the Mosul Dike; and training thousands of members of the Iraqi special forces and Kurdish units, as well as federal and local police forces, who represent one of the keys to the future stabilization of liberated zones and to the safe reentry of thousands of IDPs to their homelands. We need to restore the future for the Iraqi people.
O But the fight against terrorism requires a multidimensional force, with recourse to every possible instrument of international cooperation. I am thinking, for example, of initiatives to counter the use of the Internet and social media by terrorists Oust this morning I co-chaired an important event on this issue with my

colleagues Macron and May), or the financing of terrorist groups, who do not hesitate to loot and destroy cultural heritage.
No one, I repeat, can go it alone. It is an absolute prerequisite to have collaboration between state and regional stakeholders, in particular, the European Union and its Member States; the States on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, the Sahel and SubSaharan Africa, and the African Union.
Italy has dedicated great energy in the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the G7 Presidency, to upgrading our capacities to respond to the ever-evolving new threats posed by terrorist groups.
Libya is the key to restoring to the Central Mediterranean its historic role as a driver of civilization, peace and security. Its stabilization is a priority objective that we must achieve through an inclusive dialogue in the framework of the Political Agreement, rejecting unrealistic hypotheses of a military solution.
Italy is a leader in this commitment and in supporting the United Nations' action to strengthen its presence in Libya, which is being pursued with determination by Secretary-General Guterres and Special Representative Salami. There will be no stability in Libya until the value of a truly inclusive path to reconciliation has been embraced, a path that we as the international community must support with a single voice.
It is the people of Libya themselves who are asking for a stable, solid and secure Libya. This is why we stand alongside President Serraj and the institutions provided for by the Political Agreement. We are convinced that it is only through more authoritative Libyan institutions that we shall also be able to address the tragedy of human trafficking.

o We believe it is essential to support Libya also because of its strategic role in the migratory route across the Central Mediterranean. To this end, we must help local communities to foster their development, also through economic investments that create alternate livelihoods to illegal trafficking. We must work with the UNHCR and IOM to foster reception and repatriation.
 Syria continues to be a source of concern and suffering. After six years of unspeakable violence, millions of refugees and hundreds of thousands of deaths, we welcome the recent efforts to promote local truces and de-escalation zones.
 But there are still too many innocent children, women and men who have a limited or no access to humanitarian aid. This is the greatest challenge we must face today.
 The only road to a lasting solution to the Syrian conflict is a realistic and credible political process. There can be no stability, peace and reconstruction, nor a lasting victory over terrorism, or the conditions for voluntary return of refugees in complete security, without an inclusive political transition that brings together the various components of Syrian society.
 This is why I wish to reaffirm today Italy's full support for the UN and for Special Envoy de Mistura, and at the same time urge crucial support from the main regional and international stakeholders for the roadmap outlined by resolution 2254. It is only through a cohesive commitment of the international community that we can arrive at a true political solution that preserves the unity, integrity and sovereignty of Syria.
 Ultimately, there can be no true peace without justice. This means ascertaining the responsibilities of those who have committed atrocity crimes in these years, starting with the use of chemical
weapons.

 Dialogue and reconciliation are indispensable instruments for a lasting peace also on the African continent.
 Italy has intensified and systematized its actions for the Sahel region, particularly for Niger, Chad, and Mali, who are working with immense difficulty to fight terrorist and criminal organizations and the illegal trafficking linked to them, starting with the heinous trafficking in persons.
 The strategy supported by the EU and its main Member States combines initiatives in support of the governments of the region and the fight against terrorism; an immediate action to combat traffickers in human beings and welcome persons who have the right to international protection; and mid-to-long term actions to support the economic development of African Countries. The results are starting to be felt, thanks especially to the work of the governments of the Sahel Countries, whom I wish to thank for being an active part of this positive alliance.
In this context we are convinced that the G5 Sahel initiative is essential to effective control of these phenomena, and we welcomed the decision of the G5 Sahel Countries to launch a common force, with the support of the African Union.
 Italy continues to assure the maximum support for the Horn of Africa, the key to stability for the entire region and prey to a long and complex state of crisis, aggravated, sadly, by a devastating drought produced by climate change.
The strategic goal, once again, is to create the conditions for lasting security and development, which together constitute the only way to defeat the grave transnational threats of violent extremism, terrorism, illegal trafficking and piracy.
9

In this sense, the positive developments in Somalia are moving in the right direction. Italy will continue to support the new Somalian leadership in the important tasks of completing electoral processes, good governance, especially of the territories taken from alShabab, strengthening their security capacities, and prosecuting the fight against terrorism in the Country.
0 I would be remiss if I did not express our deep concern over the very serious situation in Venezuela. Italy reiterates its appeal for immediate and good-faith dialogue, which cannot disregard the four conditions set [by the Holy See]: authorization to send international assistance, a clearly-established electoral calendar, restoration to the Parliament of its prerogatives, and the release of all political prisoners.
o The unprecedented situation that has been created requires a firm and cohesive response from the international community. We are engaged along these lines in the European framework, but we believe it is fundamental for the whole international community to be mobilized, including the traditional allies of Venezuela, for the sake of the Country and its stability, to enable the start of a political path based on dialogue.
O We are extremely concerned by the situation on the Korean peninsula. In the face of repeated violations of the pertinent Security Council resolutions by North Korea, it is fundamental for the international community to remain unified and determined in its response, and it is in this spirit that we promoted, as President of the G7, a firm Group Declaration.
 Full implementation of the pertinent Security Council resolutions--including the most recent one on September 11, in which the Council unanimously adopted strict new sanctions on Pyongyang--is crucial. Italy contributed to this strong message to
10

North Korea, which must immediately end its missile and nuclear proliferation and all provocative actions.
We are ready to cooperate with our partners in continuing to exercise diplomatic and economic pressure on the North Korean regime, always mindful that sanctions must be an instrument of a broader strategy, aiming for a final peaceful solution to the situation on the Korean peninsula and in the whole region.
With reference to the Iranian nuclear file, we believe that the international community should assure that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) remains a success story in the framework of global efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, we are convinced of the importance of a full and comprehensive application of Security Council resolution 2231.
In this regard, we note with satisfaction that the IAEA has confirmed Iran's continued fulfillment of its commitments under the JCPoA. We are committed to continuing our support for the IAEA in the conduct of its work of reliable verification.
Fellow Delegates,
 Autocratic regimes, terrorism, and international crises are a grave threat to world peace.
But we, we who are the United Nations, cannot and will not give up. The Secretary-General has made prevention one of his highest priorities and Italy is with him in this.
We need to prevent conflicts, and the natural disasters and humanitarian and migratory crises that follow, which in turn are the cause of further instability.
11

 Prevention does not mean building barriers: It means achieving inclusive and sustainable development.
Q Agenda 2030 outlines a common pathway with clear-sighted ambition. Together we have written the prescription. Now we have to follow through on it.
Italy is committed to doing its part with policies that strengthen cohesiveness, reduce inequalities, and safeguard the environment. Through our Cooperation, we support other Countries, in particular the African Countries, on this path.
In keeping fully with Agenda 2030, the G7 leaders in Taormina also committed to stepping up their collective support for food security in sub-Saharan Africa. And, for the first time, the outreach session of the G7 Summit was dedicated to Africa.
The same strong commitment is required from us in the fight against climate change. The Secretary-General reminded us of this a few days ago: ""If we don't deal with climate change now, we are going to ruin many of[our grandchildren's] opportunities to have a positive life.""
o We are fully aware of the challenge posed by climate change. It is a systemic emergency whose social consequences are already tragically evident. Just think of the more than two-hundred million displaced persons between 2008 and 2015 who were forced to leave their homes because of the devastating effects of climate
phenomena.
 This is why we will continue to address our development cooperation polices more and more to the issues of adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. We will do this through bilateral channels but also through the United Nations system, whose role
12

we consider indispensable and irreplaceable to meeting the great challenges to our planet and its inhabitants.
 The crises and challenges of our day can be overcome, and those of the future can be prevented.
We therefore support, with conviction, the instrument of peacekeeping and the principles of ""Sustaining Peace"" and the ""Peace Continuum,"" mindful that a lasting peace can be pursued only through a multidimensional approach during every phase of the peace cycle: from prevention to crisis management (when needed), to post-conflict stabilization up to inclusive pathways of national reconciliation and sustainable development processes.
Italy is strongly committed to each of these phases and will continue to be with conviction and concrete action. On the ground we will continue in particular our engagement with UNIFIL and alongside the Lebanese government, as well as in all the theaters in which Italy is present in defense and stability.
Fellow delegates,
We need a United Nations that is more effective and efficient in enacting the principles that inspired it and that continue to be valid and relevant these many years later.
We are thus counting on the Secretary-General's leadership and we fully support his reform plans, including his commitment to the empowerment of women and girls and the achievement of gender equality, also as a tool to strengthen the efficiency of the Organization.
This renewal framework clearly includes the reform of the United Nations Security Council, which is conferred, ""primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
13

security."" This, too, is one of our priorities, and we will continue to promote a comprehensive and inclusive reform.
O A reform that allows us to make the Security Council more democratic, effective, and representative of the entire membership which has evolved and amplified since the establishment of the United Nations, while the Security Council, its principal organ, has remained essentially unchanged.
Fellow delegates,
The current global scenario calls upon us to respond to many challenges which demonstrate that history did not end a quarter of a century ago, as some had believed.
 We are called upon to constantly renew our endorsement of the values of peace, human rights and democracy.
O In other periods of our history, much more difficult than the one in which we are living, we have seen these values recede. But we know that, also in the most difficult moments, democracy can
revive and grow.
O We know this because, as the American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt stated in 1941, ""Democracy alone has constructed an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life.''2
 Thank you."
Jamaica,"Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet
Mr. President, I am delighted to extend Jamaica's warm congratulations on your election to the
Presidency of this 72nd session of our General Assembly, and to assure you of our support. I am particularly pleased to note your selection of a theme that underscores the
fundamental importance of the ambitious and transformative 2030 Agenda for People, Planet and Prosperity.
Mr. President, As I stand before you today, I express on behalf of the Government and People of
Jamaica, our deepest sympathies and prayers for the families and loved ones of victims of the recent hurricanes, which directly impacted our Caribbean brothers and sisters, as well as the families and loved ones of victims of the recent earthquakes in Mexico, our dear friend from the region.
I am deeply moved by the fact that following the passage of two massive hurricanes, thousands of people across the Caribbean are now forced into a life that is dramatically different from what it was just a few days ago. On behalf of our Caribbean brothers and sisters directly impacted by the hurricanes, we wish to thank those countries and organizations which have given without being asked, and to urge those who have the means to support these countries and their peoples, in this time of urgent need.
Mr. President,
For us in the Caribbean, climate change is not a philosophical concept, or an academic debate. It is an existential issue. It is our reality! It requires urgent and effective action.
We are ever mindful of our responsibility to strengthen our resilience and expedite efforts towards adaptation and mitigation. Yet, our ability to do so is greatly impacted by the new catastrophic events that cause social dislocation and severe misalignment of our economies. The limited resources that we have are dwarfed by the huge sums required to meet recovery and reconstruction measures. How do small states like ours, many already facing adverse debt dynamics, mobilise the financing required to build climate resilient frameworks? To do so, it is imperative that we identify both grant funds and concessionary financing that can support our investment in resilient infrastructure over the long-term. If not, we will continue to be caught in an inescapable cycle of devastation, recovery and reconstruction, until the next natural disaster strikes.
21Pz, ge

While it is essential to attend to the immediate humanitarian needs and reconstruction efforts, we must also urgently address our long term sustainable developmental goals. I urge that in our collective efforts to implement the SDGs we take account of the tremendous challenges faced by vulnerable countries completely knocked off course by external shocks. In such circumstances, the review and follow-up mechanisms associated with the time-bound commitments in the Agenda are rendered meaningless.
We call, therefore, on the UN system to establish a mechanism to provide the requisite support and compensation to vulnerable countries affected by natural disasters, where their implementation of Agenda 2030 and progress towards achieving the SDGs have been derailed as a result of such external shocks.
Mr. President,
In recognition of our vulnerabilities as a small island developing state and the attendant complexities of our status as a middle-income country, Jamaica, is collaborating with Chile on a new initiative, the ""Resilient 20"". It seeks to create an alliance to promote resilience in countries prone to natural disasters, with a focus on middle-income countries.
We also support calls for the development of a climate change vulnerability index to provide a standardized method for characterizing vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change. This would enable international financial institutions and bilateral donors, to better channel financial and technical resources, towards countries most susceptible to loss and damage from climate change.
Mr. President,
Jamaica ratified the Paris Agreement in April 2017 and regards this historic Agreement as critical to efforts to arrest the impact of climate change. Small island developing states were at the forefront of these negotiations and remain engaged in the COP process. It is an inescapable fact that we contribute the least to carbon emissions and yet we bear the brunt of the damage. We implore all Member States to abide by the commitments of the Agreement.
Climate change also poses risks to tourism, which owes its competitiveness to the pristine nature of our environment. Sustainable and inclusive economic growth and job creation are priorities for Jamaica, and tourism plays a critical role in ensuring that they are achieved.
This industry relies heavily on the long-term sustainable investments made by the private sector, both national and international. For this International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, we have sought to increase such investments, create more jobs, promote culture and support community development, while safeguarding the natural environment. This November, in partnership with the World Tourism Organisation and the World Bank Group, Jamaica looks forward to hosting the United Nations World Tourism Organization Conference on Partnerships for Sustainable Tourism, the first time such a Conference is being held in the Caribbean.
31

Mr. President,
Jamaica is deeply concerned about the heightened menace to international peace and security, arising particularly from the threat of nuclear weapons. We have had a longstanding commitment to the goal of achieving a nuclear-weapons-free world, and are a State Party to the Treaty of Ttatelolco, which declared the Caribbean and Latin America as the first nuclear weapon-free zone in a densely populated area. At the universal level, therefore, we welcome the fact that we now have f the first global Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, as a critical step towards addressing some of these concerns. It is our hope that it will enter into force in short order and will be duly observed universally.
As global citizens starkly aware of how closely our futures are intertwined, we condemn the recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which pose a grave threat to international peace and security. We urge North Korea to immediately and fully comply with its international obligations under all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and to resume dialogue on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
The challenges that currently impede global peace and security, require that we identify and address the root causes of conflict. We, therefore, fully support the focus placed by the Secretary-General on sustaining peace across the continuum: from prevention, conflict resolution and peacekeeping, to peace-building and long-term development.
In Jamaica, we are working to provide our citizens with a safe and secure environment in which to live full and productive lives. Our strategy includes placing greater emphasis on securing our porous borders, through which illicit firearms enter. Jamaica has benefitted from the support of our international partners and we invite continued collaboration in stemming this illicit trade. We, therefore, look forward to the Third Review Conference of the UN Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons to be convened in 2018. Furthermore, Jamaica will continue to play its part in supporting the universalisation and implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty.
Mr. President,
People and their well-being are at the heart of our commitment to the sustainable development agenda. We remain focused on the most vulnerable of our citizens, to ensure that those furthest behind will benefit first from the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The alignment between the SDGs and our National Development Plan, 'Vision 2030', creates a framework within which we can identify and achieve our priorities, not least of which is to ensure the dignity of the individual.
41?ge

What has become increasingly evident, however, is that securing the resources for the implementation of these development objectives remains critical, both at the national and global levels.
In recognition of this fact, Jamaica has partnered with Canada to identify new and innovative means of financing development. Through the Group of Friends on Financing the SDGs, which our countries co-chair, we have been promoting the establishment of partnerships with the private sector, philanthropic organisations and academic institutions. We are exploring innovative financial mechanisms that can spur the investments needed to accelerate implementation of the SDGs.
Issues related to global economic governance, debt sustainability and SDG financing take on even more significance for highly indebted middle-income countries like Jamaica, which have large public investment needs, but limited fiscal space. Our reduced access to concessionary finance and Official Development Assistance is a direct consequence of our middle-income designation. We contend that the use of GDP per capita as the sole criteria to graduate countries such as ours from concessionary finance, represents an inadequate and inaccurate measure of a country's true development status.
Accordingly, middle-income countries face the risk of having their hard-won socioeconomic gains reversed as a result of losing well-needed financial support, precisely at the time they need to consolidate and build on the gains they have made. We, therefore, commend and thank those, including the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Commonwealth Secretariat, who advocate for the application of a broader set of indicators that take account of the structural gaps in our countries. From a global perspective, it is important that the international economic and financial architecture is aligned with Agenda 2030 and takes account of this very important distinction. Jamaica, therefore, urges that policy makers embed the SDGs into their design of international regulatory frameworks.
Mr. President,
Jamaica looks forward to the convening later this year of the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires, which brings with it the potential for advancing the Doha Development Agenda. As a small island developing state with an open economy highly reliant on foreign trade, we are dependent on a vibrant and dynamic global trading environment. We must secure improved market opportunities beyond our shores.
Mr. President,
We cannot, however, participate in the international economic and trading system, without correspondent banking relations. Several international banks have withdrawn correspondent banking services from many small countries, such as those in the Caribbean. This in an effort to de-risk their client portfolios in response to stringent regulatory penalties for compliance breaches. However, what is viewed by international banks as a balance sheet issue, has caused unintended negative spill-over effects for countries in the Caribbean, with serious political and economic consequences. We, call for urgent international attention to be given to this deepening crisis.
51Pe

Mr. President,
I now turn to the issue of non-communicable diseases, which exact a high socioeconomic and developmental cost on all countries, but disproportionately so in Small Island Developing States. Jamaica agrees that an effective response to this global pandemic is best addressed through multi-stakeholder partnerships, in a comprehensive whole-of-government response. We are firmly on this path. Jamaica is addressing NCDs by promoting healthy lifestyles from birth, increasing awareness of NCDs and encouraging physical activity across the country. We are also strengthening our policy and regulatory frameworks to address obesity and other risk factors.
Such efforts should be complemented by action taken at the global level, and we therefore, look forward to the 2018 High-Level Meeting on NCDs and reiterate the call for greater access, by developing countries, to the findings of modern research and technology.
Mr. President,
Jamaica is committed to the empowerment of women and girls, as well as young people. We have revitalized our National Youth Parliament and have created the National Youth Advisory Council to ensure that young people have a voice at policy-making levels in our country. We are strengthening our legislative and policy frameworks to address violence against women and girls and to foster economic opportunities. We will also protect our children from abuse by maintaining vigilance with respect to new and emerging threats, such as cyber-bullying and sexual exploitation online.
Earlier this year, Jamaica became a party to The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and enacted legislation for its implementation. As we strengthen our national institutional framework to address trafficking in children, we also look forward to participating in next week's High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Appraisal of the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.
V,
Mr. President,
The movement of peoples across borders is a natural phenomenon. Migrants are an asset to both their countries of destination and countries of origin. Jamaica highly values the contribution that our Diaspora makes to national development and to the development of their host countries. We are actively working on strategies to deepen our engagement.
Consistent with a renewed focus to place people at the centre of sustainable development, we must not forget the plight of the refugees and persons displaced by conflict and natural disasters - occurrences not of their own making. Against this background, the ongoing deliberations on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration take on even more significance as we move to the intergovernmental negotiations phase during this session of the General Assembly.
61Pge

Mr. President
Jamaica's adherence to the principles of the United Nations is rooted in a belief in multilateralism, and the benefits we derive from cooperation and collaboration. The most intractable disputes require us to engage collectively in the search for lasting and meaningful solutions.
In this regard, we reiterate our call for an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. This unjust embargo has restricted the ability of a hardworking and self-reliant people to engage in legitimate trade, to travel, and to undertake international financial transactions.
Turning to the Middle East, we continue to believe that the best solution to the IsraeliPalestinian crisis rests in a negotiated political settlement based on a just, lasting and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the security of Israel and provides for a Palestinian State within internationally recognised borders.
With respect to the Situation Concerning Western Sahara, we recall the Security Council's appeal to all parties to show realism and a spirit of compromise to move the negotiations forward. Jamaica, therefore, supports the re-launching of the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations, leading to the resumption of a process with the aim of reaching a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution.
Mr. President,
Our collective efforts in all these political, economic and social areas will be dependent on an effective and dynamic United Nations. Jamaica, therefore, supports reforms that improve coordination, enhance coherence and strengthen the effectiveness of the Organisation. Reform measures must ensure that the UN remains connected to the people it seeks to serve and must be informed by the realities on the ground in programme countries. They should advance all three key pillars of the work of the UN - peace and security, development and the promotion of human rights. A renewed and revitalised UN reform effort will allow us to fully reap the benefits of multilateralism.
Mr. President,
I conclude by reiterating Jamaica's unfailing belief in our ability as a community of nations, whose destiny and prosperity are intertwined, to make a difference in the lives of every human being. I, therefore, encourage us all to be bold and unrelenting in our quest to make this world a better place - leaving no one behind. Let us go forward with the conviction that we can achieve peace and prosperity for our Peoples and protect our Planet for the benefit of future generations."
Japan,"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
Today, I had intended first of all to tell you of the sincerity with which Japan is implementing the SDGs. I also had hoped to introduce to you the innovative ways by which we have been fostering public awareness withinJapan towards those
goals.
I wanted to tell you why the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, or ""We-Fi,"" is important to me personally as well as to the Government ofJapan.
I have been saying we will make universal health coverage part of the ""Japan brand.""We will hold a major conference this December in Tokyo taking up UHC
as the theme.
The list of things I would have liked to raise here is long indeed - our
contributions towards the rule of law; our determination to undertake the Paris
Agreement in a steadfast manner; our policy of addressing global infrastructure
demand through quality investments.
Moreover, what Japan wants to safeguard in every respect is the free, liberal, open
international order and multilateral frameworks.
The world certainly holds high expectations towards the UN as the flag bearer upholding these. That is exactly why the Security Council should be reformed without delay, in response to the demands of the times.
Japan will strive together with its friends to achieve these reforms. I had intended to state that Japan^ abiding determination is to play an active role for world peace as a permanent member of the Security Council.
However, I have no choice but to focus my remarks on a single issue, that ofNorth
Korea.

2. Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, North Korea conducted a nuclear test on September the 3id.Whether or not it was
a hydrogen bomb test, its scale far exceeded that of previous tests. Both before and after that, on August 29, and again on September 15 before the ink on Resolution 2375, passed by the Security Council to impose sanctions on North Korea, was even dry. North Korea launched missiles. Both of these were launched to fly over Japan and make a display of their cruising
range.
The gravity of this threat is unprecedented. It is indisputably a matter of urgency. North Korea is attempting to dismiss with a smirk the efforts towards disarmament
we have assiduously undertaken over the years.
The non-proliferation regime is about to suffer a serious blow from its most
confident disrupter ever. Mr. President, distinguished colleagues. This recent crisis is of an altogether different dimension qualitatively than those we have eluded every time some dictator has attempted to acquire weapons of
mass destruction.
North Korea's nuclear weapons either already are, or are on the verge of becoming, hydrogen bombs. Their means of delivery will sooner or later be ICBMs. Over the more than 20 years since the end of the Cold War, where and when else, and to what dictators, have we allowed such self-indulgence? As it turns out, it is only towards North Korea that this has been allowed.
That is the reality we find before us. And, it was absolutely not a lack of dialogue that gave rise to this situation.


Dialogue dissuaded North Korea from pursuing its nuclear ambitions. Dialogue has afforded many of us the relief that the world had been saved from a crisis. Believing thus, many of us have felt relieved, well, not just once, but twice.
The first time was in the early 1990s.
At the time, the threat that North Korea imposed amounted to little more than
openly displaying its withdrawal from the IAEA and other inspection regimes. However, tensions were felt by those of us who surmised the intent of that. After many twists and turns, in October 1994, what is known as the ""Agreed
Framework"" was realized between the US. and North Korea.
Under the framework. North Korea would be made to abandon its nuclear plans. In exchange, we would provide incentives to North Korea.
Towards that end, Japan, the U.S., and the ROK formed the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, or ""KEDO,"" in March the following year. Taking KEDO as the implementing agent, we pledged to build and hand over two light-water reactors (LWRs) to North Korea and also provide 500 thousand tons of heavy fuel oil annually as a stopgap measure for its energy demand.
This was all carried out accordingly. However, as time went by, it came to be known that North Korea had been continuing steadily with its uranium
enrichment.
From the start. North Korea had never intended to abandon its nuclear ambitions. This had become readily apparent to aU. After 2002, seven years after it was founded, KEDO suspended its operations. During that period, it can be said that North Korea defrauded the U.S., the ROK, and Japan of assistance.

Countries that recognized value in the KEDO framework of providing incentives to change North Korea's actions gradually came to join KEDO --the European
Union, New Zealand,Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Chile, Argentina, Poland, the Czech Republic and Uzbekistan.
North Korea betrayed the good faith of all those KEDO members.
As one of the organization's founding members, Japan had pledged to give a non-interest loan to KEDO and had fulfilled roughly 40 percent of that.
The pledged amount was 1 billion US dollars, with about 400 million fulfilled.
4-
The second crisis occurred in 2002 when KEDO suspended its operations and North Korea, saying it would end the freeze on its nuclear-related facilities, expelled IAEA inspectors.
The concern was again that North Korea was continuing its uranium enrichment. And again we chose the path of defusing the situation through dialogue.
North Korea, China, and Russia joined the three founding members of KEDO, Japan, the U.S., and the ROK, to launch the Six-PartyTalks.That was in August 2003.
Subsequently, after two years of twists and turns, through the summer of 2005 into
the fall, the Six Parties once reached an agreement, resulting in the release of a joint statement.
North Korea committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning to the NPT and to IAEA safeguards.
Moreover, two years after that, in February 2007, an agreement was concluded regarding what each of the Six Parties should do towards implementing the joint
statement.
A group of IAEA inspectors that had entered North Korea verified the shutdown of the nuclear-related facilities in Yongbyon, and in return. North Korea received
heavy fuel oil.

The series of events made people think that tenaciously continuing dialogue had this time finally caused North Korea to change its actions.
But what actually happened?
In February 2005, while the Six-Party Talks were underway, North Korea declared unilaterally that it was already in possession of nuclear weapons. Moreover, in October 2006, it openly carried out its first nuclear test.
Its second nuclear test was in 2009. Ultimately that same year. North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Six-Party Talks, stating it will ""never again take part in such talks.""
Furthermore, around this time it was firing ballistic missiles on a repeated basis.
5-
Mr. President, distinguished colleagues,
Over the course of more than a decade beginning in 1994, the international community continued its efforts towards dialogue with North Korea with great perseverance, first through the Agreed Framework, and later through the Six-Party Talks.
However, what we had to learn is that during the time this dialogue continued. North Korea had no intention whatsoever of abandoning its nuclear or missile development.
For North Korea, dialogue was instead the best means of deceiving us and buying
time.
More than anything else, the following fact demonstrates that.
In 1994, North Korea had no nuclear weapons and even its ballistic missile technology was far from mature.Yet it is now working to attain hydrogen bombs
and ICBMs.
Again and again, attempts to resolve issues through dialogue have all come to naught.

In what hope of success are we now repeating the very same failure a third time? We must make North Korea abandon all nuclear and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner. What is needed to do that is not dialogue, but pressure.
6.
Mr. President, distinguished colleagues. On November 15, already 40 years will have passed since a 13-year-old girl named Megumi Yokota was abducted by North Korea. Megumi and many other Japanese remain abducted in North Korea even to this day. I will continue to do all possible efforts so they can set foot on Japan's soil as soon as possible, until the day when they will finally be in the arms of their parents, and their family members. Japan will face up to North Korean nuclear and missile threat through the Japan-U.S.Alliance and through Japan, the U.S. and the ROK acting in unity. We consistently support the stance of the United States: that ""all options are on the
table.""
Also, I appreciate the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of UNSC Resolution 2375 on September 11, which imposes strict sanctions against North
Korea.
That clarified our intention to further intensify pressure on North Korea in order to force it to undertake a fundamental change in its path forward. But I must make an appeal to you. North Korea has already demonstrated its disregard of the resolution by launching yet another missile. The resolution is nothing more than the beginning.

We must prevent the goods, funds, people, and technology necessary for nuclear and missile development from heading to North Korea. We must make North Korea comply fully with the repeated resolutions. We must ensure the strict and full implementation of the series of Security Council resolutions by all UN member nations. What is necessary is action. Whether or not we can put an end to the provocations by North Korea is dependent upon the solidarity of the international community.
There is not much time left.
7-
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. North Korea is in a truly fortunate location, adjoining the growth region ofAsia and the Pacific. It has an industrious labor force as well as underground
resources.
If it were to make use of those, there could be a path towards North Korea dramatically growing its economy and improving public welfare. That is where North Korea's bright future lies. By failing to resolve the abduction, nuclear weapons and missiles issues, and by becoming a threat to all humanity, there is absolutely no future that North Korea can open up for itself. In order to change North Korea's policies, we must strengthen our unity. Thank you very much."
Jordan,"In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate
Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary General,
Distinguished Heads of Delegation,
Your Excellencies,
I am honored today to speak on behalf of His Majesty King Abdullah II and the people of Jordan.
President Laj(fik, I bring Jordan's sincere congratulations on your election and our commitment to the work of this General Assembly. To Secretary General Guterres, I extend my country's great appreciation for your partnership with our people.
Distinguished Members of the General Assembly,
Two years ago, I had the chance to advocate on behalf of my generation, and chair a United Nations Security Council meeting to adopt the first resolution on youth. Our joint efforts resulted in the historic, unanimous adoption of Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security, aimed at empowering young people to participate in peace processes and dispute resolution.
Today, I stand before you as a representative of my beloved Jordan, but also as a member of the largest generation of young people in history.
Like every other generation, we have inherited the collective wisdom and values of our elders. And like others before us, we must often struggle to reconcile them with our reality today. What that reality is, is unprecedented.
Ours is a world at an epic intersection, driven by the confluence of deepened globalization and disruptive technologies. We are at the brink of a fourth industrial

revolution, which is redefining how we function as societies and how we relate to one another as human beings. Our hyper-connected world is at once bringing people closer together and widening the divisions between them.
Amid all this, the young people of my generation are asking: what are the values that anchor global citizenship today? In which direction does our collective moral compass point, and can it guide us safely to justice, prosperity and peace for
all?
Too often, people of my generation are labeled as dreamers. Yet, we all know that every great deed was born a dream. We are often dismissed as idealists, but ideMism i.q nat frmlish: it is fearless. It invigorates us to lift our reality to the level of our higher ideals, not compromise our ideals in the face of adversity.
So I humbly ask you to indulge me, as I try, on behalf of my generation, to sharpen the contours of our foggy terrain, to put forward some rudimentary questions, unfettered by the political decorum that I know I will acquire with time. I will use my country Jordan as a launch-pad for these thoughts and questions, as I believe it is a true embodiment of what is so right and yet so wrong with our world today.
Throughout its history, Jordan has suffered external shock after external shock, but the last couple of decades have been relentless. We are currently bordered by a number of conflicts. Over the years, there have been wars in Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen and worsening prospects for peace in the PalestinianIsraeli conflict. Jordan has also had to weather the global financial crisis and the energy crises.
All this has affected us in very real and felt ways. Our largest export market, Iraq, was completely shut off. Trade with Syria came to a halt, and we lost critical trade routes from Europe and Turkey. Despite our best efforts, regional instability has undermined tourism and investment.
I do not know of any other country in recent history that has gone through such an onslaught of crises and found itself surrounded by so many conflicts through no fault of its own.
And it doesn't stop there. My country--a resource-poor nation in a conflictrich region--is host to 1.3 million Syrian refugees. Add to that millions of Palestinian refugees and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, as well as others from

Libya and Yemen: Jordan, today, is one of the largest hosts of refugees in the world.
The direct cost of the Syria crisis now consumes more than a quarter of our budget. Its ripple effects are felt across local communities, where 90 percent of Syrian refugees live. Housing, food, energy, healthcare, education, jobs: all are under pressure.
Yet in the face of these daunting challenges, we did not back down from our ideals, or our values. We did not turn our backs on people in need. We're weighed down by massive debt, yet we stand tall and proud. Our soldiers dodge bullets to let refugees into our countw, not keep them out.
Nor did we falter in our reform efforts, difficult as some of them have been on our people. On the contrary, the heavier our burden got, the more forcefully we forged ahead. Don't get me wrong; we are not perfect. To bring down unemployment and create the jobs needed for youth and future generations, we need to drastically improve our investment climate; enhance integrity and accountability; advance our education system and support young entrepreneurs. Ordinarily, assistance would be tied to our progress. But these are extraordinary times, and aid is a necessary runway if our political and economic reforms are to fully take off.
Difficult circumstances did not stop Jordan from being a net contributor to global good.
We have remained steadfast in our commitment to a just and peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the two-state solution, despite prevailing skepticism.
We have staunchly upheld our duty as Hashemite Custodians of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem. Preserving the historical and legal status quo at A1 Aqsa Mosque/A1 Haram A1 Sharif is key to peace in our region and the world, as Jerusalem is the cradle of all three monotheistic religions.
We have been unwavering in the international war against terrorism and our promotion of the true values of Islam. Our peacekeeping troops have protected innocent civilians from Haiti to Darfur to East Timor; and our calls for inclusiveness and moderation ring loud in a region too often deafened by division and extremism.

We have done the right thing, over and over again, because that is what real integrity means, but how has the world reacted?
No doubt, Jordan is regularly praised for its humanitarian and moral stance, and we are proud of our country's reputation, but kind words don't balance budgets, build schools or bolster employment.
For the people and youth of Jordan, important questions linger:
How can it be that a country as small as ours struggles in the face of such crushing adversity, only to be told that its friends are suffering from donor fatigue? Financial institutions often remind us that on a per catita basis, we are a top recipient of aid. Yet, on a per capita basis, few countries have endured as many external shocks or contributed to global peace and security as Jordan has.
How can it be, that a country like Jordan offers a humble home to millions of desperate people, while richer countries around the world quibble over accepting thousands?
What does it say about our common humanity, when last year alone the world spent close to 1.7 trillion dollars on arms, but fell short by less than 1.7 billion in fulfilling the UN appeal to support Syrian refugees and host communities in countries like Jordan?
What does it say when trillions are spent waging wars in our region, but little to take our region to safer shores?
There are no good answers.
The sad reality is that war economies are thriving to the benefit of a few, while real economies are suffering to the detriment of all.
The message to the youth of Jordan and our region is loud and clear: there is no shortage of money for fighting evil, but the appetite for rewarding virtue is nearly non-existent; that the voice of those who defend and build is drowned out by those who attack and destroy.
It just doesn't add up.
So, what do we telt the people of Jordan? What does the international community tell our young majority?

Do we tell them that the values we live by... are of no value? That pragmatism beats principles? That complacency trumps compassion? Or that we should play it safe; turn our backs on people in need, because we cannot count on others to have our back? The United Nations is our global conscience, but for too many in my country, and others around the world trying to do good, it sometimes feels like the world's conscience is on 'silent' mode. It's time to break the silence and start finding answers. In doing so, we can unleash a global current that carries our common humanity to safer shores. Our commitment to peace, moderation and international cooperation is uncompromising. Water a thirsty fruit-bearing tree or continue to add fuel to a raging fire? The world has a choice to make. Thank you very much.

Kazakhstan,"Focusing on people - striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet .
Mr. President,
 Mr. Secretary-General,
 Ladies and gentlemen,

In his first statement at the United Nations in October 1992 President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev endorsed the concept of preventive diplomacy - the idea which is now very much prioritized by the Secretary General and President of the General Assembly.
This concept has been very instrumental for Kazakhstan, which in 25 years of its independent development has proven to a proactive and responsible member of the international community. My country has become a net contributor to peace, security and stability, economic and social development  not only in the region but far beyond.
We carefully preserved peace and harmony in our multi-ethnic and multi religious society, stressing and enforcing the equality and .dignity of every citizen.
We have achieved this while also creating an efficient economic model  our economy has grown 20-fold and major international corporations have established and strengthened their presence in Kazakhstan by investing more than 265 billion US dollars. This year Kazakhstan achieved 32nd position in the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking - a remarkable rise of 15 places, and 35th ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Index, going 16 places higher.
Looking forward, Kazakhstan has a clear vision for its future development. By 2050 we seek to become one of the top thirty most competitive economies in the world, meeting the most advanced global standards in terms of economic performance and transparent governance, especially those of the OECD.

2

A new model of economic growth , the Third Modernization of Kazakhstan , announced by President Nazarbayev in his annual address earlier this year, outlines the path for our country to achieve those ambitious goals . In economic sphere Third Modernization makes heavy emphasis on the rapid technological modernization of Kazakhstan with focus on new high-tech industries , information and communication technologies as well as massive improvement of the business environment, economic productivity, human development, and institutional reforms.
We have committed resources to streamline and upgrade our road , rail, airport and pipeline infrastructure and ensured effective conjunction between Kazakhstan State Programme Nurly Zhol (the Bright Pass) and Chinese Belt and Road initiative.
With a purpose to build a more efficient, sustainable, modern system of governance, this year, President Nazarbayev initiated a constitutional reform in Kazakhstan. This reform, now well under way, sets the goal of considerably redistributing powers between its three branches and further democratizing the political system as a whole. The key step is the transfer of some presidential powers to the Parliament and the Government and strengthening of a genuine system of checks and balances.
These processes of economic and political modernization will be accompanied by our quest for a modernization of . Kazakhstan's national identity and its own cultural code to create conditions for a new generation of competitive and pragmatic citizens and leaders with a thirst for knowledge, progressive consciousness, and an open attitude.
Mr. President, The agenda of the current session focuses on people, encompassing issues of sustainable development, peace and security, and stresses our common responsibility for the future. No one can ignore tough realities on the ground - lack of trust and unity, global and regional inequality and injustice, poverty, xenophobia, conflicts, terrorism and extremism, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

3

That is why this agenda truly reflects the magnitude of the challenges that the United Nations faces and, at the same time, underlines the undiminished importance of this organization .
Indeed , the UN machinery is subject to criticism and long-awaited reform to enhance its crisis preparedness and response capabilities. But at the same time the UN remains a beacon of hope for billions of people across the globe, a universal institution that brings the promise of better, safer and more sustainable life.
We believe that the UN Secretary General is on the right track in this regard in uniting member states to revitalize the United Nations. We also support convened on September 18 by the United States President Donald Trump a special meeting on UN reform, which we believe will give a fresh incentive to turn our Organization into an effective and efficient tool serving the whole of mankind.
Kazakhstan is actively working on establishing and hosting a UN Regional Hub for multilateral diplomacy in Almaty focusing on sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, disaster risk reduction and resilience building in the region and the wider area. This initiative comes in line with the Secretary General's idea to optimize the service delivery mechanism of the United Nations and to increase the effectiveness of the UN field missions' activities through proper planning and management.
My country persistently pursues the notion of Security-and-Development nexus - the concept that echoes an intrinsic interdependence of peace and security and development. Sustainable development is unimaginable without peace and vice versa. Erosion of security architecture along with regional confrontations and international terrorism undermines the achievements reached within MDGs and jeopardizes the objectives of SDGs. Peace is an integral requirement for social, economic and environmental propulsion .
Mr. President, When we speak of opportunities unfolded by global modernization, we need to bear in mind the dangers that p~event all of us from realizing our potential. In our inter-dependent and connected world, nuclear weapons are

4
no longer an asset but a danger. It is with moral authority and responsibility emanating from my nation's bitter experience of the hundreds of nuclear tests my President states that eliminating the nuclear danger is the most urgent task of humanity in 21 century. It includes a whole range of important and urgent steps - a complete ban on nuclear testing, the total prohibition of nuclear weapons and complete and verifiable destruction of nuclear arsenals.
We are deeply concerned by the nuclear tests conducted by the DPRK  the only state in the 21 st century continuing such tests despite condemnation from the entire international community. I want to specifically stress that the DPRK's actions to further develop its nuclear and missile programs are totally unacceptable and Pyongyang must undertake serious steps to restore trust and re-commit a much needed political settlement.
In 2009 the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted its resolution designating August 29 - the day the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site was officially closed in 1991 by the Decree of President Nazarbayev - as the International Day Against Nuclear Tests. This day has been widely commemorated in Kazakhstan and in the UN from 2010 onwards. This year was also marked by several important events of international significance.
From August 25 to 29 Astana hosted the Conference of the Pugwash Movement of Scientists to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Movement and International Day Against Nuclear Tests, where hundreds of scholars, practitioners and officials from around 50 countries gathered to seek ways of achieving a nuclear-weapons-free world.
The same day , my President and IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano opened the IAEA Low Enriched Uranium Bank Facility in Kazakhstan, with a view to making a significant contribution to the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and strengthening the global nonproliferation regime.
At the opening ceremony President Nazarbayev outlined a number of important initiatives that I would like to share with you.
First, to convene a summit of all states possessing nuclear weapons to collectively discuss further steps towards their nuclear disarmament and attaining nuclear-weapon-free world.

5
Second, to enhance the role of the nuclear weapon free zones as effective instruments to end further nuclear proliferation and to combine efforts of states-members of such zones at the meeting of all nuclear weapons-free zones in Astana.
Third, to renew the process of global nuclear security summits and to host the first recommenced nuclear security summit in Astana.
And fourth, to call for joint efforts to ensure that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons enters into force by 2020 - this is the 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons entering into force.
Mr. President, Our common response to barbaric terrorist actions requires more coordination . Kazakhstan fully supports the efforts of the United Nations , especially the creation of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, with a view to developing a long term comprehensive approach. This goes in line with the proposal by Kazakhstan President set forth in 2015 to jointly establ ish the Global Anti-Terrorist Coalition. My country is looking forward to actively and constructively participating in the first ever meeting of the national counter-terrorism agencies heads next year, to forge a new International Counter-Terrorism Partnership. As practical contribution to the global partnership in fighting against terrorism , my country has initiated to elaborate a Code of conduct for the achievement of a terrorism free world as one of the ways to expedite the work on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. We are also committed to implementation of the UN Global Counter Terrorism Strategy and have recently allocated 300,000 US dollars for its implementation in Central Asia. Kazakhstan advocates for the widest implementation of multilateral mechanisms and instruments to combat foreign terrorist fighters, and to shut down the channels of financial support for their activities through the illegal trade in drugs, natural resources and cultural artifacts.

6

Since there is a wide range of approaches to the issue of controlling Internet content, the United Nations needs to take concerted action to prevent use of the Internet for recruitment, spread of terrorist ideology and radicalization of the population, especially amongst the youth. In Kazakhstan we are working on creating a National ""Cyber Shield"" System.
Mr. President, The unspeakable suffering of millions of people in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen, ongoing humanitarian crises and gross violations of human rights leave none of us indifferent. Kazakhstan is hosting the Astana process on Syria to contribute to the peaceful settlement in Syria and promote UN-led negotiations in Geneva. We believe that the Astana Process, which commenced earlier this year with the support and direct involvement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, has brought obvious positive results aimed at strengthening the ceasefire regime, creation of the de-escalation zones and developing monitoring mechanism. Success in the Geneva and Astana platforms is critical and should be supported by all as saving innocent lives in Syria is a moral imperative for all of us. Kazakhstan has a clear and consistent position on the Middle East Peace Process, based on the two-state solution approach: a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognized borders, side by side in peace with Israel. As an active member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation my country along with other OIC member states strongly protects ideals of dialogue among nations and peoples of diverse religious identity. Recently in Astana we hosted the OIC Summit on Science and Technology on the margins of the International Exhibition EXPO-2017. Although devoted to Science and Technology matters, the Summit meeting was not in a position to ignore the sufferings of the Rohingya community. The OIC member states condemned continued violation and called for dialogue between the UN, OIC and the government of Myanmar to stop the humanitarian crisis. Events in

7
this country once again stressed the relevance of our initiative on the Congress of Leaders of World and Trad itional Religions.
Mr. President, Kazakhstan is fully committed to strengthening and improving United Nations peacekeeping activities and believes that the new approach of the Secretary General on peacekeeping reform with a cross-pillar approach , focusing on prevention and sustaining peace , will result in an increase of the effectiveness and accountability of peacekeeping operations. We are confident that flexibility and partnerships, as well as enabling the active involvement and engagement of new countries could increase the effectiveness of peace operations. Kazakhstan is committed to augmenting its contribution to UN peacekeeping by sending more military observers and staff officers to UN missions. Just recently we declared in the UN Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System the 2nd level of Kazakhstan peacekeeping unit preparedness for deployment to UN peacekeeping missions.
Mr. President, Earlier this year I presented President Nazarbayev's Policy Address to the Security Council. The seven priorities of this document called to ensure humanity's survival through a world free of nuclear weapons by 2045; the prevention and end to military confrontations at regional and global levels ; generating a model for a regional zone of peace, security, cooperation and development in Central Asia. lt calls for global efforts of all stakeholders to combat international terrorism and extremism; promoting peace and security in Africa ; implementing SDGs and working for the reform of the Security Council and the United Nations system. Kazakhstan will assume chairmanship of the Council in January 2018. We are planning to hold high level open debate on global peace and security as the major event during this period . I would like to use this opportunity to extend our invitation to all UN member states to participate in the debate at the highest level.

8

During our presidency particular focus will be attached to the security and stability in Afghanistan and Central Asia through the prism of peaceful economic and political integration of Afghanistan into regional and global processes.
Mr. President, My country remains deeply committed to sustainable development. Reckoning the reality of climate change , Kazakhstan, despite its abundant conventional energy resources, is deeply committed to a green economy through diversifying and developing alternative energy sources. This thinking led us to choose ""Future Energy"" as the theme for the Astana EXPO ' 2017 International Exhibition. Throughout the summer, 115 countries and 22 international organizations showcased their creative experiences. This enormous undertaking is a clear evidence of Kazakhstan's pledge to carry forward the Paris Agreement and Agenda 2030. One the best way to promote green economy and green business we see the use of the heritage of the EXPO infrastructure. With the support of five UN agencies we are establishing the International Centre for Green Technologies and Investment Projects ""Future Energy"". Its activities will be in full compliance with the Kazakhstan ""Green Bridge"" Partnership Programme reflected in the Rio+20 Outcome Document. The EXPO infrastructure will also host the Astana International Financial Center and IT Start-ups Center. As I already mentioned earlier in my statement, we hosted the first ever DIG Summit on Science and Technology within EXPO, an event that underlined the need for technological modernization for the sake of unity, and solidarity of the 1.5 billion strong Islamic world. The high-level meeting attended by 15 presidents and dignitaries from 57 states manifested a clear and undeniable link between security and development and recognized that building a sustainable future for their nations was the only course of action to eradicate challenges and threats to their security. To support the OIC's endeavors, the President of Kazakhstan proposed to create a 15-member OIC forum designed to streamline scientific and economic

9
cooperation. He invited Islamic nations to jointly develop our EXPO legacy in the areas of Islamic finance and green technologies , and established a Prize for Islamic science and innovations.
Mr. President, To conclude, I would like to stress the utmost importance of preserving peace and stability and to ensure the incremental and sustainable development of our fragile world. We don't have the luxury of being able to make mistakes and then going back to correct them. We call on all world leaders to redouble their efforts and goodwill to head towards lasting peace and prosperity for all.
I thank you."
Kiribati,"Mr. President Secretary General Antonio Guterres Excellencies Heads of delegations Distinguished delegates Secretariat team Observers Members of civil society and private sector Members of the media Ladies and gentlemen
I bring warm greetings from the Government and the people of the Republic of Kiribati on whose behalf I am very honored and humbled to address this august gathering. In our traditional way and in the Lord's name, I share with you blessings and peace.
Acknowledgement
Mr. President
I join previous speakers in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly. You have an important responsibility to chart and lead the course of our work during this Session. I am confident that under your able leadership we will achieve the goals and targets set for this Session based on the theme ""Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet. Please be assured of our full support and cooperation.
2

I also join others in commending and acknowledging with gratitude and pride the marvelous leadership of your predecessor and our Pacific brother, His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji.
Mr. President
As this is our new Secretary General's first General Debate, I extend to him our heartfelt congratulations on assuming leadership of our organisation and acknowledgement of his unwavering commitment in reforming our organization to make it more inclusive and responsive to global realities facing its members.
Highlight on the Theme
Mr. President
I congratulate you on the theme you have chosen for this Session. It serves as a reminder to us of two of the great wonders of creation: our people; and our planet.
People are the fundamental foundations of our families, our societies, our nations and our planet bound together by strong human values and a strong faith in God. The theme reminds us of our important responsibility, as leaders, to ensure that human lives, human dignity and human values prevail over dollar value. We must make sure we serve and deliver on our main objective as a global family to provide a peaceful and secure world, without nuclear weapons, and to promote social progress, better living standards, human rights and dignity for all our citizens. We all want to live a happy life on a safe and sustainable planet.
Our People
Mr. President
3

As leaders of our sovereign nations, we are responsible to our people who are at the heart of our sustainable development agenda. Every year, we converge in this great Hall from all corners of our planet to represent their voice  to share their triumphs, their tribulations, and to share our vision for them and for our planet. The voice we represent at this august gathering is constant and dominated by messages of trials and challenges at varying degrees of urgency and intensity.
Over the past years, we continue to witness human suffering around the world as a result of armed conflicts, terrorism, persecution, corruption, climate change and natural disaster, to name a few. Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed, through the media, heartbreaking news of loss of lives and extensive devastation in the Caribbean, Mexico and the United States caused by unprecedented continuous onslaught of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria as well as earthquakes. While it wasn't as widely reported as the Hurricanes and earthquake in the Americas, the intense typhoons and monsoons in Asia also caused great human suffering and loss.
On behalf of the people and Government of Kiribati, I offer our heartfelt condolences and our prayers to all victims of these natural tragedies as they try to rebuild their lives after the loss of their loved ones and their homes.
Mr. President
While we deal with human suffering in countries affected by rapid onset disasters, we must not forget the plight of those, like people in Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Maldives and other Small Island Developing States, who continue to suffer on a daily basis from the impact of the slow onset climate disaster. This may not capture the attention of the global community due to its slow impact and limited media attention but it is causing pain and suffering in our communities.
4

During this 72nd Session and in view of our theme, the United Nations must focus on the most vulnerable and underprivileged members of our global family such as the least developed countries and Small Island Developing States. We must provide them with special attention and support to achieve self-sufficiency and enjoy decent and dignified lives. We must make sure they are not left behind in our global journey towards achieving the Global Development Agenda. We must provide a platform on which they can participate meaningfully in international processes that affect their lives. We must make sure their voices are heard.
Mr. President
International processes and systems must be simplified and streamlined to enable enhanced participation and easy access to global resources like the Green Climate Fund. Above all else, human lives and dignity must be protected. We must celebrate and build on the diversity of our people, our rich cultures and values. We must respect each other. We must work together to overcome global challenges and unlock global potential.
Mr. President
Like you, Kiribati also looks forward to a day when we have to tell a different story to our children, and their children's children. A story without heartbreaking human suffering and loss. A story of success and joy. This story must start with major transformation of our homes, our societies, our nations and our world but most importantly, the imminent transformation of our hearts, and our minds, both as leaders and as individuals.
My Government is embarking on an ambitious transformative 20-year Vision for Kiribati (KV20) towards a wealthy, healthy and secure nation based on accelerated growth and strategic investment in our human, natural and cultural capital. Our
5

priority sectors in the immediate term are fisheries and tourism with anticipated boost in our national income levels to help finance our development priorities. The KV20 is underpinned by the principles of good governance and transparency.
Our intervention is targeted at empowering our people at the household and community levels. They are the foundation on which our nation is founded. The stronger the foundation the more resilient and more self-sufficient our nation. My Government has put in place income generation programmes to boost household income levels to address poverty in our society and provide an opportunity for a decent and dignified life for our people.
Our Government policy slogan is to serve and deliver to our people based on the principles of good governance and transparency.. We have established a Parliamentary Select Committee on Anti-Corruption. We have enacted a Leadership Code and put in place necessary regulations and arrangements for the establishment of a Leadership Commission next year. Before I left Kiribati earlier this week, I launched our first ever National Anti-Corruption Strategy covering the public sector, the private sector and civil society.
Nurturing and developing a decent life for all require genuine and inclusive partnership. We cannot talk about focusing on people and creating a decent life for all if our United Nations family is incomplete. Every year, we pledge to consolidate and act together to provide a better life for our people, yet we choose to ignore the 23 million people in Taiwan and deprive them of the right to be part of this global family and to participate and contribute meaningfully to the sustainable development agenda. We call for a reform programme that will see Taiwan included in our global family's efforts and drive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
Our Planet
6

Mr. President
Our planet is struggling to keep up with our greed and demand on it. We are stretching our planet's capacity to dangerous limits. Continuing with unsustainable patterns of production and consumption will push our planet's life support system to the brink of collapse. The warning signs of unprecedented natural events causing despair and havoc in their wake is confirmation of the poor health of our planet.
With lessons learned from the damage we caused on our atmosphere, we must ensure that urgent and collective action for conservation of our ocean is made so that we do not repeat the same mistake we made with our atmosphere. I am encouraged to note item 78 on the agenda of the General Assembly which proposes the formulation of an internationally legally binding instrument for the management and sustainable use of biological marine diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. This is crucial for Kiribati and other countries which rely heavily on revenue from fisheries. A single management failure in any such area or in any other part of the ocean could have devastating consequences not only on the fisheries of a nearby EEZ area but potentially on the fisheries of the entire ocean. The fishing revenue accounts for about 80% of our recurrent budget. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this issue with an ambitious vision that 20 years from now, Kiribati aspires to implement a self-reliance strategy to harvest, process and market its own tuna.
Ocean has a strong connection to the people, peace and prosperity. Kiribati has played its part in the conservation and management of the ocean by declaring 11% of its total Exclusive Economic Zone as a Marine Protected Area, a non-commercial zone and a world heritage entity under UNESCO with an aim to allow a re-stocking of fisheries resources for the future. We have also declared our entire EEZ as a shark sanctuary. If a small resource-constraint nation like mine is willing to make a
7

profound sacrifice of its own economy and a resource to the entire world that its people rely on every day for a living, indeed this global family have a far greater capacity to do more and make sacrifices that focus on people so that our children and their children can build a decent life in a sustainable environment.
Our Response
Mr. President
In spite of all these challenges, we remain steadfast in our strong development aspirations and vision for our people. We require swift global action on climate change. We require support to mitigate and alleviate the suffering of our people. We are grateful for the support of all our development partners in our efforts to address the impact of climate change on our people, in areas such as water and sanitation, and coastal protection of our water resources, our critical public infrastructure and farmland.
Access to climate financing, like the Green Climate Fund, takes too long to process and disburse. The longer the delay in delivering this much needed financing for urgent adaptation, the greater the impact on our people and environment, and the higher the cost.
We simply cannot afford to wait any longer.
As part of my Government's 20-year vision for Kiribati (KV20), we have decided to take charge of our fate and put in place innovative financing modalities. This will allow us to fast-track financing support for our sustainable development agenda, especially in relation to climate change and disaster risk reduction.
8

With the approval of Parliament, my Government is leveraging our sovereign wealth fund as collateral for concessional debt financing. Ideally, Government will be looking at concessional debt financing with an interest rate of 1% to 2% which will be repaid when climate or adaptation financing are available. We currently earn about 6% return on our investment.
This is a move beyond tradition but we would rather take the initiative to drive our own aspirations and deliver to our people than to wait on financial assistance that may come at a moment far too late. Humanity and life must and should not be succumbed to the bureaucratic processes of financial institutions.
Concluding Remarks
As leaders of this global family, we have a moral responsibility to focus on the people we serve, strive for peace and decent life for all and make sure the health of the planet is sustained to continue to support life.
In our quest for sustainable development, we often focus on the economic fundamentals at the expense of human values. For so long, our focus has been diverted from the very purpose of this global family to our individual fight and quest for power, dominance and greed. In the process, we fail to recognize that for some members of this global family, their priority is simply to survive and provide a decent life and future for their children.
The compassion and love that exist within all of us can easily transform our global challenges by focusing on the most vulnerable members of our global family. We contemplate on how we can best find solutions when all we really need is to translate the meaning of family into what it stands for  love, compassion, respect, understanding and kindness. These are priceless solutions to the mounting problems that we continue to battle. We come at this gathering to listen and
9

converse, and let us do so with greater compassion, understanding, love, respect and kindness. It is never too late to start. In closing, I share with you all our heart, our love and our traditional blessing of Te Mauri, Te Raoi ao Te Tabomoa meaning health, peace and prosperity. Kam bati n rabwa, thank you very much and God bless all our people, God bless our UN leadership and family and God bless our planet.

Kuwait,"Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Mr. Secretary-General, Ladies and Gentlemen,
THE PEACE, MERCY AND BLESSINGS OF ALLAH BE UPON YOU
On behalf of the Government and people of the State of Kuwait, it pleases me at the outset, to extend our sincere congratulations to you personally, and your friendly country, the Republic of Slovakia, on your election as President of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would also like to assure you of my country's support in all actions you undertake to facilitate your work and the fulfillment of your responsibilities. We are fully confident that your vast experience in international issues will contribute valuably to the conduct of the work of this session. In addition, ! would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding work of your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thompson, during his capable and successful presidency of the previous session.
Allow me also to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Antbnio Guterres, for the deserved trust he has earned for himself and for his friendly country, the Republic of Portugal, from the international community, embodied by his recent election as Secretary-General of the United Nations, in process of unprecedented transparency in the history of the United Nations. We would like to wish His Excellency success in serving the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as in all endeavors to consolidate peaceful coexistence between nations, maintain international peace and security, and reinforce international cooperation in all fields, inciuding, the follow up of the implementation of the goals and objectives of sustainable development.

In this respect, we would be remiss if we fail to mention the vital and effective role of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, during the past ten years, and the great achievements realized during his tenure, such as the Climate Change Agreement, and the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, and other distinguished accomplishments.
Mr. President,
The State of Kuwait firmly believes in the vital and effective role of the United Nations and its various bodies, agencies and programs, to face up to increasing global challenges and risks. In that light, we welcome the proposals and plans put forward by the Secretary-General to restructure the Secretariat, aimed at making it a more coherent body and promoting its effectiveness and efficacy in ensuring the coordination and streamlining of its activities in the fields of maintaining international peace and security and the follow up of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
We renew our call for the necessity of reforming the Security Council to reflect the new international reality in a manner that would reinforce its representation, credibility and legality, and would also ensure permanent Arab representation commensurate with the number of Arab States and their contribution in supporting the different activities of the United Nations.
What is worrisome are the challenges and risks we are witnessing in different regions of the world, such as the spread of the phenomenon of violence, extremism and terrorism, as well as the risks of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the threat of their use, in addition to the violations of human rights, as currently taking place in Myanmar, of the rights of the Rohingya Muslim minority which we call for the immediate cessation of all acts of prosecution practiced against them, and granting them their rights to citizenship and decent living.
The position of the State of Kuwait in condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is principled & constant. We support all international actions and measures designed to combat terrorism and eliminate all terrorist

organizations. Kuwait also contributes significantly to the provision of logistical support to the international alliance against extremist groups.
The practices of the so called ISIL group undoubtedly violates the most basic principles of human rights and threatens, if not challenged and left with drained resources of funding, to become a real danger to international peace and security.
It is regrettable that the Middle East region has the greater share of challenges with multiple reasons and diversity of means, which makes it imperative that international efforts be combined to meet such dangerous phenomena and concentrate on addressing their root causes, so as the world can enjoy security & stability, due to the fact that such challenges and risks threaten the very essence of international peace and security, and where the majority of the victims are civilians.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The brotherly Republic of Iraq, which is facing significant security, political and economic challenges, the most prominent of which is its confrontation with and combating terrorist organizations and extremist groups that attempt to exploit the Islamic region and distort the Islamic doctrine, to achieve illegitimate goals and objectives, aimed at spreading chaos, wreaking havoc and inciting hatred and extremism.
In this respect, we congratulate the Government and people of lraq on victories that its forces are achieving on the ground in battling ISIL, and on their liberation of numerous areas that were under the control of ISIL. We hope those victories will continue until the total liberation of the remaining areas still under the control of ISIL, thus promoting national reconciliation efforts among the various elements of the Iraqi people, and leading to the restoration of peace and stability in Iraq, and to the maintenance of its unity, independence and territorial integrity, as well as creating the appropriate environment for starting the efforts of rebuilding and reconstruction, and the return of the refugees to their homes.

In this context, and responding to calls to provide humanitarian and development assistance, the State of Kuwait intends, in cooperation and coordination with iraq and the international community, to host an international donors conference during the coming year to rebuild the devastated areas and provide all forms of support to help iraq fulfill all of its remaining obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions, and would help Iraq regain its regional and international role and standing,
Mr. President,
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the occupation of the Palestinian territories in 1967. This the only Arab cause that had been saturated with United Nations resolutions, international and regional initiatives, without ever being implemented, due to the intransigence of the Israeli occupying power, and its explicit and blatant refusal to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy, most recent of which, is Security Council resolution 2334, that confirmed that the Israeli settlement activities are illegal and illegitimate, and called for their cessation, as they undermine the prospects of reaching a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.
The State of Kuwait confirms its condemnation of the Israeli violations that took place lately at AI Haram AI Sharif (AI Aqsa Mosque) in Jerusalem, in a new attempt to alter the existing historical status, and rejects categorically all the illegal Israeli policies, plans and practices that aim for the judaization of the holy city, erase its Arab identity, disrupt its demographic structure, and isolate it from its Palestinian perimeter. Such violations represent a flagrant threat to international peace and security, and are contrary to the relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as the 4th Geneva Convention of 1949.
From this premise, we appeal to the international community and to the Security Council to abide by their responsibilities, and continue to pressure Israel to implement the United Nations resolutions, leading to the attainment of all the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people, and the recognition of their own independent state, over their own territory, with East Jerusalem as its capital, along the borders of 4 June 1967, in accordance with the concept of land for peace, and the Arab Peace Initiative.

Mr. President,
It is regrettable that since the onset of the crisis in Syria, we have been facing horrifying facts and figures of the ongoing conflict, confirming that destruction is the theme of the continuing conflict in Syria, the economic social and humanitarian impact of which can neither be evaluated or calculated, but will unfortunately contribute to the loss of an entire generation of our brothers in Syria. The number of fatalities in this conflict has exceeded 400,000, with nearly 12 million Syrians, who are either displaced or refugees, in addition to massive destruction of property and infrastructure in the majority of provinces.
Proceeding from its moral and humanitarian responsibilities, the State of Kuwait hosted three international donor conferences in 2013, 2014 and 2015, in support of the humanitarian situation in Syria, and co-chaired the 4th international donor conference, held in London in February 2016, as well as the 5th international donor conference held in Brussels, in April 2017. During those conferences, my country's voluntary contributions are estimated to be $1.7 Billion, the bulk of which was given to specialized agencies of the United Nations, and to intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations dealing with humanitarian affairs.
Despite the efforts exerted in both the political and humanitarian tracks of the conflict in Syria, those efforts did not change to a large measure of the reality on the ground, which makes us more aware than ever before, that our convictions and position, correspond to what we had advocated from the beginning, that this crisis cannot be resolved by military means.
The pace of the political track is still slow, and since the issuance of the Communiqu of the first Geneva Conference, over which there were sharp differences in the interpretation of its content, we have witnessed six rounds of Syrian talks in Geneva, over the period of five years between the different parties without achieving any progress; which requires that we intensify the efforts to bring together the parties to the conflict, to hold direct talks aimed at finding a peaceful settlement, in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 2254, leading to the creation of a political reality, which would maintain the unity, independence and sovereignty of Syria, as well as realizing the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.

} f f P ,  .r  , f -. ,<,   I ,  -."" .
Ladies and Gentleman,
The sisterly Republic of Yemen has been experiencing a difficult phase in its history, since the coup by the Houthi militias and the followers of the former President against the legitimate authority, and the refusal of the rebels to implement the resolutions of the Security Council and international initiatives in order to reach a political settlement, the conflict continues to rage on.
In this connection, we would like to reaffirm our full commitment to the unity of Yemen, and the respect of its sovereignty and independence, as well as rejecting any interference in its internal affairs, and asserting the support and backing of the constitutional legitimacy, while stressing that the political solution in Yemen should be based on the three agreed upon references, i.e. the Outcomes of the National Dialogue, the Initiative of the GCC countries and its Implementation Mechanism, as well as relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly, resolution 2216.
The State of Kuwait has exerted significant efforts to peacefully resolve this conflict, and has hosted over a period of three months last year, consultations between the Yemeni parties, under the auspices of the United Nations,
In this regard, we reiterate our readiness to host our Yemeni brethren to sign on a final accord reached among them, and renew our support of the efforts of the United Nations, and of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, to reach a peaceful settlement to this crisis, thus ending the suffering of the Yemeni people who face dire humanitarian and economic conditions.
At the humanitarian level, the State of Kuwait did not overlook the humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people, under the harsh circumstances they face, and continued over the years to provide humanitarian assistance. Kuwait also participated actively in the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, held in Geneva, on 25 April 2017, and pledged during that event to allocate the amount of $100 million. However, we still believe that the optimal solution to address these humanitarian conditions requires the restoration of peace and stability in Yemen, in a manner that would preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the regional level, and within the framework of the efforts and endeavors undertaken by Kuwait to consolidate the foundations of good neighborly relations, we renew our call to the Islamic Republic of Iran to undertake serious confidence-building measures, and establish relations based on reciprocal cooperation and respect, common interests, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, and renounce practices that jeopardize the security and stability of the region, and contradict with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, as well as to adhere to the resolutions of international legitimacy, thus directing efforts and possibilities towards construction and development, so that all the peoples of the region can enjoy security, peace and well-being.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda faces significant challenges because of the erroneous behavioral patterns of humans over the ages, the impact of natural disasters and the greenhouse effect, that doubles our international responsibility, so that it has become incumbent upon us to do our utmost to fully implement the Agenda, requiring that we all enhance the mechanisms of developmental partnerships, in order to keep pace with the needs and requirements, of sustainable development, thus our fulfillment of our international commitments and solidarity at the global level, will constitute a real start to reach the goals of sustainable development, with the aim of eliminating all forms of poverty. In the context of the historic Paris Agreement, the impact of climate change represents one of the biggest impediments to achieving sustainable development, according to the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility.
The State of Kuwait is steadily forging ahead under the leadership of His Highness, Sheikh Sabah AI Ahmad AI Jaber AI Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait, towards implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda by mainstreaming its goals in Kuwaiti national development plans and programs, with the involvement of all sectors of civil society and partners, which my country has embodied in its development plan for the future under the theme of ""New Kuwait"" 2035, through seven basic pillars that aim to transform Kuwait into a leading financial, commercial, cultural and institutional hub.
7

The State of Kuwait has consistently shouldered its regional & international responsibilities, to achieve development in its various economic, social, and environmental dimensions. We have come a long way on the path of implementing the lofty initiatives of His Highness, the Amir, for the advancement of international partnerships, and reinforcing the history of Kuwait's previous endeavors in the humanitarian and developmental field. The State of Kuwait has not spared any efforts in its endeavors to provide developmental assistance to developing and least developed countries, totaling, to date, 106 countries, through its various institutions, most prominent among which is the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, by offering grants and soft loans to fund infrastructure projects in developing countries, worth more than double the percentage agreed upon internationally.
Mr. President,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before I conclude my statement, allow me to express to you all the gratitude and thanks from the Government and people of the State of Kuwait for the trust you have placed in my country by electing it a non-permanent member in the Security Council for the period 2018-2019 last June.
After almost forty years of Kuwait's first non-permanent membership in the Security Council during the period 1978-1979, we return today to renew our commitment to strengthening the role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security, and the prevention of conflicts, as well as supporting mediation efforts and endeavors for the peaceful settlement of conflicts. We are also committed to support efforts to make it more transparent, and promote the participation of small states in the work of the United Nations and its bodies.
We will strive to support and activate the international response to refugees and immigrant crises, and all other humanitarian crises arising from the worsening wars and conflicts in recent years, while hoping that peace and security prevail all over the world.
Thank you Mr. President."
Latvia,"Mr. President, Excellencies!
[At the outset, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. Lajddk, on assuming the post of President of the current session of the General Assembly. I am sure you will make our region proud.]
The United Nations is, and will be, the central forum for multilateralism and a rules-based global order. This is the place where all nations come together to carry our shared responsibility to deliver peace and security, advance human rights and sustainable development, and cooperate for a better future.
As the only truly global organization, the United Nations must be able to effectively respond to the serious global issues which we face: regional conflicts and humanitarian crises, the threat of terrorism, and insecurities related to migration, climate change, and poverty. Individuals and their need for peace and a decent life are at the center of all these challenges. We must be able to deliver on these needs - as individual nations and as the United Nations.

It is no secret that the organization has grown too complex and bureaucratic to be able to respond to today's challenges in a swift manner. Some even question its credibility and relevance. Latvia also wishes to see the United Nations more effective, more transparent, and more flexible, so it can bring positive, real influence to people on the ground.
While the most recent global agreements have shown that effective multilateralism is possible, we must bring the values and goals of the UN closer to the people. The UN must preserve, and in some instances, regain, the trust of citizens and member states in its ability to prevent and respond to crises, and to promote a rulesbased global order.
The new UN Secretary-General Ant6nio Guterres was elected on a platform of change. Latvia welcomes his appointment and fully supports his vision of more effective United Nations. The Secretary-General's actions and ideas related to qualitative change and reforms in the UN are very encouraging signs. Reforms are never an easy task, but with patience, clear goals, and the cooperation of the UN system and member states, it is possible. The Secretary-General has our full support for his endeavors.

Mr. President,
All people on this planet need peace. For people to fully realize their potential, a stable and secure environment is essential. In too many places conflicts seem to have no end. The very basic principles of international law are violated, borders are changed by force, and human lives suffer. Far too often the United Nations has been unable to prevent conflicts, stop atrocities, or build peace. Too often resources are spent on managing and responding to crises, instead of preventing them.
The UN Security Council bears a particular responsibility for ensuring peace. Its members, especially the veto-wielding members, should move beyond their domestic interests in the name of genuinely addressing global challenges. People see the failures of the UN Security Council as the failures of the UN. We cannot expect trust in the UN if its Security Council does not deliver. Latvia also reiterates its call for the Security Council's reform which is long overdue.

]'
From his first day on the job the UN Secretary-General has made a strong appeal for peace and the prevention of conflicts. We fully support him in this endeavor. Conflict prevention must be at the core of UN action to keep situations of concern from spiraling out of control. Saving human lives and upholding human dignity must be our common priority.
Tools for prevention have long been available, including in the United Nations Charter. But we need to move from a mere commitment to preserve a rules-based global order, to actions to restore it where it has been broken. Latvia will continue to promote democracy, good governance, human rights, and the rule of law as key factors for global stability. Today security is truly a global issue. In particular, Latvia is deeply worried about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons.
North Korea's actions have increased global insecurity. Latvia strongly condemns all nuclear tests and launches of ballistic missiles conducted by North Korea, and its continuous provocative rhetoric. We call on North Korea to return to a credible and meaningful dialogue with the international community and to refrain from any further action that would increase regional tensions.

It is a priority to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution to this situation. In the meantime, all States must fully implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions.
The use of chemical weapons in Syria, which blatantly disregards Syria's obligations as a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, is a deplorable crime which must be fully investigated, and the perpetrators must be held accountable. Latvia has constantly called for accountability regarding these attacks, an accountability which is closely linked to the credibility of the whole international system. For this reason, Latvia has supported the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to assist the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes committed in Syria. We will continue to support the Syrian people and the UN-led political process towards a political resolution of this bloody conflict which has lasted far too long.
Global terrorism is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. The unwavering efforts of the Global Coalition to defeat Daesh have degraded the capabilities of Daesh across all fronts. Latvia welcomes important victories, such as the liberation of Mosul in Iraq. However, our fight is far from over, and we have

to think about new strategies and secure new domains as the threat of terrorism becomes more asymmetric and globally dispersed. Besides military efforts, we must continue to disrupt the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, dismantle financing networks, and counter online and offline propaganda that sets youth on a path towards radicalization.
We are pleased to see that the Riga Protocol on Foreign Terrorist Fighters to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism entered into force this July. We encourage more states to accede to this instrument for addressing the threat that affects countries of origin and of destination. International support will be required to help stabilize liberated areas in Syria and Iraq to allow refugees and internally displaced persons to return and start rebuilding their lives. Latvia provides training to Iraqi security forces and financial support for stabilization efforts.
Mr. President,
Solving existing conflicts is essential for preventing new ones. We must stand firm on the rules based security order in Europe. The

territorial integrity of independent states must be respected by all, including by the Russian Federation. Russia's unprovoked aggression against its neighbors is a serious breach of international security rules. There must be accountability for violations of international law for any aggressor who initiates and sustains these conflicts. For Latvia, the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and respecting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is a priority. Russia's continued aggression in Eastern Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol cannot become
""business as usual"".
We support diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in the Normandy format and in the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group, so as to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements by all parties involved. International monitors must be granted access to Crimea, and human rights violations against residents of Crimea, including Crimean Tatars, must stop.
The United Nations, along with the relevant regional actors, should remain involved in, and committed to, facilitating the resolution of the protracted conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Mr. President,
Last year I stressed that strengthening of the development and security nexus must become our mission. Our priority must be achieving peace and a decent life for everyone, including for the
most vulnerable among us. We must tackle the root causes preventing us from attaining
sustainable development. If conflicts, hardships, and poverty continue, migration and the flow of refugees will further increase. The far-reaching impact of climate change on global security cannot simply be disregarded. We must carry on with our joint commitment to tackle climate change, so that coming generations can live on this planet in a sustainable way. Latvia is fully committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
Now is the time for putting in place the mechanisms of implementation of the 2030 Agenda. This needs to be done at all levels - national, regional, and global, in true partnership with all stakeholders. We welcome the current review of the United Nations development system in order to meet the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda. Next year Latvia will present a Voluntary National Review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to the UN High Level Political

Forum on Sustainable Development. Our national focus is on putting people first, as it will lead to long lasting development gains.
Latvia is ready to share its experience with implementing the 2030 Agenda through development cooperation.
In strengthening the capacities of our partner countries, we prioritize good governance and public sector reforms, combatting corruption, and fostering inclusive economic growth, including by empowering women.
Mr. President,
To enjoy peace and development our societies need space and institutions for free, open, and enlightened public debate where truth can be sought, knowledge shared, and lies exposed. This belief is also at the heart of our approach to countering purposeful and malicious propaganda and disinformation emanating from both state and non-state actors. Our answer to this challenge is to reassert the fundamental principles of freedom of speech, the press, and the independence of media.

Both nationally and internationally, we are committed to supporting the development of independent, professional, transparent, and objective media and journalism; to increasing the resilience of our societies by investing in strengthening critical thinking skills, as well as media and information literacy.
In conclusion, let me reiterate that Latvia remains a strong advocate of the multilateral system and believes in an effective and efficient United Nations, guided by the values on which it was founded. It is time for the UN to adapt to a changing global environment, focus on priorities, and deliver results. The UN Secretary-General cannot do this alone. We all must work together to ensure that our organization functions better and is fit for its
purpose.
Thank you."
Lesotho,"President of the 72""^ Session of the General Assembly,
Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government, Your Excellency, Mr Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations, Distinguished Ladles and Gentlemen,
Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, for your election to the
Presidency of the 72""^ Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your illustrious
career as a diplomat assures us of a successful session. I assure you of my delegation's full support and cooperation during your tenure of office. Let me also hasten to commend your predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his distinct leadership of the 71st Session of the General Assembly. He handled the great responsibility of leading this august body with commendable skill and devotion.
During the last session we also witnessed the election of the new Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, whose impeccable credentials and distinct service within the UN, coupled with the wealth of knowledge and experience that he possesses, leave us hopeful that he will handle the challenges of his new position with commendable dexterity. We, therefore, congratulate you, Mr. Secretary General, on your welldeserved appointment and wish you success in the long journey ahead. In the same breath, we pay tribute to the former Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki - Moon, for a job well done. He performed the duties of his high office with consummate diplomatic skill
and honour.
Mr. President.
We meet once again for the 72""^ time in the history of the United Nations In order to
make an appraisal of the world political, security and economic situation. We do so at a critical juncture in human history, indeed this is the time for a true reflection on the role
1

of our Organization in the 21^ Century - the United Nations upon which humanity
places much faith and hope for a better life for aii.
The paii of despair that had descended upon the world following the Second World War was eased with the adoption of the lofty ideals by our forebears when they came together in San Francisco and resolved to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war; to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small; and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"".
Sadly, today we speak of a world that is slowly regressing to the one that existed seven decades ago. The muitifaceted and complex challenges that have besieged us are threatening to erode the laudable strides that the UN has made since its formation. Inter and intra-State conflict characterizes the modern day world. From the global refugee crisis to the spread of terrorism, the ability of the UN to effectively resolve conflict is put to the test. The heightened tensions in the Korean Peninsula, coupled with the flagrant violation of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions as well the Treaty on the Non-Proiiferation of Nuclear Weapons, speak to the brewing arms race in that part of the world.
As if this is not enough, respect for Human Rights and the rule of law, the very principles that speak to the very fiber of the United Nations, continue to be flouted with impunity. Women and children, in particular, face the worst brutal forms of abuses in this world, especially in conflict ridden countries. Poverty also continues to be a dreadful affliction on the developing countries. It undermines the developing countries' efforts to re-orient their economies towards significant gains in real growth. The result of this scenario is that most poverty stricken populations are left with no option but to sometimes employ unorthodox economic survival methods to sustain their livelihoods.

Mr. President,
It is in the above context that we welcome the theme for this Session: ^'Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet"". The theme resonates squarely with the very principles underpinning the formation of the United Nations. That is what this organization stands for. The complexities and dichotomies that characterize humanity's existence on this planet and the inequalities that prevail between the developed and under-developed countries would be a thing of the past if we were to remain true to our mission and focus on people in our development path.
Whereas the SDGs embrace the concept of universal prosperity for all societies, we are all aware that, in essence, this ideal is still far from being realized. We need to cooperatively move forward in the endeavor to achieve peace and a decent life for all. It is, indeed incumbent upon the entire international community to act in unison, as we strive to restore peace and deploy a universal response to our said ideal. To that end, the immediate challenge is to come up with a new strategy which will encapsulate the SDGs and integrate them, multi-dimensionally, into the concept as outlined in the
theme.
Mr. President,
We are cognisant of the fact that our destiny, in Lesotho, is in our hands; and that the chief responsibility for sustainable and equal development recites with us. As a newly inaugurated Administration, we have set for ourselves very lofty goals to restructure all the important institutions of Government. In this regard, we intend to embark on an ambitious, yet achievable reforms programme. We are committed to full implementation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) decisions, and indeed to taking Lesotho in the path of inclusive reform process comprising Constitutional, Parliamentary, Electoral, Public Sector, and Security Sector Reforms. This is an exercise that will involve all stakeholders who must engage in a genuine and total

commitment to establish a stable political order, which is conducive to economic development.
Our resolve and commitment to implement SADC decisions as the new Government of Lesotho signifies our commitment to work together with our regional Body in pursuit of lasting peace and security in our country and indeed in the whole SADC Region. We have made good progress in the implementation of SADC decisions following the recommendations of Judge Phumaphi Commission of inquiry in Lesotho after the brutal assassination of the then Army Commander, Lt. Gen Mahao in June 2015. I stand before this house today with sadness and great humiliation to report once again the assassination of the Lesotho Army Commander, Lt. Gen Khoantle Mo'tso-Mot'so less
than three weeks ago on the 5^ of September 2017 by two senior army officers, who
were in turn shot and killed by the General's bodyguards. Despite these daunting challenges of political and security instability that seem to be rocking our small Mountain Kingdom, SADC as a regional bloc is standing firm behind us to restore peace, political stability, security and rule of law in Lesotho.
On this note, Mr. President, I wish to thank SADC, our development partners and friends of Lesotho, the African Union and the United Nations for their unwavering support in ensuring that Lesotho's democracy is protected, in pursuit of its economic growth and stability of her Nation.
On the development front, I am happy to report that the Government of Lesotho is committed to maintaining strict fiscal discipline in order to stabilize the national economy, stimulate growth and business activity, while preserving the environment. At the same time, we are relentlessly committed to combatting crime and corruption at all levels of our society, in accordance with Goal 16 of the SDGs, which recognizes that corruption undermines efforts to combat poverty and gender equality. It further acts as a tax to the poor when it comes to accessing their right to public services. We are

aware that on our own, without the support of our cooperating partners, our efforts to root out corruption cannot yield the desired results hence our glaring call to them to join forces with us in this crusade.
Mr. President,
We believe, as a Least Developed Country (LDC), that the concept of development is only meaningful when it bestows tangible benefits to communities in a sustainable manner. It is an indisputable fact that the youth are a thread that holds together the fabric of every nation and can, at the same time, be eminent agents of change. It would be unwise and a serious miscalculation not to recognize the youth as partners of today and leaders of tomorrow. In this regard, we emphasize the importance of the youth's participation in decision making at ail levels. Further, job creation for the youth remains a priority. In reference to goal 8 of the SDGs, global strategy for youth employment is to be operationaiized by the year 2020. Therefore, countries have to develop strategies for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In light of this, the Government of Lesotho remains committed in its resolve to harness the energy of the young Basotho men and women for the advancement of the economy of our country.
Moreover, Lesotho continues to deal with the scourge of the HIV/AIDS pandemic which is more prevalent among women, who are the backbone of our economy. Empowerment of women is a focal point of our development policy; and we believe that the elevation of women to positions of leadership, both in the private and public sectors, will lead to a more equitable and prosperous society in Lesotho. We recognize that poverty and the AIDS pandemic go hand in hand; and therefore our poverty eradication policies are targeted at the most vulnerable groups, being the elderly, AIDS orphans, women and youth. We remain steadfast in ensuring that these are tackled for they are key components of the SDGs.

On the economic front, Lesotho like other Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDG's), continues to face challenges Inherently linked to Its unique geographical position. The burden of high transport costs, cumbersome and slow export processing procedures continue to Impose serious Impediments to our external trade. Suffice It to mention the need for Increased International assistance In Infrastructure development. Institutional capacity building as well as Industrialization and enhancement of productive capacity, not only for the Least Developed Countries but for all Developing Countries.
Mr President, Distinguished Delegates,
Lesotho continues to be a proponent of maintenance of International peace and security. We are deeply disturbed by the ongoing violence In Syria, some African and other parts of the Middle East. The rise of ISIS has added another dimension to the scourge of International terrorism. It has become a force of destruction and renders mayhem on a global scale. We are encouraged by recent efforts aimed at shrinking the boundaries of the territories controlled by ISIS In Iraq and Syria. As a result of the on going violence In the Middle East and elsewhere, the world refugee population has risen to more than sixty five million displaced persons. Including those fleeing from hunger. This situation Is Intolerable as It has created an environment In which young people have become vulnerable to recruitment by terrorist movements and human trafficking.
Mr. President,
In recent years Lesotho has been facing prolonged droughts due to the El Nino effect, which grippled the entire Southern African sub-continent leading to food shortages and other hardships. The recent hurricanes that devastated the Caribbean and other parts of the United States and torrential rains witnessed In many countries. Including floods of Biblical proportions, are a stark reminder that climate change Is here with us and that an urgent action Is required In accordance with the Paris Climate Change Treaty concluded more than a year ago.

We reiterate our appeal that small countries like Lesotho, including Small Island States, be empowered with technologies to deal with and adapt to climate change challenges. Attainment of sustainable development will elude us if there is no genuine commitment by all including our Development Partners. Indeed, the principles of common but differentiated responsibility and economic might and capability between the developed and the developing nations, are critical for our success in building a sustainable world. We, therefore, call on the international community to continue mobilizing and providing additional financial resources to Africa for climate friendly technologies to address, both the urgent adaptation and mitigation needs of Africa, and other developing countries. In the same vein, we urge countries that have reneged on their support to the Paris Agreement to reconsider their position and come back to the fold.
Mr. President,
One of the most notable achievements, accomplished by the International community, through the United Nations, is the eradication of colonialism. However, this business remains unfinished. The questions of Western Sahara and Palestine have defied solution for a long time. We reiterate our support for Western Sahara in its struggle for self-
determination.
Each day that passes without a change in the lives of the People of Western Sahara is a reminder to the world that we must renew our determination to fight the injustices perpetrated against the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic. History will judge us harshly if we silently watched the unjust treatment meted out on the People of that African country. Our silence and inaction would leave an indelible mark of failure on our
character as a collective.
The modern day world has no place for practice of colonial tactics. In this connection,
we call on the United Nations to remain resolute on its determination to rid the world of
the scourge of colonialism. The agreement by the Polisaho Front and Morocco to resume negotiations in order to reach a long term solution has not gone unnoticed. We

commend them for that bold step and assure them of our support in their noble
endeavours.
The Question of Palestine has been on the UN agenda for decades. We continue to believe that the two states solution, on the basis of the 1967 borders, whereby Israel and Palestine will co-exist, side by side in equal sovereignty, is the most viable proposition for a permanent resolution to this vexing problem. The Palestinians too deserve to enjoy the Right to Peace, Development and Sanctity of Life.
Mr. President,
On the Nuclear Disarmament landscape, the UN made significant progress a few months ago with the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons, with the goal of leading towards their total elimination. This is a historic achievement of our time, especially in light of the on-going tensions in the Korean Peninsula. The argument that Nuclear Weapons are a deterrent is a fallacy, these weapons are a threat to human existence and their possessors should do the right thing and renounce them in line with their international obligations. This Treaty should not remain on paper only, but it must be ratified and implemented by all.
As I conclude my statement, Mr. President, allow me to point out that we should continue to resist all attempts to undermine the global consensus that the UN has built around many issues of importance to our Peoples. We remain convinced that the United Nations is the only universal institution that can safeguard world peace and ensure the survival of all and sundry. But, for it to do so, the reform agenda of the UN must proceed without further delay, including the reform of the Security Council. A Council that is transparent, representative of all regions, including Africa, will go a long way towards fulfilling the ideals for which the UN was formed. Unilateral actions that defy civility and international law belong to the past. Let us march fon/vard with unity of

purpose while focusing on our People and striving for peace so that we can all have a
decent life.
1 THANK YOU!"
Liberia,"Mr. President Mr. Secretary General Excellencies, Heads of State and Government Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen
This 72d Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly is being convened at a time of historic transition in Liberia, and during a period of acute challenges to our global order. Today, we face the threat of climate change, the violence of terrorism, the risk and indignation of migration, and a nuclear escalation on the Korean peninsula. More over there is a race against time to accommodate a restless youthful population in search of opportunity and a brighter
future.
Mr. Secretary General I congratulate you on your election.
Your progressive and creative leadership assures us of our commitment and your action to reform the United Nations for increased efficiency, better coordination and gender parity by 2021 at the senior leadership level. My delegation is also pleased with the initial steps taken toward the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
I congratulate you, Mr. MiroslavLajcak, on your election as President of the General Assembly. Your vast experience and strong diplomatic skills assure us that you will steer the affairs of this 72nd Regular Session in an effective manner. The Liberian delegation offers you its full cooperation and support.
I would also like to recognize Mr. Peter Thompson of Fiji for his stewardship over the past year, which saw the launch of the Sustainable Development Agenda and the successful conduct of the
first ocean conference.


Our theme this year, Focusing on People - Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for all on a Sustainable Planet is one which aptly captures a universal aspiration. I hope that at the conclusion of our deliberations, we will forge a consensus and renew our commitment as leaders to transform the lives of our people and meet our responsibility to our planet. The work of the United Nations has never been more important to the search for peace and the sustenance for global stability than it is today.
By its charter and purposes, the United Nations still represents the genius of our collective ability to live together in peace and harmony. It still offers great hope to a troubled world. Liberians bear witness to this truth, and remain grateful to the United Nations, and all of its organs and agencies, for the critical security interventions, and continued support toward Liberia's recovery and democratic aspirations.
Mr. President, eleven years ago, in September of 2006, I stood before this august body as the newly elected president of the Republic of Liberia, and, the first woman to be democratically elected as head of State on the African continent.
Today, I address you for the last time as I bring to closure my two terms of elected office. Liberia is just 22 days away from historic legislative and presidential elections. It will mark the first time in 73 years that political power will be handed over peacefully, and democratically, from one elected leader to another. This paves the way for the next generation of Liberians to lead the country into the
future.
The election will signal the irreversible course that Liberia has embarked upon to consolidate its young, post-conflict democracy. Indeed, democracy is on the march in Liberia and, I believe, on an irreversible path forward on the African continent.


I thank all our partners who made meaningful contributions, financial and in-kind to ensure peaceful elections, and those organizations which will deploy observer missions to attest to the integrity of the elections process.
Mr. President,
I assumed office after 25 years of development reversal which was further compounded by a 15-year civil war. We have made great progress and laid the foundation for the next democratic
government.
We have reshaped the Armed Forces of Liberia and the Liberia National Police, professionalized our customs and immigration services and small Liberian Coast Guard. We are proud to report that since the formal turnover of the security responsibilities to the Government, Liberia has remained stable, peaceful and secured.
We transformed the economy from a growth rate of less than zero to more than 8.7% in 2013, until the health crisis and plummeting commodity prices brought a downturn to our economic recovery. Liberia has adjusted, we are resilient, embracing diversification. Our focus today is towards strengthening the agriculture sector for value addition, and infrastructure development with emphasis on roads and energy for industrialization.
Previously dysfunctional public institutions now have the capacity to respond to the needs of our citizens through decentralized county service centers with ownership by strong local governments. And from the tragedy of the health crisis, we are strengthening our healthcare systems, prioritizing prevention and delivering capacity at the community level.


Impact is being felt. Life expectancy progressed from a low 47 years to a hopeful 62 years with reduction in maternal death from 1400 to 1100, an annual rate of reduction of 3.4%. Poverty rate has decreased from 63.8% in 2007 to 50.9% in 2016.
Infrastructure has been repaired and restored, and we continue to rehabilitate damaged roads and construct new ones. With the increasing provisions of electricity, potable water and technology, cities and towns are bustling with new life. It is now possible to receive voice and data on your phones and mobile devices from virtually everywhere in the country, at competitively low rates.
Liberia has enjoyed the benefit of multilateralism through full support provided by the United Nations, the African Linion, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). From a pariah state, Liberia has gradually regained the confidence of nations and even risen to assume leadership roles in regional bodies, specifically ECOWAS and the Mano River Union.
I was personally privileged to play a role in the formulation of the Sustainable Development Agenda as Co-chair of Secretary-General BAN Ki-Moon's High-Level Panel on SDGs and in framing the Common Africa Position (CAP) as Chair of the ALI's High-Level Committee.
Mr. President,
There is so much more to share about Liberia's post conflict transformation, how we have empowered ordinary citizens and a shared sense of citizenship, giving women, including market and rural women a voice and the rights to be heard. We have continued to transform the healthcare and education systems, engendered the


entrepreneurial spirit in our youth, our vibrant media and civil society. We are establishing trans-border development corridors to enhance regional trade and strengthening the rule of law to tackle systematic corruption. Liberia is experiencing the birth of a postconflict artistic community, in song, hip-hop, painting, poetry, storytelling and fashion.
Liberia has come a long way. We could not have accomplished all of this without the world body, its political leadership, the generosity of its economic development support, humanitarian contributions, and, most importantly, the stabilization and security provided to our country through the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).
I take this opportunity to applaud you, Mr. President, your predecessors, the member nations, and UN civil servants around the world who have sacrificed for us to see the very first generation of school-aged children growing up in an environment of peace, free of the violence of civil conflict.
Liberia's transformation was powered by a world community that made a shared commitment to deliver peace to a country, and a subregion, beset by civil conflict and cross border destabilization. The UN and its partner nations were of one mind, and from that global unity, a new Liberian democratic state was born. Liberia is a post conflict success story. It is your post conflict success story.
Mr. President,
As I bid farewell to you today, and to my fellow Heads of State, I have a few parting thoughts. First, remember Liberia which is making valiant effort to apply the tenets of democracy. Consider the lives saved, the wealth created, the stability assured, because this


global body convened and led at a time of great uncertainty in our sub-region and around the world. I ask you and the member states to continue to lead, to spread the values of democracy, human rights, and good governance while strengthening solidarity for economic transformation and social resilience. It is often in times of transition that great leaders emerge and institutions are strengthened.
Secondly, I remind you that two years ago, the 70th Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Agenda containing 17 goals, which encapsulate the aspirations of member states to eradicate poverty and reduce, if not eliminate, inequalities within and between countries. Our commitment to achieving these goals must be unwavering because progress here is inextricably linked to ending conflict and sustaining peace.
Thirdly, real progress remains elusive in the lingering effort to reform the Security Council and make it more responsive to current global realities. The call for this reform must be pursued more robustly towards early conclusion. Africa's views are well articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus. Today, African nations are participating in strong sub-regional and regional bodies, which are evolving - adopting measures to secure and preserve peace and security, while strengthening economic integration.
The United Nations, as the preeminent world body must also continue to evolve, to more effectively serve the common interest of all Member States. You must continue to chart the way forward. In your capable hands rest the hope and aspirations for a more just, peaceful and humane world, for the sake of our people and our planet.
I thank you for your attention."
Liechtenstein,"Mr. President, Excellencies, Dear colleagues,
It is good to see you preside over this session of the Assembly, Mr. President. We know that we are in able hands. I look forward to working closely with you. We also salute Secretary-General Guterres for his leadership. I am confident that he will chart an intelligent course to the changes that we wish to see in the United Nations.
Mr. President You have suggested to us the theme ""focus on people"". This takes us back to the very beginning of the UN Charter, written on behalf of the peoples of the world. To this day, the United Nations symbolizes great hope around theglobe: Hope for peace, hope for justice, hope for a life in dignity and decency. It represents nothing but the most basic ambition of every human being. And yet, attaining these hopes remains elusive for millions. And they are shattered for millions of others.
Intolerance and nationalism were drivers of World War II in response to which this organization was founded. It is a place where we seek solutions, together - instead of pursuing nationalist agendas. Only in embracing this understanding will we be able to get the best results at the United Nations. The horrors of armed conflict, the tragedy of World War II in particular, led the founding nations topledge to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We have undertaken a collective obligation to remove threats to the peace and to suppress acts of aggression. But today we often manage and contain armed conflict rather than preventing it in the first place. We must do better. This year we have the opportunity to make a historic step forward. For the first time since the creation of the United Nations, we can give an international tribunal jurisdiction over the crime of aggression: The most serious forms of the illegal use of force will be punishable. The tribunal in charge will be the International Criminal Court, the centerpiece of our common fight for accountability. I appeal to all of you today: Live up to the commitment we have made when signing on to the UN Charter. Let us enforce the prohibition

of the illegal use of force by making it punishable in the highest court of criminal law that we
have.
Next year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ICC. With jurisdiction over the most serious offences against international law, it represents an enormous achievement. But it still lacks universality. A significant impunity gap therefore remains. There is still a very large number of people who do not benefit from its legal protection. They must not be left without hope. They also deserve a real prospect for justice. The people of Syria in particular have suffered unspeakable violence. The crimes committed against them are atrocious. And the silence which has been our only response for a long time puts us all to shame. But finally, late last year, we came together to create a real prospect for justice: The accountability mechanism (IIIM) which this Assembly established. The mechanism itself will not conduct criminal proceedings against the perpetrators. But it can be critically important. Preparing case files for prosecutions in courts with jurisdiction is a decisive step forward. A key to its success is strong support from us States: Politically, by insisting on the importance of justice as part of political solutions. Financially, by providing sustainable funding. Substantively, by sharing information and evidence of crimes that is in our possession.
Accountability for the worst crimes imaginable, committed in Syria but also elsewhere, is essential. But the truth is also: There is no remedy and no compensation for these crimes. Prevention is the only effective form of protection. We are looking for leadership by the Security Council in particular. I thank the 113 states who have joined us in supporting the Code of Conduct for the Security Council for mass atrocity crimes. Together, we represent a strong majority of States who look for effective action by the Council to end and prevent such crimes. This pledge could not come at a better moment: Secretary General Guterres has made prevention a key priority of his agenda. And applying the Code of Conduct works best in a productive interplay between him and the Security Council.

Mr. President Never before have the needs for humanitarian assistance been as big as they are today. And never before have we seen such a significant shortfall in our response. The so-called ""forgotten crises"", are those which may need our attention the most. Yet, our collective attention span barely does justice to the most visible emergencies. Armed conflict remains a key driver of displacement, of human suffering, of instability. But there are numerous other factors that make people leave their homes. Globally, unprecedented numbers of people are on the move. History has seen various periods of mass migration. There is ample evidence that migration has been a positive and enriching factor for receiving societies. But mass movements of people and irregular migration in particular also tend to create anxiety and fear. Taking these reactions seriously is crucial to overcome them. My son entered kindergarten last year. Two children in his group are refugees from Syria. As a mother, I reflected on how this might influence him and his development. What happened was that he quickly learned a few words in Arabic and what a Syrian birthday cake tastes like. He also understands now that there are kids who spend every night thinking that their house might be bombed.
We place high hopes in the Global Compact on Migration that we will adopt together next year. I echo the call of Secretary-General Guterres: Migration must be an option, not a necessity. Irregular migrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Human trafficking and modern slavery are perhaps the biggest human rights scandal of our time. They are a global phenomenon. But they thrive especially in circumstances that create high levels of vulnerability. As is the case so often, women and girls are disproportionately affected. We have agreed, many decades ago, on the abolition of slavery in all its forms. The relevant legal norm has universal application. And yet, reality is: There is a disturbing level of impunity for them. We must no longer accept this paradox. Humantrafficking and modern slavery are not only crimes. They are also a profitable form of organized crime, we see big potential in applying the tools developed to combat other forms of organized crime. Following the money can lead us to the perpetrators. Liechtenstein is prepared to make the expertise available that we have generated as a financial center committed to international standards of transparency and accountability.

Mr. President, The people we serve look at us to reduce risks, to defuse tensions. Yet the world spirals towards a new arms race. We are facing increased risks of self-destruction. This includes the unspeakable horror of the use of nuclear weapons. Most of us remember the shocking pictures from Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 from our history books. The United Nations was built on the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and on the promise of ""never again"". But we have not delivered on this promise - in collective complacency. This week we have changed course for the better, with the signing of the treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons. No doubt, it will take time to see the effects of the treaty on nuclear stockpiles. But setting a number of important legal benchmarks that will become binding norms is great progress. Nuclear weapons are prohibited and should be eliminated. Their use can never be justified. The suffering they cause runs counter to the principles of humanity, basic tenets of international humanitarian law and the dictates of public conscience. On Wednesday, I signed the treaty on behalf of Liechtenstein, as one of 50 States. Together we extend a hand to those who so far have chosen to stay apart. We need their commitment to finally rid the world of nuclear weapons.
Mr. President, I have had the privilege to speak before this Assembly eight times already. Every single time I have talked about one aspect of the UN work that is particularly dear to me: Full gender equality. The progress of the past decades has slowed down significantly, both internationally and back home. This is a disturbing trend. Commitments have gone unfulfilled, and strategies have turned out to be little more than empty promises. Achievements that nobody questioned twenty years ago are under attack. Levels of political participation decrease. The numbers on gender pay gaps are still shocking. And yet, I remain not only committed, but also optimistic: Simply because I strongly believe that many of our common goals will only become achievable if we indeed achieve gender equality. In the Sustainable Development Goals, the domestic and the international come together, if there is one area where the UN must show the way, this is certainly it.

The work of the United Nations can seem abstract. Explaining its relevance to our citizens at home, to our children can be a challenge. There are other topics that make that task much easier, for example climate change. Everybody understands the parameters of the discussion: If we have no livable planet, nobody will prosper, irrespective of nationality, gender, economic wealth. And none of us, large or small, can tackle the problem on our own. The Paris Agreement does not end the threat of climate change. But it is our only realistic hope to address it, together. Depositing our instrument of ratification earlier this week therefore gave me great satisfaction. And it is something that I will be proud to share with my children.
I thank you."
Lithuania,"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The topic of this year' s debate invites to focus on people and our responsibility to ensure their peaceful and sustainable future.
However, in today's world such peaceful future is threatened as never before.
Authoritarian regimes continue to kill with impunity, extremist ideologies treat innocent people with unspeakable cruelty and thousands die after leaving their homes in search for better lives.
The world's attention is now focused on North Korea and Syria, but the same methods of blaclnail, bullying and aggression are being used by Russia in Ukraine and along NATO's eastern border.
As we speak, around one hundred thousand Russian troops are engaged in offensive military exercises ""Zapad 2017"" on the borders of Baltic States, Poland and even in the Arctic. The Kremlin is rehearsing aggressive scenarios against its neighbours, training its army to attack the West. The exercise is also part of information warfare aimed at spreading uncertainty and
fear.
Even more disturbingly, Zapad exercise is just one symptom of Kremlin's inability to finally end its hatred towards the West.
Despite Russia's special responsibility to protect international peace as permanent member of the Security Council, it violated the UN Charter by attacking Georgia, illegally annexing Crimea, and directly participating in the war in Eastern Ukraine.
Kremlin's arsenal does not stop at conventional weapons. Russia continues to meddle in elections, conducts cyber-attacks and uses its ""sputniks"" to spread fake news and destabilising propaganda.
Energy blackmail has long become Russia's weapon of choice. In Belarus, just forty kilometres from Lithuania's capital, it is building the unsafe Astravets nuclear power plant as a geopolitical weapon that fails to comply with basic international nuclear standards.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Abuses and indifference to basic international norms by regimes across the world are not unrelated cases. Too often they are a result of our collective failure to condemn and properly react to violations.
Time and time again we have no courage to enforce the rules that we ourselves create. We draw red lines in the sand and then pretend they don't exist.
This has to change. Bullies are aggressive precisely because they are weak and insecure. That is why we must stop being passive observers and start calling things by their own names.
Aggression cannot make anyone stronger. It can never earn anyone even a drop of respect. The only thing the aggression will bring is contempt, shame and condemnation.
The international community has to take its share of responsibility. We cannot let fear win by closing our eyes to violators, because it will only encourage them to go further.
We must learn to read the warning signs, because abuse of human rights, nationalistic rhetoric and suppression of free speech explode into violence if ignored.
Finally, we must change the UN. This unique universal body was created to save the world from wars. So far it has failed to fulfil this promise.
Now we face the choice: either we give this organisation the voice to rise against the abuse or we will make it irrelevant.
Thank you."
Malawi,"Your Excellency, Mr. Miroslav Lajcak, President of the General Assembly; o Your Excellency, Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations;  Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government;  Distinguished Delegates; o Ladies and Gentlemen
The cause that rallies us together is that we are one humanity, on one planet. This is the tie that binds us all. And all our differences and national interests are secondary to this overriding cause.
The United Nations was founded to safeguard the human race, its human rights, and its potential. We are here to protect people, their existence and their rights. We are here to ensure that the potential of every people, everywhere, fully blossoms into flowers of hope. It is our sacred duty, as a generation, to take actions that offer hope to next generations.
It is therefore befitting, that this year, we meet to think about focusing on people. For Africa, we should be focusing on investing in the people if the full potential of African people is to be realised.
Unfortunately, there are many outside the African continent who choose to focus on its socio-political weaknesses instead of focusing on the huge potential of African people As one analyst has said:
Africa is often seen as a vast continent of incomprehensible tribalism, endemic corruption, and almost intrinsic misery and violence
This is the view history has painted in the mind of the world. And this one-sided perception of Africa must end. This negative view blinds the world from seeing the potential of African people. We can only realise the potential of any people when we see them positively.
Mr President,

The eradication of poverty and the pursuit of prosperity across the world should be based on raising the potential of the people we seek to support. Development cannot be taken to any people and succeed unless it is driven from within. No human community can take off socio-economically without empowering its people to drive their own development agenda. That is why I underline the importance of investing in the human capital.
However, it is also a foregone conclusion that any efforts to invest in the people and raise their potential need our collaboration as a global family. Hence, our appeal for concerted action by all member states of the UN and indeed many other global non-state actors.
Mr. President,
The adoption of Agenda 2030 by the UN reflects our global resolve to address the most pressing challenges in the spirit of sustainable human collaboration. Our unity among nations is imperative because we achieve more when we unite and collaborate.
The well-being of the global society is more assured when we work in partnerships for development. At the same time, we achieve more within our nations with inclusion of all sectors of society.
Statistics provided by the World Bank and the UN show that there is correlation between inclusion and empowerment of women on one hand and economic growth and development on the other.
Mr President,
The inclusion and empowerment of women begin with a focus on the girl child. We need to do away with early marriages. Indeed, I am pleased to note a global drop of marriages from 36% to 26% over a period of two years since 2015.
Malawi is proud to be part of this achievement. Among other initiatives, my Government has passed a law against marriage below the age of 18. By law, Malawi
3

provides an opportunity for girls to grow, mature and make informed choices about their education and future life. Girls are protected by law in this regard.
I am, therefore, proud to reiterate my Government's commitment in promoting gender equality, women and girls' empowerment in order to reduce the vulnerabilities of women and adolescent girls to violence and all forms of abuse.
Mr. President
In focusing on people, one more critical category is the Youth. Youth empowerment is a means to achieving inclusion. According to the 2015 African Economic Outlook, Africa has the fastest growing and most youthful population in the world. In giving the Youth the focus they deserve, the African Union agreed to make 2017 the Year of the Youth. This is the year we focus on investing in the Youth.
Malawi is honoured to be part of the mission for Youth empowerment. We have taken decisive measures that include providing technical and entrepreneurial education to the youth who have not had the opportunity to attend university. At the same time, we are also increasing access to tertiary education.
One more category that needs inclusion is that of persons with disability. Malawi is reviewing its policies and strategies in education, health and trade in order to foster effective inclusion of persons with disabilities.
Further, Malawi has made strides in efforts to eradicate vicious and irrational attacks against persons with Albinism. There was a time when these attacks became rampant in some parts of the country. I am glad to report that there have not been any new attacks in the past six months.
Mr. President,
Malawi is committed to inclusive development. We however recognise that the majority of our citizens continue to depend on agriculture for their livelihood. But agriculture is a challenging sector given the current climate variability affecting many parts of the world. That being the case, Malawi is implementing social protection programmes in order to cushion the vulnerable segments of our population. Our measures include cash
4

transfer programmes, food for work, school feeding programmes and a farm income subsidy programme.
Let me take this opportunity to express our gratitude to cooperating partners, including the various UN bodies for their continued technical and other related support towards the success of these programmes.
Mr. President,
As we think of focusing on people, it is important to pay close attention at the issues that affect most vulnerable citizens. Climate change is one factor on top of the list. For an economy that depends on agriculture in a country like Malawi where 85% of the people are in agrarian communities, crop failure is always a tragedy. For two consecutive years, Malawi has suffered alternating heavy rains, floods and drought that led to crop failure and hunger.
The suffering caused by climate change everywhere is real. The people who suffer in the tragedies are not just in figures and statistics. These are real human souls like anyone here.
We all need to feel the urgent need to collectively undertake sustainable management of our natural resources. We must remember that if this planet perishes, we all perish with it! This is a matter that demands our collective responsibility.
Therefore, let me appeal to all member states to consider strategies and avenues of collaboration for us to adapt to the fast-changing climate.
Apart from climate change, our world is also collectively facing the threat of terrorism. Terrorism and conflict hinder progress and make the world live in a state of fear. Anything that causes mankind to live in a state of fear is an evil to be fought. Malawi stands in solidarity with the victims of terrorism across the world. We reaffirm our commitment to stand against all forms of terrorism.
We stand in solidarity with victims of human trafficking and forced migration wherever they are.

Mr. President

Let me now move to the question of peace. Peace is a prerequisite for development. As a country, we believe in peace as a necessary condition for human existence. For this reason, Malawi has been active in peace building operations of the United Nations and African Union.

Today, Malawi reaffirms its pledge to continue as an envoy of peace. We believe this is our duty to humanity. We believe that in protecting your neighbours, you protect yourself.

While we all seek peace as a necessary condition for existence, we face the threat of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are an existential threat to humanity. The threat of nuclear weapons is a concern to us all. Ironically, even those nations who keep nuclear weapons get concerned with this threat. The idea of keeping nuclear weapons questions the wisdom of mankind.

Let me express, categorically, my Government's disapproval of the spread of ballistic missile technology. This should not be tolerated in any way by any member states of the United Nations.

There is no country that is too small to contribute to the peace agenda of the world. There is no continent that is too poor to be part of the global peace agenda.

Malawi strongly supports the African position for the full representation of the continent on the Security Council. The United Nations can no longer claim to lead in democracy while side-lining a representation of 1.2 billion people from Africa. How can we claim to be in unity with those whom we exclude? Africa must be included!

Our rising Africa is always ready to play her role in the global community. And Malawi will continue to be a global player.

Thank you for your attention!

Malaysia,"Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladles and Gentlemen,
I congratulate you on your appointment as the President of the Seventy-Second (72""'') Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
I am confident that under your able stewardship, the General Assembly, as the main deliberative and policy-making organ of the United Nations, will see substantial advancement in addressing the many challenges our Organisation faces today.
I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres on his appointment as the 9""' UN Secretary-General early this year. Your endeavour to make the United Nations an effective, relevant and august Organisation, I assure you, has Malaysia's fullest support
and cooperation.

Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladles and Gentlemen,
Sustainable Development Goals fSDGs)
This year's Seventy-Second (72""'') UNGA theme, 'Focusing on
People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet' is most relevant and timely, as we work collectively and individually to achieve all 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. This journey is 'no mean feat'. Some have even advocated that it should be the only focus for the entire international community to strive towards ensuring our future survival in an inclusive manner. We must strengthen our resolve and fulfill our promise to each and every citizen of the world that
'no one will be left behind'.

On this basis, Malaysia has always oriented its development
agenda to accomplish this very promise.
Sustainable development has been at the heart of Malaysia's development approach since the 1970s. In 2009, the Malaysian
Govemment launched its New Economic Model, which features three new goals; to achieve high income, inclusivity and sustainability. These pursuits continue to resonate well with the three components of the 2030 Agenda, namely economic growth, social needs and environmental protection.
We have also adopted forward-looking development policies through the Eleventh (11""') Malaysia Plan, spanning five years from 2016-2020, with the theme 'Anchoring Growth on People'. This development plan reaffirms the Malaysian Government's commitment to a vision of growth anchored on the prosperity and wellbeing of its people while protecting the environment and
strengthening peace.

In July this year, Malaysia presented its Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the High-Level Political Forum on SDGs. The VNR, which reports the actions and measures taken by Malaysia to advance the implementation of the SDGs, is testimony to Malaysia's continued commitment to achieve the 2030 Agenda. The
Government of Malaysia strives to ensure that each and every Malaysian has an equitable share in the prosperity and wealth of
the country, and that no one will be left behind.
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladles and Gentlemen,
Security
Earlier this week, Malaysia joined other Member States in signing
the Treaty to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons. We are convinced that the political and legal impact of this Treaty will steer the international
community collectively towards the elimination of nuclear weapons and the maintenance of a world free of nuclear weapons. We were

guided by the commitment of states on an instrument which is legally sound, feasible to implement and one that sends a powerful political message that nuclear weapons are categorically
unacceptable.
Malaysia strongly believes in continuing to strengthen and enhance legislative and collective enforcement capabilities in confronting international security threats, in particular the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) specifically to non-State actors. We remain steadfastly committed to our international
obligations in the fields of disarmament and international security through various national, regional and international approaches.
In this regard, Malaysia reiterates its strong condemnation of
DPRK's nuclear tests and missile launches which seriously
undermined the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Malaysia calls on the DPRK to desist from conducting further
nuclear tests and missile launches, to halt its nuclear and ballistic

missiles programme, and to comply fully with its international obligations inthe interest of the maintenance of international peace and security. Malaysia joins other nations in stressing the need for the immediate resumption of peaceful dialogue and negotiations among the relevant parties towards finding a durable solution to
this longstanding conflict.
We are also seeing a convergence of new security threats emerging from irregular migration and transnational crime activities, which include terrorism, trafficking in persons, illicit drug trafficking, money laundering and cyber-crimes.
The threats we face today have an increasingly regional and international impact, affecting our economies and lives in ways which we have never experienced before. And for these reasons, Malaysia has taken significant efforts to improve our legislations and enforcement capabilities by adopting a holistic approach in preventing and combating these heinous crimes.
6

Rohinqyas
Sadly, as we devote our attention to peace, decent life and a sustainable planet, there are people in this world who are suffering
from horrifying crimes against humanity.
Overthe past few weeks, we have seen the recurrence of violence instigated by a delusional and desperate militant group of Rohingyas in Rakhine State. However, the subsequent 'clearance operations' by Myanmar have claimed countless innocent civilian
lives and caused more than 400,000 Rohingyas to flee their homes.
Indiscriminate violence perpetrated against the Rohingyas during these operations is of grave concern for Malaysia and also to
others. Such atrocities have unleashed a full-scale humanitarian
crisis that the world simply cannot ignore but must be compelled to
act.

If the current situation is not addressed judiciously, the desperate
people in Rakhine will become easy prey to recruitment by extremists. Prolonged frustration, anger and deprivation provide fertile breeding ground for it.
Though the Myanmar Government has given its repeated assurances to implement measures to resolve the issue, the recent
incidents of violence has not assuage our concerns for effective safeguards to be put in place on the ground.
Therefore, I call upon the Govemment of Myanmar to end the violence and stop the destructions to life and properties, and allow immediate unimpeded access for the delivery of humanitarian aid.
I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Bangladesh Government for doing their utmost in receiving almost half a million Rohingya refugees in the past three weeks. Sheltering such a huge number of refugees certainly puts a strain on any
8

country. Malaysia has dispatched humanitarian aid to Bangladesh on 9 September 2017 and will do more. In the spirit of compassion and humanity, I call on the international community to support the
humanitarian efforts in Bangladesh.
Palestine
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Our collective failure in finding a solution to the Palestinian question is unacceptable. The situation in Palestine remains daunting and appalling as Israel continues to violate international law with its heavy-handed approach against the defenceless Palestinians.
As Israeli occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory marks the 50""^ year, we must continue to intensify our efforts in finding a just and durable solution to the Palestinian question. Malaysia reiterates that any action by Israel, to impose its laws, jurisdiction

and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem are illegal and
totally unacceptable.
We remain extremely concerned over the lack of accountability by the Israeli occupying forces, as well as the ongoing blockade of
Gaza and the resulting humanitarian crisis.
We are extremely dismayed with the diminishing prospect of
peaceful co-existence as Israel's illegal settlement activities
continue unabated. The implementation of Resolution 2334
adopted by the UN Security Council on 23 December 2016 remains a challenge. In this regard, Malaysia reiterates its support to the
work of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and its pro-active approach to pronounce the need for a written quarterly report of the Secretary-General on
the implementation of the said resolution. We urge the international community, especially Member States, to remain firmly principled in supporting this vital call. If, we continue to allow for the resolution
to be deliberately weakened in an unashamedly manner and
10

rendering it unimpiementable, we would be guilty of deconstructing
the two-state solution.
Malaysia will continue to support the works of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The plight of some five million registered Palestine refugees must not be ignored. In view of its weakening financial situation, we urge the international community to strengthen its commitment in providing financial assistance and other relevant
assistance to UNRWA.
Moderation
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladles and Gentlemen,
11

In our fight against the scourge of violent extremism, Malaysia
would like to reiterate the continued urgency to harness the
approach of moderation to negate the propagation of extremism
and radicalisation.
To this end, Malaysia restates its call for a Global Movement of Moderates, made by the Honourable Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2010, to douse the flame of hatred and stem the influence of extreme and myopic ideas of intolerance, xenophobia and racial
hatred, among others.
It is imperative for communities of different race, religion and culture to band together in seeking common peaceful aspirations and celebrate our diversity rather than be influenced, and enticed
into extremist traps.
12

Malaysia, therefore, looks forward to bringing forth the Global Movement of Moderates initiative to the UN through a Resolution at this Session. It is imperative that the voices of reason, tolerance and understanding drown out the voices which glorify extremism that sow seeds of hatred amongst our communities.
UN Management Reform
Mr. President, Exceiiencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
In order to successfully perform the arduous tasks at hand, the
United Nations cannot afford to stand still and remain idle. Since
taking over the helm of the Organisation, the Secretary-General
together with the UN Secretariat have initiated various efforts to
make the Organisation more efficient, effective, agile and fit-for-
purpose.
13

Malaysia commends the dynamic leadership of the SecretaryGeneral through his various reform initiatives which include the review of the Peace and Security Architecture, enhancing the overall Development System and UN Management Reform, amongst others.
Malaysia is of the view that any major reform initiative that may include cost-cutting measures should not hamper or disrupt the Organisation's existing development efforts to achieve peace and a decent life for all. This includes development programmes in developing countries especially countries in areas of conflict, peacekeeping operations and peacebuilding.
I wish to extend my delegation's full cooperation, support and commitment in working closely with you, Mr. Secretary General, all
UN Member States and various stakeholders towards
implementing the reform initiatives.
14

Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladles and Gentlemen, Let us strengthen our resolve in fulfilling our collective
responsibilities.
Allow me to assure you of Malaysia's continued support and
commitment to the agenda of the United Nations and the work of the General Assembly.
thank you.

Maldives,"Mr President Mr Secretary General Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Assalam-alaikum va-rahmathullahi va-barakaathu and a very Good afternoon to you all
We stand today at the cross roads  between old wars and new conflicts, between what we know, and what we fear - between the needs of a changing planet, and the demands of a growing population. We remain caught between human ambition and human limitations. And in these times of change, we must turn once again to the principles that defined this Organisation. Those that make us who we are, and who we would like to become.
Rising from the darkness of war, the United Nations shone like a beacon of light. Dedicated to seeking peace, this organisation became the purpose for many. For many of those fighting for freedom, fighting fear, and fighting for the right to be. The United Nations was, and is, the best hope we have for humanity.
The United Nations was built on the promise of peace, and salvation  a place where every issue can be debated for a solution, where every nation has a voice regardless of size, regardless of might.
This is why we believe that the theme for this session of the General Assembly is most appropriate. ""Focusing on people, striving for peace and a decent life for all, on a sustainable planet""  this is what makes up the core of this organisation. This is what defines our work.
1

Please allow me to congratulate you Mr President, on your assumption as the 72nd President of the General Assembly. I also welcome the Secretary General Mr Antnio Guterres to his first General Debate, and commend him for the dedication he has demonstrated throughout his first year in office.
Mr President,
The United Nations is what we all make of it. It is made up of us, the Member States. Its successes and its weaknesses are determined by how much we put into it.
My country, the Maldives, envisions a United Nations that is fair, that is representative of its diverse membership, that takes into account the views and opinions of all, and forms consensus, based on compromise and dialogue. A United Nations that commits and delivers.
Our vision for a stronger United Nations is founded on President Abdullah Yameen Abdul Gayoom's policy of strengthening national resilience  economic resilience, social resilience, political resilience, and indeed environmental resilience. Crafting meaningful global solutions built on national policies and experiences, for the common problems of our times, for our common, and shared destiny.
Mr President,
The world must become a safer planet for all. No man, no woman, and certainly no child, must suffer due to conflict. Yet we know this is not the case. Far too many people are dying in conflicts across the world. Far too many mothers are living in fear, unsure of the fate of their children. Far too many children are seeing their futures crumbling in front of them.
In Palestine, another year ends, with no permanent peace, no permanent hope. An independent, sovereign State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, established along the 1967 borders, is the only solution, the only way. Yet, many resolutions have been passed without action; many peace processes have been abandoned without progress. The shameful occupation by Israel continues, without consequence. Violence, economic depravation, fear, hunger and hopelessness  this is what a child in Palestine is born into. Generations have now matured, knowing nothing else. This must end.
In Syria, over a quarter of a million people have lost their lives, with many millions displaced and many more millions made refugees. War crimes have been committed. Chemical weapons used. Inhumane treatment normalised. This suffering must end.
Mr. President,
As hundreds of innocent people continue to flee the violence, conflict, and endless suffering  the greatest numbers since the World Wars  it has become imperative that we seek sustainable long-term solutions that address the wellbeing and welfare of migrants and refugees. Incidences of hatred, islamaphobia, and xenophobia  what has
2

become so frequent today  can only breed more violence, intolerance and hatred. Our policies of fences, force, and fear, must end.
In Myanmar, the situation of Rohingya Muslims, who are some of the most persecuted people in the world - presents another tragic case. Systemic violence, including massacres, torching of homes, forced displacement and forced migration  these acts of ethnic cleansing are alarming, to say the least. Those responsible for these barbaric actions must be brought to justice swiftly. These acts of prejudice, violence, and discrimination against Rohingya Muslims must end.
Instilling fear of ""the other"" is easy. Determining ""them"" as worth less  due to their religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, Islamaphobia, or whatever the reason  is a short step away. When this happens, it is easy to ignore grave violations, easier to even encourage them. It is then, and only then, we see  and we have seen  the worst of humanity. We cannot allow another wave of genocide to repeat. Not on our watch.
Mr. President,
Chaos, vacuum, and uncertainty, have given the opportunity for Dae'sh to start their own brand of terror, their own version of religion, and their own brutal methods of fear. Combatting terrorism, fighting violent extremism, and radicalisation, are national priorities. We have enacted a national legislation and formulated a comprehensive national policy in our fight against violence extremism. We have also established last year the National Centre for Counter Terrorism. It is a top priority for the Maldives. The Maldives is working with its bilateral and international partners, studying best practices, and forging common consensus. We commend the Secretary-General's efforts in achieving greater global coordination in the fight against terrorism. The establishment of a new Office of Counter Terrorism, we hope, will inject more energy in the implementation of the Plan of Action in Preventing Violent Extremism. The SecretaryGeneral will have our full support.
We must all do more. Today, we are in the midst of a war, like no other. This enemy has no single face, no single identity, no single country, and no single strategy. The only thing common is their brutal methods and their misplaced ideology. The fact that they kill more Muslims  the very people they allegedly fight to protect  proves their twisted reasoning. This terrorism, this extremism, must end.
In North Korea, the most recent tests of ballistic missiles, with them, the real threat of nuclear weapons and war, has alarmed us all. This is a clear violation of international law, an unnecessary act of provocation. There is every possibility now, that this could lead us down a path of destruction. We condemn these actions. We urge North Korea to return to dialogue, to let multilateralism take its course, to choose peace over war. These blatant attempts at aggression must end.

Mr President,
The world must become a more hopeful place for all  a place where people enjoy decent and meaningful lives.
Adopting a proactive and constructive stand is our approach. Sustained and targeted investment is our policy. Looking to cultivate a culture of respect for human rights, at home and abroad, is our goal. We believe we have been successful.
The Gender Equality Act has guaranteed in law, what Maldivians have been practising for decades - equality for women at home, at work, in decision-making, and in our society. Policies aiming at greater representation of women in leadership positions are showing results. Laws, policies, and regulations have created a framework where every man, every woman, every Maldivian can be a champion for gender equality. We need to do more  as all countries do, but we are proud of our considerable progress.
People with disabilities are supported through financial and material support. Our elderly population is getting the compassion and the financial support we owe them, through well-targeted policies.
Universal healthcare has been realised across the country, in all 188 islands. Easy access to a medical doctor, sea ambulances, and a pharmacy on every island are ensured. The Maldives spends more than nine percent of its GDP on health-related expenses  the highest in South East Asia region  an investment that has propelled us on our development path. Lymphatic filaria, measles, malaria, and polio  all of these diseases have been eradicated in the Maldives.
Access to safe, habitable, and affordable housing is recognised as a human right in the Constitution. Considerable progress has been made, with several housing units built and awarded under public housing schemes, despite the scarcity of land, and remoteness of islands.
Achieving near universal literacy, and universal enrolment in schools, has not stopped us. We are investing continually in improving the quality of our schools, our teachers, our curriculums and our approaches  to ensure that no-child is left behind.
We are also investing in our young people  the future of our nation. Caring for the physical, mental, and social wellbeing of our young people  the largest portion of our population  is a cornerstone of the Government's policy. We are focused on creating an enabling environment where they will thrive, where they will shine. Including through the promotion of unity, cultural values and national identity and national spirit, through programmes such as ""Tharika"" launched earlier this year.
Mr. President,
The Maldives is a middle-income country. But like every country, we want to achieve higher growth, and even greater development. For this to happen, large-scale investment
4

is necessary. Investments are not only a means to support our economic development, but a means to support our social development as well. Large-scale projects will help to provide economies of scale, facilitate expansion of key sectors of the economy, and also generate jobs, and create opportunities for our youth, for their creativity to be unleashed. Yet, it has become increasingly difficult for middle income countries like the Maldives to access concessional financing for development projects, leaving no choice but to go with commercial interest rates, further increasing debt burdens. This will undoubtedly make the transition, out of the middle income box to higher levels of development, all the more challenging. Our successes at home provide the basis for our solutions to the global problems that face our world. Our focus globally, has been to make sure we pay attention to those that are more vulnerable. This is why we believe that focusing on those that do not have a voice, and those that are not usually represented, making sure that their voices are heard, should be the international community's collective focus  as was ours during the six years we served on the United Nations Human Rights Council.
This is why we established at the Council, the Trust Fund to support the participation of LDCs and SIDS in the work of the Human Rights Council  two groups of countries vastly under-represented in Geneva. This is why our priority has been women, children, and the disabled. And introduced the link between climate change and its consequences on human rights. We worked hard to establish the Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment  a major global milestone.
Mr. President,
The world must be made a happier place to live in. And this can only be done through our collective will to approach the common problems we face, with concrete solutions.
And there is no bigger global threat than that of climate change. In 1987 when the Maldives first spoke about sea level rise, the science was still new, the threat relatively unknown. We persisted in our advocacy  because we believed that the threat of climate change deserved, and indeed, needed global attention. The Maldives hosted, in 1989, the first international conference on small states and sea level rise. We helped form the Alliance of Small Island States, one of the most influential groups on climate change and sustainable development  a group that we have chaired since 2015. The Maldives negotiated, in 2008, the first UN resolution on human rights and climate change  the first time a UN document acknowledged this link.
Today, the threat of climate change is very real. Unpredictable weather, more frequent and intense natural disasters, unprecedented temperatures, are the norm rather than the exception. The unprecedented frequency and the intensity of the recent hurricanes to hit the Caribbean and the United States, and the Pacific islands last year  are all powerful signs that our planet has changed significantly.
Island nations  including the Maldives  are the first to be devastated by these impacts. But, we are not the only ones. Today, climate change is becoming a reality for the rest of
5

the world  whether we choose to believe it or not. Here, I would like to take a moment to express our sincere sympathies to those affected by recent Hurricanes Jose, Irma and Maria. I assure you, we will not stop our advocacy on climate change.
We have proposed many solutions. The full implementation of the Paris Agreement is our priority. The reduction of harmful emissions, transitioning to renewable sources of energy, and investing in mitigation and adaptation are also crucial. We need to join together, in meaningful and durable partnerships, to find sustainable solutions. We need constructive engagement, leadership and a certain degree of openness to change, from all countries  developing and developed. Leadership like we are seeing from China, Brazil, India, Canada, France, Germany, and countless others.
At home, we are investing in renewable energy, through the transition to a low carbon economy. The Maldives, as the Chair of AOSIS, and in collaboration with IRENA, we have launched the Initiative for Renewable Island Energy (IRIE), which will facilitate support for Small Island States in their transition to renewable energy, and in achieving energy efficiency. We are looking at innovative approaches to fulfil the developmental needs of our people that do not compromise the needs of our planet. We have lent our voice and shared our experience. We have requested support to make our economy, and our country more resilient to the shocks and impacts caused by climate change.
Taking care of our ocean is intimately linked to meaningful action on climate change. The Maldives, and other island nations are custodians of large expanses of ocean. Yet, every person in this room, every community you represent, every country you come from  derives benefits from our ocean, is dependent, on the health and wealth of our ocean and seas. Every other breath we take comes from the ocean.
In the Maldives, the ocean is the backbone and the artery of our two main economic sectors  fisheries and tourism. The ocean defines who the Maldivians are  traditional seafarers, fishing communities, reliant on the produce that the ocean offers to us. This is why we welcomed, and actively engaged in the first UN Oceans Conference held earlier this year. This is why we have preserved  despite the hardships  our traditional method of pole-and-line fishing  the most well recognised, the cleanest, greenest and most sustainable method of fisheries. Catching fish one-by-one with almost no by-catch. This is why since 2010, our entire Exclusive Economic Zone  nearly one million square kilometres, has been declared a shark sanctuary  a measure we call on other countries to follow, as the current Chair of the ""Save Our Sharks"" Coalition. This is why an entire atoll is a UNESCO recognised biosphere reserve, with many other marine areas protected and preserved. In fact, there are many more uninhabited islands with marine protected areas than populated islands in the Maldives. This is why the total ban on exploitation of ecologically significant marine creatures such as turtles, whales, dolphins, rays, and whale sharks is strictly enforced. At the same time, Maldivians are some of the largest consumers of fish and fisheries products, demonstrating to the world that sustainable utilization of the marine resources is indeed possible.
We must not forget those that suffer the consequences of natural disasters. We are witnessing the total destruction and loss of life the Earthquake in Mexico is causing. We
6

must endeavour, as an international community, to do our very best for them, and for many others that suffer around the world in disasters. And focus on cultivating resilience by building back better.
Climate change, sustainable development, and the protection of our ocean  these are not trends or passing fascinations  inaction would cost us our progress, prosperity, and the lives of our people  the future of all our nations.
This is not the time to question what we already know. This is not the time to turn inwards or look the other way. There is no time to waste. It is time to act.
Mr President,
Two days ago, we celebrated fifty-two proud years as a member of the United Nations.
Throughout our membership in the past five decades, we have worked with a vision of a United Nations that protects people  providing them with a safe haven, and access to their rights  A United Nations that preserves our planet  prioritising the needs of our present generation without compromising those of the future  A United Nations that promotes peace  free of fear, full of bright tomorrows, and an abundance of hope.
We have focused on providing meaningful, pragmatic, real solutions, based on sound national experience, for our common shared destiny.
It is because we have a meaningful vision to promote that we continue to make every effort to the common cause of humanity.
Mr. President,
It is because of our firm belief in the power of multilateralism, the same faith that propelled us  fifty-two years ago  to seek membership of the United Nations  the very first foreign policy decision of the independent Maldives  that pushes us to be effective members of the international community.
It is because we have never served before  It is the promise of equality of representation, our conviction that every nation  large or small  should have a voice, and can make a difference  our firm conviction that size does not determine destiny or value, that in our fifty-two years of membership of the United Nations, for the first time, we are seeking a seat on the United Nations Security Council for the term 2019-2020.
We stand tall, and proud because we believe that we have much to offer  fresh perspectives, fresh ideas, and new concepts, to bring renewed dynamism, and new approaches to the United Nations.
The Maldives deserves an equal chance to serve this international body. We are dedicated to the cause of peace in a sustainable world. And we are determined to leave a mark, and make a difference.
7

The triumph of multilateralism, the pinnacle of our common vision, lies in our collective approach to solving the global challenges of our time. The Maldives stands ready to take that leap of faith, providing shared solutions, for our shared, common destiny. I thank you Mr President.

Malta,"Mr President,
There can be no peace while poverty, especially extreme poverty, still exists.
Peace is not just the absence of war or conflict. It is rather, managing and addressing climate change, migration, and food and water insecurity.
The UN instrument that weaves the sustainment of peace together with the universal challenges is Agenda 2030.
On these lines, the Maltese Presidency of the Council of the European Union worked arduously and successfully with other European Union Member States towards a new European Consensus on Development, that encompasses the Global Development Agenda through a resolute plan of action to eradicate poverty.
Never has it been more urgent to preserve humanity's future. Agenda 2030 is the first marker towards achieving our sustainable development goals. All segments of society need to be on board for us to deliver such an onerous task.
As Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth I would like to highlight the strong commitment of the organisation and its role towards the realisation of the SDGs. We represent 52 different realities, which has led us to launch, in broad terms, a number of common initiatives to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs.
On a national level, Malta is taking action.
We have registered a voluntary commitment of 30% of all the waters under Maltese jurisdiction as Marine Protected Areas. As is well known, Malta has internationally been at the forefront of maritime and marine related issues. It was exactly 50 years ago that Malta's first Permanent Representative to the rAN, the late Arvid Pardo, made his famous speech in this very Chamber a speech that triggered the negotiations of the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention. It is in a similar spirit, that we support the valuable work being carried out towards achieving an international legally-binding instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyong national jurisdiction. It is indeed crucial to finally bring legal protection to the high seas' biodiversity.
On our part, we will continue contributing towards the good governance of the oceans by hosting the next 'Our Ocean 2017 Conference' in Malta next month. Furthermore, we fully support the setting up of an Intergovernmental Panel on Ocean Governance reporting to the General Assembly through the Secretary General.

I also wish to underline the recent initiative undertaken by the Commonwealth to develop a 'Blue Charter' that is to assist Commonwealth countries to meet the requirements borne by SDG14.
Likewise, we wholeheartedly welcome the entry into force last November of the Paris Climate Accord. It is only through the greening of our actions that we can ensure sustainable development that is complimentary and respectful to mother earth. Malta, together with all the EU partners, is strongly committed to the Paris Agreement.
As a Government we base our policies on four overarching principles: social mobility, social justice, equality and unity. Just today we have learnt that in Malta less people are at risk of poverty, following a drive by our government to distribute fairly the proceeds coming from sustained growth. This is an achievement which is as dear to us as our record sexing economic growth and minimal unemployment levels. This is exactly what we work for, our raison d'etre, which we describe as prosperity with a purpose.
A prosperous future needs to be accompanied by an inclusive society. People who live in fear or are oppressed or discriminated against cannot realize their potential and are not at peace. Malta seeks to lead by example, seeking to have equality as a hallmark of our legacy.
We have put human rights, equality and the empowerment at the forefront of our political agenda, and in particular on the priority issues of LGBTIQ rights and gender equality. We redefined marriage to grant full equality and a fair gender neutral essence. All this has been complemented by amendments to our Constitution to protect against discrimination on the basis of 'sexual orientation' and 'gender identity'. These individual choices should be as significant as the colour of one's eyes.
The economic and political empowerment of our citizens, regardless of their gender is a priority for us. We have been gradually introducing measures to help reconcile work and familial responsibilities. We are proud to be the only European country to provide universal free childcare to all working people, an initiative which has liberated the potential of so many women in our society. We want to ensure more gender-balanced political representation coupled with recent initiatives to increase youth participation by lowering voting age in general and European elections from 18 to t 6, after already lowered voting age in local elections.
Malta, despite its small size, can now serve as a beacon of political courage that inspires others to introduce concrete measures and reforms. Everyone must feel empowered in today's society. The protection of marginalized and vulnerable persons is a must if we are to strive for an inclusive world.

The UN is pivotal in all this. It must continue to spearhead, sustain and mobilize the international community as we journey along this ambitious path to 2030.
But so much more remains to be done.
The exploitation of human misery knows no boundaries. Migrant smuggling and human trafficking by criminal groups are globally prevalent and Malta very much witnesses this close to home along the central Mediterranean route.
As a Member State of the European Union, Malta is part of a wider European response to tackle human trafficking networks in the Mediterranean Sea. However, national and even regional action is insufficient without a global response.
Malta welcomes the progress registered on the development of a global compact on Migration. This should, yes, reaffirm States' sovereign right to decide their immigration policies, but it should also commit States to build migration systems and institutions that operate in a timely manner, so that migrants are treated fairly and with dignity; protect migrants' human rights and create awareness against exploitation and modem slavery; and lead campaigns against xenophobia whilst providing support for the integration of long-term migrants. It is also our belief that whereas the Global Compact for Migrants would encompass these measures to facilitate orderly, safe, and regular migration, it should also commit States, particularly those of origin and transit, to take action to reduce illegal and unmanaged migration.
Challenging times require us to be on time for the challenge. That time is now, sooner rather than later. Purposeful and systematic action by multi-stakeholders, at all levels and across all strata is crucial if the ensuing benefits are to be felt by the people in all the comers of the world. The UN is the prime mobilizer and anchor of international peace, security and stability has a quintessential role to play, if we are to secure a peaceful, sustainable and a better world for all.
We are strong believers in the overarching power of multilateralism. We do not believe the UN is simply a sum of its parts, but rather a force that grows exponentially when we think and act as one, rather than alone."
Marshall_Islands,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excelle: cies,i Ladies & Gentlemen,
I have the honor to convey the warm greeting ofokwe on behalf 0fthe government and people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
Mr. President,
I congratulate you on your election, and I n proud that your predecessor from the Pacific, Peter Thomson, will continue his service to the UN s the oceans envoy.
I also extend the condolences of nay govemm mt for the destruction and tragic loss from recent natural disasters in Mexico, the United States, Pmtigu & Barbuda, Cuba, Haiti, the Bahamas, Dominica, Haiti, the territories of the US and British Virgin I .andgl Puerto Rico, St. Barth, Amguilla, Turks & Caicos, and other islands.
M: President,
The United Nations stands strong as the onl"" place that we - all of us in the world, have to meet our starkest challenges together. Even if preseni moments in the world appear uncertain, all must remain confident and committed to ensure this body ill speak for those who might not otherwise have such a
voice.
Mr, President,
Recent events regarding North Korea and it'., growing nuclear threat must serve as an obvious mandate for strong and urgent global cooperation an effective action. The Marshall Islands is a small island nation in the Pacific - and, by oreselves, w wish for only peace, security and stability for the world. We cannot ignore the sudden and evident thr, at tolthe territory of Guam, our close neighbor, friend, and the home of some of our Marshallese citizer . Aithreat posed to Guam is a threat to the wider Pacific Islands region. And we further express our s :rious concern for the challenges these actions have posed to the peace, security and political cooperati( n across the wider Pacific rim,

The government of the Republic of the Mar aall ilslands at it's highest levels loudly condemns the recent nuclear test of September 3rd, and relat, d actions - without debate, these are clear violations of UN Security Resolutions, and are serious hallenges to the international disarmament and nonproliferation regime based on the Treaty on N n-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I am appalled that - of all countries - the Marshall Islands - is a in facing the very real threat of an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific ocean.
Mr. President,
The Republic of the Marshall Islands has con, mngd these testing efforts not just for our own security, but because we kaaow the impacts firsthand. 'he 67 nuclear tests in my country - conducted between 1946 md 1958 - have produced a legacy bur n w}fich we hope no other nation or people should ever have to bear. These tests were conducted und our UN Trusteeship - a time when this institution was charged with. our welfare and well-being. henI our Marshallese leaders traveled to New York to present two petitions to urgently halt nuclea testing - in 1954 and 1956 - the UN responded with Trusteeship Resolutions 1082 and 1493, whi( h are the only time my UN organ has ever specifically authorized nuclear tests. The consequences ot this !gnorance were - and are - beyond horrific.
Our people and environment have suffered ts no other people should - and these legacy impacts remain today as stark and present challenges, assed down through generations of mother to daughter, father to son. For these reasons, the UN Spe, al Rapporteur on Human Rights & Toxic Waste in 2012 outlined clear human rights implications and i :sponsibitities - Which we affirm.
Mr. Secretary-General, I thank you for your h .er to the Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum this August, stating t,hat ""finding a solution to this issue s critical for the future of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and assuring us that relevant UNent ies stand ready to respond to requests for assistance.
Mr. President,
Recent events should create far greater politfl tl resolve to curb and ultimately eliminate global nuclear threats. But if it were a task so easily done, p :rha!s the world would not have struggled for so long. In this regard, the Republic of the Marshall Isla: ds supports those nations who are now able to affirm the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapor , and we will continue to add our own voice in all fora, including the CTBT and NPT. We are corn nitted to a close and inclusive examination of our own participation in the Nuclear Ban treaty, lister ng c!osely to our stakeholders and affected communities, and also taking into account any possible i @ications on our mutual security relationships. It will always remain our fervent hope that such w apoSs of mass destruction shall never again be tested or unleashed, and that all nuclear-armed nations rill have the necessary political wilt to disarm.
Mr. President,
Earlier this year, my country experienced tt tragic loss of our Iongtime Minister and climate change Ambassador Tony deBrum, and I wish to press my gratitude for those who have conveyed their condolences. Tony once said that for the !arshalt Islands, ""we are suffering the effects of climate change and of the nuclear legacy, and we ve liad nothing to do with either. In either case, people have to choose to end this world, this univen, You can either do it slowlY with climate change, or you can press a button and blow it up, and neithe is justified.""

Mr. President,
Just across from the United Nations, in the E :t River, there sits Belmont Island - a small, rocky little beacon only 1 meter tall. This island in New York must now be a reminder for the world's diplomats that if you ever see it vanish in the rising sea - know that you have also lost the Marshall Islands, and the Pacific.
Mr. President,
Climate change is real - no credible scientist v oulcbe able to make a sound claim otherwise. But what we see with our own eyes in our low-lying isl ads reveals a real, present and growing threat to our own survival and security as a nation and member f the UN. We welcome the Paris Agreement's entry into force. This still stands as a truly lasting, arab :iousl, long-term agreement - and we must not allow our mutual confidence to be thrown off by any .lortqterm bumps. We urge further ratification and full participation in the Montreal Protocol's Kigali kmehdment - which was a legacy and the persona! drive of the late Minister-in-Assistance to the Pro :ident of the Marshall Islands, Mattlan Zackhras, who tragically and suddenly passed away last monl . A the end of a long night of negotiations last year, the late Minister Zackhras said it would be a prou ca!i home to his children the night the amendment was adopted. He said that because he knew the gali Amendment could mean the difference between if our country- and their future - would exist - r not.
Mr. President,
We strongly support the leadership our Paci: isiand neighbor Fiji as the incoming President of the UNFCCC's Conference of Parties, and unde: their trust and guidance all parties will adopt a strong rulebook. The Paris agreement is only as stror g as the political confidence which stands behind it - and it is beyond imperative that, even in thes : early moments, committed nations are starting the challenging task of pushing ourselves to do ex m more.
! Even with our limited resources, the Marshal Islands is committed not only to implementation, but to explore where our own action on energy ca1 be strengthened - and if we can do it, so can everyone else. We must match our own ambition ot emissions with stronger approaches, and close bilateral work, which better ensures that we are bui ling i infrastructure for a truly resilient future -tO look beyond the distant multilateral resolutions, ar t knw with eyidence that we and our partners are giving our youngest and future generations every ol ce Of effort to leave with them a legacy worthy of their trust.
Mr. President,
The Republic of the Marshall Islands stron ly agrees with the widespread call from the large and growing chorus of our fellow member state - that a more effective and efficient United Nations is beyond necessary. We support the Secretar -General to act, under his own authority, to continue to initiate practical but powerful efforts to redu :e dtiplication, and improve delivery. These are not only about the use of public funds - including o : own - but also about all of us improving our ability to achieve our full potential, and making clear p ogress towards the SDGs. We cannot do it alone, and we cannot do it with an international architectul wtich, however good the intentions, has too often lost the focus needed to help us make the c mec[ions between these powerful halls and our local communities.

Before we engage in an impossible fight over souces, we must first examine the use of the resources already at hand. Our small in-country joJ at presence office struggles with access to seasoned international staff to help us learn to navigat : the!system. Our UNDP Resident CQordinator for the Marshall Islands is actually a resident of ant Lher ation nearly - 3 thousand kilometers away. This resident coordinator, who is fully dedicated t( her ission, is also tasked with being coordinator of 8 other remote island nations - where she also s not a resident. We must reexamine the management decisions which led to this outcome. Smal! island developing states will realize serious barriers to implementing the SDGs without a stronger foc s from the UN system.

Mr. President,

This past June's UN Conference on Oceans an SDG 14 stands as a watershed moment ofpolitica! will. But these good words too often fall short in g )hal and regional decisions on oceans and fisheries. The Pacific small island developing states have s, unded the alarm on the state of world oceans which all have heard - but not loud enough. We have the potential in the Pacific, as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement and beyond, to effect a step-chanl e in the world tuna market - to dramatically change our own economic trajectory, and boost global fo, d security along the way. The UN system itself must do
far more to help us focus closely on this transt )traCtive opportunity.

And even if some of our partners are still slc v to '.rise with us, the marketplace is already leading the way. And what the Pacific region is doing fo] tuna - to boost sustainable practices and ensure our own participation at the same time - we are als , doing with wider oceans. Increasingly, our political partners will come to find that our political s lppot wilt rest closely not upon their own pressure, but the extent of their political will to follow ou lea On sustainable oceans and fisheries. And while it may be our own Pacific economic and enviro me1{tal survival at stake, it is also a finn push to the rest of the world to ensure that two third's of our t; anetls surface is no longer in peril.

i
Mr. President, i

If indeed no one is to be left behind in the SD }s, ad to fulfill our UN Charter, than we should consider

that the exclusion of Taiwan from the UN a1 d it'sl related agencies has created a major challenges for

both the government and people of Taiwan ir thei{ pursuit of their fundamental right to participate. As

in my own nation; Taiwan is an indispensat le pm-tner for the international community, including on

humanitarian aid, medical assistance, diseas preqention, environmental protection, anti-terrorism and

achieve global benefit tlzrough universal parti :ipation, including at ICAO, the UNFCCC and the WHO.

UN resolution 2758 of !971 has been mist ed o justify an exclusion which has not only literally

denied access to the people of Taiwan from e terig these doors, but steps over a powerful opportunity

to work together with a proactive contribute : to i3eace and the common global good. As the United

Mr. President,

E

These may be trying times, and the challeng s of the world are severe - but it is in such adversity that

true character is defined - and if an effective 3nited Nations was ever truly needed, it is now. We must

look outward to embrace the communityo nations, rather than took inward towards our own self-

interest at the expense of everyone else. Mu] lateral engagement must be our guiding light as we move

towards a more effectiveand efficient UN.

Thank you and kommol tata."
Mauritius,"Mr. President,
Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,
Let me begin by expressing my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the people and
govemment of Mexico following the devastating earthquake which has taken the lives of
hundreds of men, women and children. Mr. President,
It is a great honour for me to address the United Nations General Assembly for the first time as the Prime Minister of Mauritius. I am here today to reaffirm my country's continued commitment to the universal values ofthis organization.
Mr. President,
Congratulations on your election as the President of the seventy second session of the General Assembly. I assure you of our total support as you steer the work of this
assembly.
The six priorities that you have identified under the theme of focusing on people echo
our own aspirations as a nation. Mr. President,
Warm congratulations to H.E. Mr. Antonio Guterres, on his appointment as the new UN
Secretary-General. I commend him for the multidimensional vision he has for the UN
and for the process he has initiated on the repositioning of the United Nations Development System to effectively and efficiently deliver on the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development.
We also welcome the consultative process he has initiated with Member states in that regard. We fully support his initiative and encourage him to make a more pronounced


use of modern communication technology and of local capacity in the implementation of UN sponsored projects. We also appreciate his view that this reform is but part of a larger reform of the UN System, including the revltalization of the role of the UN General Assembly. Mr. President,
The last time there was a reform of the Security Council was in 1965. This is more than 50 years ago. Membership then was at 117. We now stand at 193. The Security Council needs to reflect these changes and this has to be done at the earliest.
I believe the time has now come for us to proceed with text based negotiations to be concluded within an agreed timeframe.
The African position on this matter, which has so far not been challenged, can with appropriate additions, provide a basis for these negotiations. Mauritius fully supports the EzulwinI Consensus and Africa's aspiration for a more pronounced role in the Security Council. For too long, Africa has been left on the side when it comes to global governance. It is time to correct this gross injustice.
We also fully support India's aspiration for a seat on the Security Council. We equally believe that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must play a more prominent role in the Security Council and their call for a dedicated non-permanent seat is legitimate and
appropriate. Mr. President, Maintenance of peace and security requires tremendous and constant effort,
negotiation, understanding and compromise. Mauritius voted in favour of the resolution adopting the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons last July and we hope to see


complete denuclearisation throughput the world. We urge all those involved in potential conflicts around the world, especially where there is a possibility of nuclear weapons being used, to exercise restraint and promote dialogue instead of belligerent posturing
that feeds unrest and dangerous escalation.
We urge restraint and dialogue in Myanmar where violence continues to displace thousands of people and has caused numerous victims. We make ah appeal for
unrestricted provision of humanitarian assistance to all those affected. We also call for
the early implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on the Rakhine State in view of finding a long lasting solution.
Mr. President, Despite our best efforts, terrorism continues to claim innocent lives and undermines the
sovereignty of States. We condemn terrorism in all its forms wherever they occur and we stand in solidarity with the governments and peoples which are victims of terrorism. We congratulate the Secretary-General for establishing the UN Office of CounterTerrorism. We expect this new Office to provide leadership, coordination and coherence, to strengthen capacity-building assistance to Member States, and to improve the visibility, advocacy and resource mobilization for UN counter-terrorism
efforts. We also need to address the root causes of this scourge and we expect this
office to provide valuable input in that regard.
Mr. President,
The situation in the Middle East and plight of the Palestinian people continue to be issues of great
concern. We call on all sides to sincerely start talks for a peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue. Mauritius has always supported the two states solution with Palestine


and Israel living peacefully side by side. An independent and viable Palestine is more likely to provide security both to Israel and the region.
Mr. President, Mauritius highly values the importance of its integration within Africa and believes in the universal benefits of the continental integration of Africa. The Agenda 2063 of the African Union adopted in January 2015 is in consonance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and provides a strategy for development that is peopledriven and respectful of the rule of law. This vision of Africa will be carried by its people and its youth. Today Africa is home to
a growing youthful population, and is experiencing increased urbanization. Along with the digital transformation of the continent, improving infrastructure and connectivity, and its rich wind, hydro and solar capacity, Africa has the potential of becoming a beacon for sustainable development. It is geared to become a driver of economic growth and a huge consumer market.
Mr. President,
Last July the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) met to review the status of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda two years after its adoption. I wish to congratulate the 44 countries which presented their voluntary national reviews. In Mauritius, a coordinating mechanism has been set up for the implementation of SDGs. We are in the process of consultations with the Private Sector, Civil Society and other stakeholders and we expect to submit our Voluntary National Review at the next
HLPF in 2018.
Mr. President,
Addressing Climate Change is central and critical to the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. With the increasing number and intensity of climate related disasters


- storms, droughts, flash floods, to name but a few - it would be naive on our part to dismiss the Climate Change.
We have just recently witnessed the devastating violence of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. I would like to express my Government's deep sympathy and solidarity to
Governments and peoples of the islands in the Caribbean and the United States for the loss of lives in the devastating trails of these hurricanes.
Mr. President,
Mitigating the effects of Climate Change and effectively implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction will require substantial effort and resources,
especially for SIDS, if we want to be more resilient to these natural calamities. While we
welcome the generous pledges made so far, including the creation of the Green Climate Fund, we need to streamline and simplify the procedures for SIDS to access these funds, especially in the light of the recent events.
Mr. President,
This year's HLPF recognized the specific challenges of SIDS and MICs. Classification as a 'Middle Income Country' makes SIDS like Mauritius ineligible for most of the Official Development Assistance (ODA) and concessional funding. MICs are often victims of their success in graduating from LDC status and run the risk of getting stuck in the middle income trap. SIDS MICs like Mauritius aspire to be partners in development rather than mere recipients of ODA. With the help of the United Nations Development System and other partners as well as the provision of tailor made programmes, these countries can contribute to the sharing of experience and knowledge with countries aspiring to graduate from the LDC status and consolidate our own economic development at the
same time.


Mr. President, Oceans are of vital Importance to SIDS. Mauritius, with its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of over 2.3 million square kilometres, is a large ocean state. This is why my government has developed an Ocean Strategy comprising of fisheries, tourism, deep ocean water applications as well as resource exploration and exploitation. We call on our partners to assist us in implementing this strategy as expressed in paragraph 130
of the Call for Action of the UN Oceans Conference. Mr. President
Mauritius is honoured to co-Chair the High Level Panel on Water (SDG6) co-convened by the former UN Secretary General and the World Bank President. The Panel met today to take stock of the progress achieved following the adoption of its Action Plan last September which called for a transformative approach to the management of water resources. The outcome package of the Panel is expected to make concrete proposals for the achievement of the targets of SDG6 and we hope that all world leaders will support it.
Mr. President,
Adherence to intemational law, safeguard of fundamental human rights and respect for the territorial integrity of countries underpin relations between countries. In relation to Mauritius, all these principles were flouted when an integral part of its territory, namely the Chagos Archipelago, was excised prior to our independence, in violation of international law, including obligations reflected in UN Resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 2066 (XX) of 16 December 1965, and all the inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago were forcibly evicted. Our decolonization still remains to be completed, five decades after the adoption of the Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.


Mr. President,
A crucial role of the International Court of Justice is to provide guidance, through its advisory opinions, to the organs and agencies of our Organization for the fulfilment of
their responsibilities.
It is in this spirit that Member States of the Group of African States tabled last June a resolution seeking an Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965. We are very pleased that the resolution was adopted, and indeed by such a resounding majority. That vote demonstrated the great importance that the Member States from across the globe - not just Africa, but also Europe, Asia and the Americas - attach to
the need to complete the process of decolonization, as well as the concern they have for the injustices caused to the evicted inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago. As a matter of fact, this overwhelming vote has renewed their hope that they might finally
return to their place of birth. The UN membership has indeed made it clear that it wishes to see the decolonization process of Mauritius completed, and to that end has turned to the International Court of
Justice for guidance. We are hopeful that the Court's Advisory opinion will not only
guide the important work of the General Assembly but will also allow Mauritius to move fon/vard, including with an appropriate program in favour of the inhabitants who had been displaced from that part of the Mauritian territory. Many of you had an opportunity, last June, to see an exhibition on the tragedy surrounding that eviction and to interact
with those who were forced to leave in such inhumane conditions. Mr. President,
We thank the Member States for their support and look forward to their continued
support in the completion of our decolonization.


In this regard, we express the hope that as many Member States as possible will contribute to the proceedings which the Court has invited them to participate in.
Mr. President,
Let me take this opportunity to reaffirm that Mauritius does not have any intention of seeking the disruption of the security arrangements currently in place in Diego Garcia,
the biggest island of the Chagos Archipelago. Let me reiterate what successive Mauritian governments have clearly stated: ""Mauritius is willing to enter into a long-term renewable lease with the United States to allow these security arrangements to remain in place"". In this regard, completing the process of decolonization will enhance security by providing legality and certainty.
Mr. President,
With regard to Tromelin, which has always formed and continues to form an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, we appreciate the constructive progress made with
France, including the agreement reached in 2010.
Mr. President
We have an opportunity during this current session of the General Assembly to commit ourselves to the agreements and decisions that would considerably improve the lives of ordinary people all around the world. As we prepare to hand over this planet for later generations, let me renew our commitment to strive for a world, where peace, security and prosperity do not remain just distant dreams.

Thank you.

***********************"
Micronesia_(Federated_States_of),"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me at the outset congratulate you, Mr. President, on assuming your role as presiding officer over this august body. I also congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji for a job well done for the past year. I must also mention our distinguished Secretary-General Mr. Antonio Guterres. In the few months since attaining the leadership of our Organization, he has already shown himself to be more than equal to the tremendous tasks associated with his high office.
As we gather here today in this great Hall of the United Nations, natural disasters and calamities are striking in many parts of our world. Hurricanes, typhoons and earthquakes have devastated communities and displaced thousands of people in just these past few days. To the victims and families around the world, I offer our sympathies and condolences on behalf of the people and the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia.
We condemn the loss of innocent lives to terrorist attacks. Micronesia pledges its resolve to stand united against terrorism in solidarity with affected nations. On behalf of the Micronesian Government and people, I offer our deepest condolences to all those nations and families who have suffered losses at the hands of terrorists.
Mr. President,
As we witness recent record-breaking ""mega storms"", we cannot ignore the connections to climate change, especially to ocean warming and sea-level rise. In the wake of these devastating events, we must not only stay committed to our collective fight against climate change, we must double our efforts.

Climate change is one of the most serious threats to global peace and security, threatening the very existence of our islands. It needs to be at the top of the agenda of the General Assembly. As the United Nations undertakes efforts to reorient around the priorities of peace and prevention, the UN system will have to adapt. In this regard, we reiterate our call for the appointment of a Special Representative on Climate Change and Security.
Climate change mitigation is also essential to achieve the goals and targets of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, including eradication of poverty, ending hunger, building resilient infrastructure and shared prosperity. Without progress in fighting climate change, our sustainable development efforts will be futile. This is particularly true for small island developing states.
The Paris Agreement has provided an avenue to enhance cooperation in our fight against climate change, and the world must seize the moment. Micronesia expresses grave concern that some countries have chosen to break with the international community and neglect the Paris Agreement, contrary to all of the best scientific advice. As a small island developing nation at the forefront of the battle, Micronesia calls on all States to fully engage in global efforts to implement the Paris Agreement, to support the Green Climate Fund, and to contribute innovative climate solutions.
Mr. President,
I would like to share with you a story of global cooperation at its finest. This is a story of a treaty that was designed to save the ozone layer - and succeeded - but has also ended up making a major contribution to climate change mitigation.
The Montreal Protocol is considered the most successful multilateral environmental treaty of all time. That is why the 194 parties to the Protocol met last year in Kigali, Rwanda and agreed to amend the Montreal Protocol and expand its scope. Specifically, the Kigali Amendment allows the Protocol to regulate HFCs, which are chemicals used in refrigeration and air conditioning that can contribute significantly to global warming. Phasing down the use of HFCs will help avoid 0.5 degrees Celsius of global temperature rise, and complementary energy efficiency measures in this same sector could help avoid another 0.5 degrees of warming.
We thank the parties to the Montreal Protocol who have already ratified the Kigali Amendment, totaling eight out of the twenty needed for the agreement to enter into force. We call on the other parties to ratify the agreement as soon as possible, ideally before the next Meeting of the Parties in Canada in November.
Along with the Paris Agreement, the Kigali Amendment is a major step towards survival of small island states. As the story of the Kigali Amendment demonstrates, with intelligence, perseverance, and cooperation, we can achieve anything. This is the motivation that keeps us all working together for a better future.
2

Mr. President,
In the islands, we say the ocean is us, as we are the ocean.
As an island nation, Micronesia fully supported and participated actively in the UN Ocean Conference in June. The Call for Action from that conference, entitled ""Our Ocean, Our Future,"" highlights the actions required to achieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 14. Micronesia supports the intent to organize a second UN Ocean Conference in 2020. This will enable us to follow-up on the commitments made at the first conference and to assess our progress towards full implementation of SDG14 by 2030. We look forward to the work of the Special Envoy for the Ocean to maintain the momentum.
At the recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in Samoa, our leaders endorsed ""The Blue Pacific"" identity as the core driver of collective action in the Pacific region. This was a fitting progression from last year's ""Pohnpei Oceans Statement"", as elements of The Blue Pacific narrative reinforce the potential for shared stewardship of the Pacific Ocean.
We must now show ambition in tackling the mounting threats to the health of our Ocean. The special case of small island developing states must be enshrined in the forthcoming implementing agreement under the 10N Law of the Sea Convention on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (or ""BBNJ""). We welcome the successful conclusion of the Preparatory Committee, and now we must urgently launch and conclude the intergovernmental conference to draft and adopt a new legally binding agreement.
Mr. President,
For Pacific islands, fisheries are a mainstay of our economies, our most important renewable natural resource and an integral part of our sustainable development plans. Effective conservation and management of our tuna resources is not only important for us who depend on it for our livelihoods and sustainable development but also for addressing global food security concerns. We must remain steadfast in our efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in all its forms.
I also want to take this opportunity to express our concerns about the lack of recognition, and respect, of the rights of coastal states such as Micronesia to manage fisheries in their own exclusive economic zones. In the Western and Central Pacific, some developed country fishing nations, are advocating for flag based rights in regional fisheries management organizations. Such measures would undermine existing zone based management measures and erode the ability of small island developing states as resource owners to exercise their sovereign rights under international law. This would not be an acceptable outcome. Therefore, we call on these developed country partners to withdraw all such proposals and to actively support the efforts of small island developing states to increase benefits from the sustainable management of fisheries in their EEZs.

Mr. President,
Allow me to briefly thank our Secretary-General for his proposals on the peace and security architecture, management reform and other reform processes of our Organization. We commend his proposals that will result in a more transparent, efficient and effective regime that can respond to the challenges our world is facing today. Our United Nations must be fit for purpose. While reforms are vital to any Organization, they must leave no one behind and must not disadvantage small island developing states.
For many years now, a small island developing state like mine has also paid priority attention to the efforts to reform the United Nations Security Council. But the countless hours spent meeting and stating and re-stating positions have resulted in little progress. We need to break out of this cycle. It is high time to shift to real negotiations.
Mr. President,
In the Western Pacific, and most especially in our greater Micronesian region, the provocative and aggressive actions by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) pose a threat to regional security and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Micronesia supports the actions taken by the Security Council. We call on the Council and countries with the power and influence to help resolve this crisis to take action immediately to ensure peace is achieved on the Korean Peninsula.
In conclusion,
We gather in this great Hall and debate among nations, but we are speaking for our peoples. We are trying to advance their interests. We are seeking to improve their lives. As history has taught us, we will all fail our nations and our peoples unless we work together for the common good. Consistent with that principle, the theme of this session of the General Assembly is Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet.
We must believe in such a future and strive towards it together. Multilateralism and the United Nations are more important than ever. Only together can we restore and maintain peace and security. Only together can we overcome the threat of global climate change. Only together can we build a sustainable future for the planet and all of our peoples.
Thank you."
Montenegro,"Dear President, Distinguished Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to address you at the 72nd Session of the General Assembly and reiterate a strong commitment of Montenegro to the values of the United Nations.
As one of the newest members of the United Nations, Montenegro actively contributes to maintaining peace and security in the region. Good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation in the Balkans are on the top our foreign policy agenda. We are strongly committed to multilateral cooperation and affirmation of the international organizations that contribute to the peace and stability. It is of great importance for Montenegro that it became the 29th member of the North Atlantic Alliance.
As a member of the Alliance, we will continue to improve its cooperation and partnership with the UN peace-keeping missions and regional organizations dedicated to establishing and maintaining the peace and stability. At the same time, Montenegro has proved to be a reliable partner of the European Union. Accession negotiations have already ensured significant economic benefits.
International community is faced with the complex challenges such as long-term conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism, refugee crises, systematic violation of human rights, poverty. The United Nations, which are established to prevent war and human suffering, should make more rapid adjustments to respond to these challenges and adopt new mechanisms to prevent conflicts and resolve long-term crisis.
The United Nations and international as well as regional economic organizations have new responsibilities. Peace, stability, achieving sustainable and inclusive growth and improvement of international economic relations are the basic elements for achieving the goals set in the 2030 Agenda. Therefore, it is highly important to carry out a successful implementation of the reform process of the United Nations and its affiliations -IMF and World Bank- for achieving a more equitable economic growth- poverty eradication, women's economic empowerment and bridging the technological gap between countries and regions.
Montenegro remains dedicated to the UN efforts in implementation of the ambitious reform agenda, including the strengthening of the role of the General Assembly an enlargement of the Security Council according to the principles of equitable regional representation. Successful cooperation between Montenegro and the UN system

continues in the framework of the program ""Acting as One"". Positive results of this program are visible and recognized by many UN member states.
Montenegro is a part of the region whose experience has shown that dialogue and cooperation are possible and that they are the only way to overcome the differences and achieve peace and lasting solutions. Therefore, we will organize, early next year, a regional conference, in order to share our experience and help in defining new mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution.
Efforts aimed at prevention of terrorism must be focused on its causes. It is a particular responsibility of the countries from which the terrorist threats origin, but the international community should also offer necessary help. Therefore, we highly appreciate establishing of the Office of Counter-Terrorism at the initiative of the Secretary-General, which will enable a strong leadership and connection between the UN and its members in preventing conflicts and terrorism.
Montenegro unequivocally supports the efforts aimed at non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Non-Proliferation Treaty is a foundation for improvement of the global stability. Montenegro has defined its national framework by adopting the Strategy on Non-proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (2016-2020) and the Action Plan for its implementation.
Montenegro strongly condemns nuclear weapons tests conducted by North Korea as an act that violates international obligations determined by the Security Council resolutions and poses a serious threat to global peace and security. We support diplomatic efforts aimed at calming down current situation and call on North Korea to fully respect its international obligations.
Highly important multilateral agreements that have been adopted confirm that multilateralism is crucial and essential for achieving peace, inclusive sustainable growth and respect for the human rights. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and Paris Climate Agreement represent a universal platform for the transformation and progress. Therefore, for their full implementation, it is neccessary to ensure the utmost commitment of all member states and considerable financial resources.
Montenegro has strongly supported the negotiations on new international accord on climate changes. Paris Agreement on Climate Changes is a foundation for further efforts in preserving a long-term stability of the climate system. I had a pleasure and honour to participate on behalf of Montenegro in the historic summit in Paris, when this agreement was adopted and, later, to take part in its signing ceremony in the UN headquarters. In the efforts to mitigate the climate changes, Montenegro financially contributes to the Trust Fund of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes.

Respect for human rights is a precondition for peace, stability and development. Full implementation of the international standards and norms relating to promotion and protection of human rights is the obligation of each country. Being committed to the multilateral system of protection and promotion of human rights, particularly the most vulnerable groups, we attach special importance to the poverty eradication and fight against discrimination. We attach special attention to: strengthening the position and role of women in society and prevention of violence against women; child protection and development; fight against discrimination of LGBTI population and persons with disabilities. We especially appreciate the joint initiative of the European Union and the United Nations for eliminating of all forms of violence against women and girls as well as launching the Global Alliance to end trade in tools of torture and capital punishment.
I am certain that improvement of human rights protection and respect recommends Montenegro for a candidate for membership to the Human Rights Council 2022-2024. This was also confirmed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights who said that Montenegro was one of the 33 UN members that sent regular reports on the implementation of the international agreements concerning human rights.
Attaching special importance to creating key documents on refugees and migrants, we point out to the necessity of a comprehensive approach, taking into account developing, humanitarian and security dimension as well as human rights dimension. We are ready, in cooperation with the UNHCR and based on our experience, to make a concrete contribution to drafting two global compacts.
Enormous needs for offering humanitarian assistance to the civilians in conflicts and natural disasters oblige the United Nations to reinforce mechanisms for humanitarian aid. Montenegro has actively participated in the first World Humanitarian Summit last year. This Summit confirmed the necessity of an efficient coordination of the international humanitarian assistance. Therefore, Montenegro has invested significant efforts this year to ensure appropriate legislative and strategic framework for planning and implementation of control and financing of the international development cooperation and humanitarian assistance.
Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen,
Finally, allow me to extend congratulations, in my own name and on behalf of Montenegro, to Mr. Miroslav Lajak on his election as the President of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly, whose persistent commitment to dialogue and cooperation unequivocally confirms that he will be very successful in this high office.

I would also like to express high appreciation to the former President, Mr. Peter Thomson, for the achievements in his work related to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
I avail myself of this opportunity to reiterate my most sincere congratulations to the new Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres. I am convinced that his rich professional experience, leadership and commitment will contribute to the work and results of the United Nations in times of complex challenges that the world faces today. I also express my sincere gratitude to the former UN Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his overall contribution to achieving goals and values of the United Nations and his support for Montenegro.
I wish a successful 72nd session of the UN General Assembly.
Thank you for your attention."
Mozambique,"Mr. President Mr. Secretary-General Excellencies Ladies and Gentlemen
I have the honour to address the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, on behalf of His Excellency Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic of Mozambique, who could not attend this august gathering due to other commitments at home. Therefore, allow me to start by conveying President's Nyusi good wishes for a successful session of this highest forum for global political and diplomatic dialogue - the United Nations General Assembly.
I would like to seize this opportunity to join the speakers before me, in congratulating His Excellency Miroslav Lajcfik, for his unanimous election to preside over the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
I assure you, Mr. President, the full commitment of Mozambique to contribute towards the realization of the goals we all envisage for this important session. We trust that your crafted leadership and diplomatic experience will add value to our endeavours and contribute for the success of the work of this session.
I equally congratulate your predecessor, His Excellency Peter Thomson, of Fij i, for his stewardship and commitment to fulfil the agenda of last session of the General Assembly.
A special word of appreciation goes to His Excellency Antdnio Guterres, the UN SecretaryGeneral, for his vision and leadership displayed in this first year in office. We believe that he is steering our organization into the right path to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness as it serves us, member states, in our quest to deliver on the ambitious goals we have set for our peoples. Only a strong and vibrant UN system can ensure that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its goals will deliver societies that are more inclusive, peaceful and prosperous without compromising on the very existence of our planet.
Mr. President
Two years after we pledged our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, the world is confronted with multiple and complex challenges that threaten to:
"" Constrain the gains we made in fostering global peace and stability, ,/ Stall and reverse the advances made in fostering social and economic wellbeing of our
peoples; and ,,/ Cause irreversible damages to our planet.
Therefore, we welcome the theme chosen for this session by the President of the General Assembly, ""Focusing on People: Fighting for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet"" as it allows this august body to timely reflect on how best to address the challenges before
US.
This reflection at a multilateral forum like the General Assembly is essential if we are to coordinate and consolidate our approaches as we strive individually and collectively to deliver on the 2030 Agenda.

The renewed focus onpeople should serve as a universal impetus of all the development actors to translate into practice, actions that promote peace and wellbeing of the entire humanity.
It is worth recalling that our resolve is to make the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development a framework that brings together the collective will to transform people's lives in a sustainable way, by lifting them from poverty and promoting human dignity without neglecting peace as a critical factor for the attainment of sustainable development, based on the interplay of the economic, social and environmental pillars.
As we strive to accomplish these goals, we are challenged to find ways and means to honour the commitments undertaken in the Addis Ababa Agenda for Development Financing, in the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction and in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Only joint and complementary efforts in this three domains will enable us to build the necessary resilience at national, regional and international level commensurate to the challenges before us and in line with our aspiration of leaving no country behind.
Mr. President
The experiences we gained and the challenges we faced in the implementation of other globally agreed development goals in the past underline the need for a greater commitment of our development partners to scale-up and honour their assistance and for funding pledges made for climate resilience, mitigation and adaptation, as well as for disaster prevention efforts in developing countries. This support is of paramount importance to mitigate the effects of climate variability whose devastating effects have been laid bare in several member states of this august body in the last two months.
Furthermore, it also made clear that a robust and efficient UN system, as well as a steady partnership between the organization and the regional bodies can play a catalytic role in accelerating national development and strengthening democratic political systems and institutions that can lead to more inclusive and hence peaceful societies.
in this vein, we support the ongoing efforts to reform and reposition the UN development system, undertaken by the Secretary-General, in order to make it more responsive to the development needs of its member states.
Mr. President
The overwhelming challenges of our times require bold and determined political will to yield the results we seek. Mozambique reaffirms its unequivocal commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development since focusing on people has always been at the core of Mozambique's national development agenda.
Therefore, we have aligned our national development agenda to include the three dimensions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as reflected in the five pillars of the national Five Year Program namely:
"" Consolidating national unity, peace and sovereignty; "" Developing human and social capita!; "" Promoting employment, productivity and competitiveness; "" Developing economic and socia! infrastructures; and

,/"" Ensuring sustainable and transparent management of natural resources and the environment.
Mozambique has created a multi-stakeholder National Reference Group which encompasses Government, Civil Society, Private Sector, and International Cooperation Partners for the management of the SDGs, and is promoting capacity building for its implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
In the effort to consolidate national unity, peace and sovereignty, our focus on people leads us to strive to ensure that lasting peace and stability is a reality to all Mozambicans. Thus, durable peace and stability ranks as an overarching priority in our national agenda, as it is a crucial factor for the development and for the promotion of lasting human security in its broadest sense.
Therefore, the Government of Mozambique, under the leadership of President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi strives for an inclusive dialogue with all political actors and the civil society through both formal and informal mechanism, including the Parliament. This inclusive approach is also used to engage all Mozambicans in the conceptualization and implementation of the national development agenda.
In addition, our focus on people also envisages not to leave anyone behind, one of the guiding precepts of our universal agenda. Therefore, particular attention is given to policies and strategies aimed at the protection and the full enjoyment of human rights, the promotion of gender equality and equity as well as the empowerment of women and youth who constitute the majority of our people.
Mr. President
Mozambique believes that our focus on people, peace, decent life and sustainable planet also requires a regional dimension, particularly in the context of a globalized world. Hence, we are encouraged by the contributions that regional and international multilateral mechanisms have had to prevent and manage conflicts and to promote peace and stability, in particular those under Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, to which we are proud to belong to.
We believe that mechanisms that promote peace and prosperity should also constitute a strong platform of action aimed at fostering dialogue among civilizations, an unquestionable tool in the promotion of a culture of tolerance, peaceful coexistence and sustainable world. We pledge to continue to play our role in these endeavours.
Mr. President
Our resolve to focus on people entails that we address with a sense of urgency the root causes of the increase on unregulated migration and massive flows of refugees, two dimensions of the human crises that we are confronted with in modern times.
This regrettable reality is in great part a consequence of a succession of unresolved crisis or poorly settled conflict situations in relation to which the international community bears a responsibility.

In this connection, we risk achieving an ineffective and fragile peace if the international community remains focused on short term and ad hoc measures which leave scope for the recurrence of the same intractable problems at a later stage.
The international community should come together, to redouble efforts and to build consensus to prevent the senseless loss of lives. We need to adopt measures to reduce people's vulnerabilities, complemented by actions that address the complex and structural causes of these mass movements such as conflicts and political, social and economic exclusion.
Focus onpeople on a sustainable planet also requires an urgent attention to climate change. Today more than ever before the challenges posed by the adverse impact &climate change are noticeable. Every day we are confronted by the destructive impact of climate change, challenging those who continue to harbour doubts about the effects of human activities on the environment and the climate.
The recent devastating effects of the hurricanes, the mudslides and the earthquake that affected millions of people in the Caribbean region, the United States of America, Sierra Leon and Mexico are a vivid reminder of the scale of the natural disaster threats we face. 1 would like to seize this opportunity to convey to the affected people and countries, a message of solidarity and sympathy, on behalf of the people and the government of Mozambique.
The great human losses and the destruction of infrastructures as a result of the scale and ferocity of the storms prove, once again, that beyond our convictions we need to reflect and to act as a common front, to face the menaces arising from climatic change. To this end, we reaffirm the importance of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change as an instrument to strengthen the much needed partnerships for adaptation and mitigation measures.
Mr. President
The positive dynamics generated by the major development commitments made by the international community in 2015 have been overshadowed by the worrying signs of the eruption of political instability, the prevailing inter and intra-states conflicts, particularly in Afi'ica and the Middle East, the rising tensions in the Korean Peninsula, as well as by the recurrence of acts of terrorism and of violent extremism.
These challenges to peace and stability threaten to reverse the development gains registered over the recent decades and to hinder our development efforts as we chart the way forward.
Therefore, it is our hope that the ongoing peace initiatives as well as the measures to curb the recruitment and finance of terrorist groups result in opportunities to further promote peace and development, as well as to strengthen human rights and to build more inclusive societies.
Only through constructive dialogue and peaceful means and solutions we can secure durable peace and stability in our world. To this endeavour, we would like to emphasise the importance of strong democratic institutions at national level, the impacts of regional cooperation and the role of the United Nations.

Mr. President
As we gathered in this great hall, the world is once again lacing the threat of the dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons that have become the most dangerous existential threat that humanity faces in the 21 st Century.
As a country with a Constitution that values the principle of universal disarmament of all states and the negotiated solutions of international conflicts, as well as the peaceful use of nuclear energy, Mozambique notes with great concern the escalation of tension and the risk of nuclear confrontation that is unfolding in the Korean Peninsula. The catastrophic impact of a nuclear conflict demands a more restrained approach based on dialogue, skilful diplomacy and the political will to de-escalate and to fully comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions. More than anything, the resolutions signal our collective disapproval of the course of events in that part of the world.
The lack of progress in the decolonization of Western Sahara, the sole African country still to exercise the right to self-determination continues to be a cause for grave concern to Mozambique. Regrettably, all the efforts deployed by the United Nations, the African Union and other actors to bring about an accepted settlement aiming to grant the people of Western Sahara their inalienable right to self-determination and independence has not yielded results.
We would like to seize this opportunity to call upon the Security Council, the General Assembly and the international community to exercise their responsibility by implementing their own resolutions, particularly regarding the principle of self-determination and right of freedom, as well as to support the African Union and its Special Envoy to Western Sahara, Mr. Joaquim Chissano, former President of Mozambique.
The principle of self-determination and right of freedom should also be a reality for the Palestinian people. To this end, it is imperative that the relevant UN Security Council resolutions are implemented. We believe that the solution relies in the two states principle, Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side, in peace and security.
Mozambique followed with interest the efforts of Cuba and the United States of America to stabilise the diplomatic relations between these two neighbouring countries, an important step towards the normalisation of bilateral relations and to bring to an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba. In this context, we note with concern the latest developments and appeal to the United States of America to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo for it hinders the socio-economic development of Cuba and the Cuban people. Therefore, Mozambique, once again, associates itself with the overwhelming majority of countries in this hall to demand the immediate termination of this unilateral coercive measure.
Mr. President
We live in a world confronted by challenges that demand global responses. The relevance of the UN, the lodestar of multilateralism, over the last 72 years of its existence has always rested in its ability to reform and re-invent itself to respond more suitably to the challenges of continuously changing world it serves.

Therefore, Mozambique supports the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts to reform the United Nations System to make it fit for purpose, and commends his demonstrated desire to fully consult and seek consent of the UN membership at each stage of the process. In addition to the ongoing reforms, we also need to urgently accelerate the reform of the Security Council, another element that will contribute to reaffirm the role of the United Nations in the search for sustainable solutions for the peace and security challenges facing the humanity. The difficulties stemming from the lack of consensus among members to initiate text-based negotiations to complete the reform of the Security Council constrain our ability to open a new window of opportunity that would enhance the credibility of the organ by making it more representative of the current reality. The Security Council is one of the fundamental pillars for the success of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Mr. President I would like to conclude by reiterating the unconditional commitment of the Government of Mozambique to continue to engage, in partnership with the United Nations and fellow member states, in the search of sustainable solutions to the problems that affect the humanity. History has shown us that humankind thrives when ""we, the peoples"" are able to share, collaborate, cooperate, dialogue and care. The UN General Assembly will always be the platform where we come to recommit to rededicate ourselves to noble ideals on which this great organization was founded: ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". Let's all stay loyal to these lofty ideals enshrined in the UN Charter and work together to transform our world. Thank you very much!

Myanmar,"Mr President, I would like to extend our congratulations to you on your election as President
of the 72na Session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under your able leadership, this year's session will be fruitful.
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before I go into the substance of my statement, I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy to the government and people of Mexico for the loss of life and property caused by the deadly earthquake which hit Mexico City.
I also wish to convey our profound sympathy to the government and people of the United States who experienced horrendous consequences of hurricanes in a short span of two weeks. Our sympathies also go to the people of Puerto Rico who are still reeling from the effects of hurricane Maria.
The intensity and frequency of such natural disasters are evidence of climate change. Climate change is now becoming a reality posing a serious threat to our planet. The impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Myanmar is one of those countries that are highly vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change. As a country frequently affected by storms, floods and droughts, Myanmar welcomes the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I am pleased to inform this august Assembly that yesterday Myanmar deposited with Secretary-General the instruments of ratification on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol.

Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
We welcome this year's theme ""Focusing on people -- striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"". Peace and stability is something that we are striving to achieve in Myanmar after nearly seven decades of civil strife and conflict.
Last year from this podium, our State Counsellor DawAung San SuuKyi set out the government's vision to end decades of internal armed conflict in Myanmar and to find lasting and meaningful solutions to the complex situation in Rakhine State.
Today, one year on, I stand before you to apprise you of the progress we have made and the remaining challenges. Given that the situation in Rakhine State has understandably been the focus of the world's attention in recent weeks, let me start by addressing this issue.
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Yesterday, the State Counsellor briefed the Diplomatic Corps on the government's efforts regarding national reconciliation and peace. She highlighted the achievements in the past 18 months and challenges that remain. In touching upon the situation in Rakhine, she said that Myanmar shares the concern of the international community regarding displacement and suffering of all communities affected by the latest round of terrorist attacks. She also stressed that ""We condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence. We are committed to the restoration of peace, stability and rule of law throughout the State. The security forces have been instructed to adhere strictly to the Code of Conduct in carrying out security operations, to exercise all due restraint, and to take full measures to avoid collateral damage and the harming of innocent civilians. Human rights violations and all other acts that impair stability and harmony and undermine the rule of law will be addressed in accordance with strict norms of justice. We feel deeply for suffering of all the people who have been caught up in the conflict.""

Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The situation in Rakhine has been one of the top priorities of the government since it assumed office. The government has been endeavoring to restore peace and stability and to promote harmony among all communities.
The Central Committee on Implementation of Peace, Stability and Development of Rakhine State, chaired by the State Counsellor herself, was established on 30 May 2016 to address the specific needs of the State.
Additionally in August 2016, she set up a commission headed by Dr. Kofi Annan to advice the government on sustainable solutions to the complex situation in Rakhine.
We have been striving to ensure that the Rakhine State is duly developed while ensuring peace, stability and societal cohesion. This is no easy task. Deep mistrust developed over decades has to be slowly chiseled away.
On 24 August 2017, the Kofi Annan Commission released its final report. Our government immediately welcomed it.
We had hoped that today's occasion would be an opportunity for us to communicate to the world the progress that we have made towards implementing the Commission' s recommendations.
It is therefore with deep regret that instead, I must primarily address you on the current state of affairs in Rakhine State, following the recent attacks by the terrorist group known as ARSA last month.
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
As you are aware, within hours of the release of the Advisory Commission's report, a series of coordinated attacks were carried out on 30 police outposts in Northern Rakhine. The ARSA claimed responsibility for the attacks.
These attacks ignited fresh violence in the region, resulting insignificant loss of life, widespread suffering and mass displacement of all communities.

Those who have had to abandon their hearth and home are many - not just Muslim and Rakhine, but also small minority groups such as Daingnet, Mro, Thet, Mramagyi and Hindus. Most of the world has been oblivious of their existence and plight.
Let me be clear. The government of Myanmar is deeply concerned about the present situation in Rakhine. Our deepest sympathy goes to the families of all innocent civilians and members of the police and security forces who have lost their lives. There is no denying that this is a problem of significant magnitude.
I am happy to inform you that the situation has improved. No armed clashes have been reported since 5 September.
Accordingly, we are concerned by reports that the numbers of Muslims crossing into Bangladesh remain unabated.
We would need to find out the reason for this exodus. What is little known is that the great majority of the Muslim population decided to remain in their villages.
We share the need to ensure that vital humanitarian assistance is provided to all those in need.
Moreover, we acknowledge that the duty to respond to the challenges in Rakhine State is first and foremost the duty of our national government. The situation in Rakhine is complex. The challenges we face are significant. We have accordingly adopted an integrated national strategy to address this problem.
I am pleased to announce the launch of a committee chaired by the Union Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission. To ensure transparency and accountability, the Committee is mandated to publicly issue a progress report every four months. In addition to the Committee, we intend to establish an Advisory Board comprised of eminent persons from both Myanmar and abroad.
At present, humanitarian assistance is our first priority. We are committed to ensuring that aid is received by all those in need, without discrimination. We have already dedicated significant national funds and resources to humanitarian relief operations.

I am also pleased to inform you that a new government-led mechanism, established in cooperation with the Red Cross Movement, has also started its humanitarian assistance activities.
On behalf of the government of Myanmar, I would like to express my gratitude to all those countries who have offered to contribute towards this assistance programme. In particular, we are grateful for the generous offers of support that we have recently received from many of our friends across the world.
At the same time, we are working hard to enhance relations with Bangladesh. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and the National Security Advisor visited Bangladesh in January and July of this year. We were hoping for a visit from the Home Minister of Bangladesh but it had to be postponed as the Minister could not come in August. We will welcome him at any time that he is able to come and hope to take forward our cooperation on border security matters.
There has been a call for the repatriation of displaced people who have recently fled from northern Rakhine to Bangladesh. The State Counsellor in her speech yesterday stated that Myanmar was prepared to start the verification process at anytime. Our two neighbors have had the experience of such a process in 1993 through the establishment of a joint working group for implementation of repatriation process. We can develop a process based on the experience of 1993.
Mr. President Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Myanmar stands together with the rest of the world in condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. Our position is clear. We cannot condone terrorism.
At the same time, the government is working to ensure that acts of terrorism will not distract us from pursuing the long term strategy that is necessary to address the complex challenges in Rakhine State today.
The recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission provide us with a clear roadmap. Our implementation Committee began its work last week and in due course we will be inviting observers to witness some of our programmes.

Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The recent events in Rakhine State are a painful reminder that we face difficult challenges ahead on the long journey towards peace, prosperity and democracy.
However, please allow me to reiterate this: our commitment to peace remains as strong and as unwavering today as it was one year ago when our State Counsellor, DawAung San SuuKyi, first addressed you from this podium.
As part of this commitment, we have made the national reconciliation and peace process our top priority. Our vision here is clear: to achieve a democratic, federal Union, based on the principles of freedom, justice, equal rights and self-determination.
With regard to the peace process in the country, I am pleased to inform you that in May this year, we successfully held the second session of our Union Peace Conference. For the first time, we were able to discuss and define key principles that will form the basis of a federal, democratic Union. The Union Accord, consisting of thirty-seven principles covering the political, economic, social and environmental sectors was signed by representatives of the government, the parliament, the military, ethnic armed organizations and political parties.
Although we have made real progress, we know that the road ahead is long and convoluted. Our democratic transition is fragile. At this important juncture in our nation's history, we only ask that the international community continues to support our efforts to achieve peace, prosperity and democracy.
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before I conclude this statement, let me reaffirm Myanmar's faith and confidence in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
I would also like to emphasize Myanmar's firm commitment to a world in which peace and harmony prevails.
I thank you, Mr. President."
Namibia,"Mr. MiroslavLajfik, President of the 72rid Session of the UNGenera| .........  ...................
Assembly,
Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, Mr. Ant6nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Fellow Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen Mr. President, yesterday you made a profound statement in saying, ""The UN was created for people. Its job is to help people who are striving for peace and a decent life, on a sustainable planet"".
Namibia congratulates you on your election as President of the 72nd Session of this Assembly. We pledge our full support to advancing a people-centered approach to doing business in the United Nations. We also commend His Excellency Peter Thomson, for his excellent stewardship during his tenure as President of the General Assembly.
Your Excellency Secretary General, Yesterday, you stressed your commitment towards global unity and multilateralism by saying, ""We call ourselves the international community. We must act as one, because only together, as United Nations, can we fulfill the promise of the Charter and advance human dignity for all"". As the people of Namibia, we will do everything within our capabilities to support your noble cause during your tenure as Secretary General of this organization. We also congratulate Madam Amina Mohamed, a daughter of Africa, for her well-deserved appointment as Deputy Secretary General. Let us also not forget His Excellency Ban Ki Moon, for the sterling job he did during his tenure as Secretary General.
Mr. President, Development that is not driven by the people and does not translate in improved living conditions for all people is a meaningless development. Moreover, development that does not reach all people in an equitable manner will only undermine the peace and stability necessary for sustainable development. Growing income disparities, between nations and within nations, poses the greatest threat for peace within countries and globally.

..... ...... : ...... InNamibia;= we overcame the inhumanescourge of colonial oppression and .................
racial segregation. Through a deliberate policy of reconciliation, we succeeded in entrenching peace, security and stability as the pillars of our democracy. We also made significant progress in reducing absolute and relative poverty during
the past 27 years. Poverty has declined from a high of 70 percent in 1993 to 18 percent in 2015. This was in part due to the introduction of a wide range of social safety nets that cover close to 16 percent of the entire population. While income inequality has also decline during the same period, it did not decline by
the same magnitude as poverty.
We have come to realize that as long as we continue to have poverty in Namibia, even if just one percent, we can never have lasting peace and social justice. Similarly, as long as the wealth of the country is disproportionately in the hands of a few, we cannot have lasting peace and stability. It is for this reason that we have declared full-scale war against poverty and income inequality. Similarly, we have declared full-scale war against corruption, because corruption is one of the root causes of poverty and inequality.
In line with the belief that people must be at the centre of development, we have coined the phrase, ""no Namibian should feel left out"". The logic is simple, for inclusivity spells harmony and peace, whereas exclusivity spells disaster, conflict and potential war. We, therefore, commend you, Mr. President, for the choice of theme for this Session ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"".
Mr. President, In a climate of ever increasing uncertainty and unpredictability, it is incumbent on world leaders to renew faith in multilateralism. The United Nations matters most, because it is at the center of the needs and desires of humanity. Therefore, it must be inclusive by including Africa at the highest decision-making level. By failing to do this, the UN stands at risk of losing its respectability. The only sure way to restore trust in the UN will be for the Security Council to become more inclusive.

........ The people of Namibia- can testify to the importance of multilateraliSm: Namibia is a Child of International Solidarity, conceived by valiant patriots, delivered by Resolution 435 and midwifed by theUnited Nations. Today, thanks to the support of the international community, we are an independent Nation, founded upon the principles of Democracy, Unity, Stability, Peace and the Rule of Law.
Mr. President, People centered development should not only extend to a small part of the population. It must cover all demographic components. Too often, the largest demographic component in our societies, namely our mothers, sisters and daughters are excluded from development. We, in Namibia, believe that gender equity is equally important for a stable and harmonious society. In this regard, a policy decision by the ruling party to introducing a 50-50 representation at all party levels has led to a significant improvement of the representation of females, to 48 percent in Namibia's National Assembly. This is the second highest level of representation on the continent and among the top five in the world. To give further meaning to this policy directive, women have also been appointed in key positions in the Executive. These include:
 The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minster, who is also the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation;
 The Minister and Deputy Minister of Education Arts and Culture;
 The Minister and Deputy Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology;
 The Minister and Deputy Minister of Urban and Rural Development; and the Minister of Home Affairs and Immigration.

Another significant demographic component that we must not neglect is the youth. In Namibia, we value the empowerment of the youth. Many of the socalled older guard, have been groomed and well prepared in the structures of the ruling party and Government before they were assigned higher responsibilities. This practice continues with a number of deputy ministers that are youthful, while our Attorney General is one of the youngest on the continent. Very soon, the last crop of the ""Tanganyika Group"" including myself will make way for the new breed.
Mr. President, When we adopted Agenda 2030, and acceded to the 2015 Paris Agreement, we not only reaffirmed the centrality of multilateralism, but we also reaffirmed the reality of climate change. What happened in Sierra Leone, the Caribbean and some parts of the United States is a grim reminder that Climate Change is real. We witnessed the stripping away of human dignity, security and hope. We must therefore increase our resolve to address the challenges of climate change.
Mr. President, To achieve the ambitions of living on a sustainable planet, peace processes and international peace building must be strengthened. We also recognize the contribution of women in promoting global peace, both in peace negotiations and active participation in peace missions. Namibia supports efforts to increase the representation of women in peace missions around the world, especially in leadership capacities.
Out of 52 UN peacekeeping and special political missions, 26 are in Africa. Therefore, we recognize the institutional partnership between the UN Security Council and the African Union in the maintenance of international peace and security. This not only enhances cooperation between the two institutions, but also adds greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by the Security Council on Africa.

: ...... Africa should not only be seen as a source of precious primary commodities, but an important and equal partner of the international community, with a contribution to make. In this context, we welcome the recent agreement
between the Secretary General and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, to enhance coordination between the Africa Union and the United Nations.
Mr. President, Namibia stands together with the international consensus that the Israeli occupation of Palestine must end. We reiterate that statehood and independence are the national, inalienable, and legal rights of the Palestinian people. We therefore join the call for the two-state solution to be pursued with renewed vigor and determination. Similarly, the people of Western Sahara cannot continue to have their inalienable rights to self-determination and national independence denied. Namibia, therefore, reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the People of the Western Sahara to self-determination. We call upon for the urgent implementation of all Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, with the aim of holding a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara.
Mr. President, Over the past several years, Namibia has been noting the growing rapprochement between Cuba and the United States, culminating in the reopening of embassies between the two countries. We believe that this rapprochement should lead to the full lifting of economic and financial embargo against the Republic of Cuba and its people, who have the right to pursue peace and a decent life.

................ Mr. President, ................................... : ......... : .... : : ...................... : ........
Namibia is committed to supporting this organization to achieve global peace. As Albert Einstein once said, ""Peace cannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved through understanding"". Let us, therefore, try to be more tolerant by embracing diverse views through dialogue and understanding, before hastily embarking on a path of force, which will only lead to conflict and eventually
war.
The United Nations is a great social experiment which features small and large nations coexisting in peace and harmony. If the United Nations did not exist today, I would definitely call for such an organization to exist. Let us continue to treasure the unity of the United Nations, for it is only through unity, that we will bring about a world free from fear and conflict. It is only through unity, that we will bring about a world free from hunger and poverty. It is only through unity, that we will deliver a sustainable planet for our children and their children. I thank you for your kind attention!

Nauru,"Thank you, Mr. President,
It is an honor to be here for the opening of 72na session of the United Nations General Assembly. On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Foreign Minister Miroslav Laj(fik his recent assumption of the Presidency of the General Assembly. Please be assured of my delegation's full support and cooperation as you steer the work of this august body during this critical session.
I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Peter Thompson for his exceptional work as our outgoing President.
At this juncture, I would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest sorrows and condolences to our brothers and sisters who have suffered so much by the series of hurricanes, in the Caribbean and the United States, and to our brothers and sisters in Mexico for the devastating earthquakes. Your suffering and grief is shared by us all and we pray that God will be your strength and great provider during your recovery efforts.

Mr. President,
The Government of Nauru shares your view that the full implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals must be at the center of our work in the coming year. The 2030 Agenda is a universal agreement, representing our collective priorities, from the largest to the smallest nations among us. Bringing that same approach to our implementation effort is the only way to ensure that no country is left behind.
You will recall the five words that guided our work on the SDGs: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership, which I am sure gave inspiration to your theme for this new session of the General Assembly. These five words are broad enough to encompass our collectively held ideals, while accommodating our tremendous diversity. In the case of Nauru, our status as a Small Island Developing State underlies every aspect of the lives of my people.
Mr. President,
The global economic system was not created with small islands in mind. Small size and population, geographic isolation, few natural resources, and a high level of vulnerability to economic and environmental shocks are among the characteristics that make small islands a special case for development. Our people crave prosperity just the same as anyone else, however, the well tread pathways to development are simply not available to us.
More than most, our prospects depend on a stable Planet, including a safe climate and healthy oceans. That is why Nauru was among the first countries in the world to ratify the Paris Agreement, and why we have made implementation of our national contribution our top priority. Nearly every country has made this solemn commitment, and we are now two years closer to the time when we will be held to account.

With regard to climate action in developing countries, implementation is a collective responsibility. As developing countries, we have demonstrated our political will to be part of the global effort, but most of us lack the resources to fully implement our contributions alone. In this regard, we call on our friends and development partners to step up their assistance programmes. Nauru's climate priorities fall into four categories: renewable energy, land rehabilitation, water security, and infrastructure proofing, and we are looking to build genuine and durable partnerships to achieve our objectives.
While the Paris Agreement was a historic diplomatic achievement, we must remember that we remain well off track from achieving its central goal of stopping warming below 1.5 degrees. Failure would be devastating for small islands, though we should not pretend that any additional warming is safe. Negative impacts in the form of super-storms, irregular rain patterns, and heat waves are here with us now and will continue to get worse for the foreseeable future. As I said at last year's World Humanitarian Summit, all of us must face up some very difficult questions:
- How will we feed a planet of nine billion people when crop yields are projected to fall?
- How will we share declining freshwater resources as the glaciers disappear and drought in many regions becomes commonplace?
- How will we protect the millions who are rendered homeless when low-lying coastal areas are inundated?
- And can these and many other challenges be managed effectively so that we avoid breakdowns in governance and a proliferation of failed states?

It is difficult to see how we realize our vision for a Peaceful Planet without the answers.
Climate change will be the defining security challenge of the century, and we are simply not prepared for life on a hotter planet. For this reason, Nauru supports the proposal by the Pacific Small Island Developing States to appoint a UN Special Representative on Climate & Security, whose work must begin with an assessment of the United Nation's capacity to respond to climate disasters.
Mr. President,
In addition to a safe climate, the prosperity of Nauru's people depends on a healthy ocean. In this regard, we must show ambition in tackling the mounting threats to the health of our ocean. The special case of SIDS needs to be enshrined in our work in all ocean sectors and in the new implementing agreements under UNCLOS on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. Urgently launching and concluding an intergovernmental conference to draft a new implementing agreement in line with the Common Heritage of Mankind and which will allow for the protection and preservation of the Oceans, need to be a priority in this work.
Security of our Oceans is a problem which must also be tackled by us all. Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing is a great threat and economic loss to our small economy. Coupled with transnational crimes that occurs within our waters and within the waters of our neighbours, these issues require cooperation on a number of fronts through inter-agency and inter-country partnerships. I call on our friends and partners to continue existing programmes such as the shiprider agreement and other ongoing bilateral cooperation with the United States, and the maritime surveillance programmes provided by Australia and New Zealand. We look forward to partnering with other law enforcement agencies throughout the Asia-Pacific and beyond.
4

For the people of Nauru to benefit from these global efforts to protect our climate and ocean, we will need to build genuine and durable partnerships - partnerships based on mutual respect and a clear understanding of the real needs on the ground. Too often, small countries like mine are excluded from many international programs. Funding mechanisms may be effectively impossible to access because the application and reporting requirements exceed the capacity of our domestic institutions. Private investment is unreliable, and rarely available to support the provision of basic services and construction of critical infrastructure. Meanwhile, the most promising financing models for small developing countries, like direct access and direct budgetary support, are rarely offered by our development partners.
This needs to change. We need our partnerships to meet the needs of small and vulnerable countries.
We know we must become better partners ourselves, which is why my Government has emphasized the importance of capacity building as a critical component of our international cooperation. For our people to prosper, we must invest in building their knowledge and skills. There is no shortage of workshops in the Pacific. What Nauru needs is a sustained capacity building effort backed by real resources, including the long-term, in-country presence of our development partners when appropriate, so that we are left with strong domestic institutions run by a skilled domestic workforce.
The importance of a robust capacity building programme cannot be stressed enough. As a tbrmer school teacher, I am passionate about the importance of a quality education for my people. We have our own training programmes for our high school and tertiary students, and for those already in the workforce. We acknowledge the generous support of our friends and partners who provides scholarships and technical workshops which is invaluable to our

long term development, particularly in high priority areas such as the health sector, education, engineering, public administration and good governance.
Mr. President,
Having an healthy economy and a productive people also require international relations to be peaceful and stable, not only in the Pacific, but also throughout the world. Regarding the Pacific region, Nauru calls on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to dialogue with disputing countries on the Korean peninsula. The threats made against the Republic of Korea, Japan, Guam and US cities does not help the situation and it places many of our small countries in the Pacific including Nauru, potentially in the line-of-fire. This is completely unacceptable and DPRK must stop these threats including the launching of rockets into the Pacific Ocean.
Further to the south and in Taiwan, we have a state that is peaceful, prosperous and happy. Taiwan has the technical and financial capacity to contribute towards world peace and world development particularly in areas of its technical prowess and know-how. It wishes to do this and give freely through partnerships and activities of the UN system including the SDGs, the WHO, UNESCO, the UNFCCC and other UN related agencies and activities. To ensure that the Taiwanese people can make positive contributions to societies around the world, they must be given the freedom to travel to where-ever they chose. We are after all, a world that calls for inclusiveness and that no-one is left behind.
In this same spirit, Nauru renews its call for an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba.
6

Mr. President,
""People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership"" elegantly captures the scope of our work over the coming year and beyond. However, there is one other word, which begins with the letter ""P"" that we must not ignore.
That word is ""Power.""
Power will determine whether resources are mobilized for people or for profiteering. Power will determine whether the voices of the marginalized are heard. Power will determine whether we leave a healthy and bountiful planet for future generations.
To ignore the role of power in shaping our future, is to cede what little power you might have. If we are to achieve our ambitious goals for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable planet, then we will need to grapple with power as it actually exists in the world, including all of its inequities and perversities. This, no doubt, will be the most difficult aspect of the task before us.
Mr. President,
To close, I would like to thank the Governments of Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Japan, India, the Russian Federation, European Union, Italy, Israel, Cuba, Republic of Korea and the United States, for their continued support and assistance to Nauru. We value your friendship very much and we look forward to your continued cooperation and support.
God bless the Republic of Nauru, God bless the United Nations and God bless you all.
Thank you."
Nepal,"Mr. President,
I bring warm greetings from the people and Government of Nepal, the land of Lord Buddha and Mount Everest, to the delegates and best wishes for the success of this session.
I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the seventy-second session of the UN General Assembly. I pledge full support in the discharge of your important responsibilities.
I also wish to place on record our appreciation to your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thompson of Fiji, for his sterling leadership.
I warmly congratulate His Excellency Antonio Guterres, on his appointment as the Secretary General of the United Nations. With his experience, vision and versatility across a wide range of areas, we are assured of his wise leadership of the organization in this challenging time. We extend best wishes and full support to him, including on his reform efforts to make our organization fit-forpurpose.
I also commend his predecessor Ban-ki Moon for his dynamic leadership of the organization.
Mr. President, It has been almost two decades since I first addressed from this podium. In decades that followed, the world has witnessed profound transformation. While there are some notable achievements in poverty reduction, school enrollment, gender equality and combatting communicable diseases, it is not without multiple and complex challenges. The world has become more inter-dependent, and better connected. Growing interdependence and pluralism have unleashed both challenges and opportunities.
A big geopolitical transformation is in the making.
The rise of inward looking tendency in some of the nation-states marked by the tide of populism on both the left and the right have created confusion over the course of world politics.
Global community faces a more complex and polarized environment with multiple transnational challenges ranging from terrorism, climate change, energy deficiency, food insecurity, and mass migration to extremism.
1

Ethnic tensions and intra-state conflicts have taken toll on millions of innocent lives. The sufferings of people in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen have not abated. Unfortunately, our efforts have been too little, and often too late. All these challenges reinforce the role and responsibility of the United Nations.
Mr. President,
As we embark upon a path of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, such challenges are the litmus tests for our leadership. The choice of the theme for our deliberations at this Assembly ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"" provides a clear direction ahead. Path to peace and decent life for all will remain elusive without resources and commitment for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals. A very small fraction of trillions of dollars spent in armament can help the countries in need to attain these goals. Delivery on commitments, inclusive process, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities backed by adequate resources are essential to secure sustainable future and ensure that no one is left behind.
Mr. President, The vicious race for weapons of mass destruction continues to threaten the world. Nepal calls for a time-bound, general and complete disarmament. Nepal welcomes the confidence-building measures on conventional weapons, ending nearly two decades of stalemate in the UN Disarmament Commission. Nepal has signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as a step towards nuclear disarmament. Nepal deplores the continued defiance by DPRK of the repeated calls of the UN Security Council and the international community. We urge DPRK to abide by all the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. We believe this alone safeguards peace and promotes stability on the Korean Peninsula. As the host to the Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament for the Asia-Pacific, Nepal underlines the need to reactivate the regional disarmament deliberations under the Kathmandu Process. Mr. President,
2

Violent extremism and religious fundamentalism have undermined peace and security in different parts of the world - with more youths being radicalized, with more lives being devastated, societies turning intolerant.
Terrorism is a curse to humanity and biggest threat to democracy and development.
Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and anywhere in the world.
The world must come together to address not just its symptoms but the root causes. Early conclusion of the anti-terrorism global convention is the call of our time.
Mr. President,
Successful peacekeeping demands objectivity, impartiality and ability of the Mission to deliver with the consent and confidence of the host governments.
Having contributed over a hundred and thirty thousand peacekeepers in some of the most challenging theatres and true to our commitment to the success of UN peace operations, Nepal remains prepared to provide additional troops and civilians for this noble cause.
While we welcome the new standards and assessment mechanisms, a sustained partnership for capability building of peacekeepers is crucial for improving performance in peace operations. The UN should play a supportive role in capacity building of peace keeping related institutions.
Nepal has been a host to a world class peace-keeping training center- the oldest one in the region. The United Nations can make the best use of this facility and help develop it as a regional centre of excellence for peacekeeping training.
Nepal firmly believes that all troop and police contributing countries must get fair opportunities to serve in leadership positions both in the field and at the headquarters commensurate with their level and length of contribution.
Protection of civilians should be at the center of peacekeeping operations. Nepal believes the safety and security of the peacekeepers is the key to enhance their ability to deliver from the high moral ground.
On sexual exploitation and abuse, we must move from zero tolerance to zero case scenario. It is in this spirit that Nepal endorsed the Kigali Principles in its entirety, and signed the SecretaryGeneral's Voluntary Compact on the Elimination of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.
Mr. President,
All human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and should be accorded equal emphasis including the right to development.
The constitution of Nepal accommodates aspirations of all of its citizens. It guarantees a comprehensive set of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.
3

We are fully committed to the promotion and protection of those rights and their full enjoyment by our people.
The constitution establishes powerful commissions to promote and protect rights and interests specific to women, Dalits, Muslims, Madhesis, indigenous people and other disadvantaged communities.
The National Human Rights Commission, an independent constitutional body, is responsible for overall monitoring of the human rights situation and investigation into the cases of their violation.
Nepal views the right to life as the most important of all human rights. Nepal's constitution bans death penalty in all circumstances. As a party to 24 international human rights instruments, including 7 out of 9 core instruments, Nepal has been fulfilling its international obligations with all sincerity, and to the best of its ability.
Against this backdrop, Nepal has presented its candidature to the UN Human Rights Council for the term 2018-2020.
Nepal's first-ever election to the Council would be the recognition of our long commitment and contributions in the field of human rights and an encouragement to do more at national as well as global levels. We seek invaluable support of all Member States to Nepal's candidature.
Mr. President,
Migration is a mega-trend.
Ensuring safe, orderly and regular migration is the need of our time. Nepal eagerly looks forward to a successful outcome of the 2018 Global Compact on Migration.
Nepal calls for concerted efforts at the national, regional and international levels to ensure that the migration process creates a fair and win-win situation to all.
We call for safety, security, dignity and well-being of all migrant workers.
Although not a party to the Refugee Convention and its Protocol, Nepal has earnestly upheld humanitarian principles by hosting thousands of refugees
Protection of minorities and their rights makes the world more humane, and contributes to world peace and security.
Forced eviction of citizens is a grave crime against humanity. We call upon the international community to respond responsibly and act decisively for refugees' right to return to their homeland in safety and dignity and rapid rehabilitation under all circumstances.
Mr. President
The cost of natural disasters is rising sharply in terms of human tragedy and devastation. We call for greater global cooperation and coordination in prevention, mitigation and recovery.
4

The trauma of Nepal earthquake 2015 has not subsided yet. The post-disaster reconstruction is ongoing. We thank our neighbours, development partners, other friendly countries and UN family for their generous support in our reconstruction drive.
Poor and vulnerable countries disproportionately suffer from climate change despite their negligible role in greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of Paris Agreement should be done in synergy with the 2030 Agenda. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities should be at the center of its implementation.
Mr. President,
The LDCs are the most vulnerable group of countries. They cannot be perennially equated with dehumanizing conditions of poverty and under development. They must be enabled to smoothly and sustainably graduate at an early date.
LDCs and LLDCs have not been able to benefit from the process of globalization.
They need reliable and sustainable financing, partnerships, and technology transfer to overcome their structural impediments.
As cost of doing trade is higher to the LLDCs than the coastal countries, development of multimodal transport infrastructure and unhindered transit rights of landlocked nations are critical to their sustainable development.
We call for full implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action, Vienna Programme of Action and Addis Ababa Action Agenda in full synergy and coherence with the 2030 Agenda.
The development potentials of South-South cooperation in terms of trade, investment and technology must be fully exploited.
After years of political transition, Nepal now seeks to project a clear roadmap to prosperity. Aligned with economic, social and environmental pillars of the SDGs, Nepal's development priorities will be framed around the imperative of generating, sharing and sustaining broad-based prosperity.
Geographical proximity to India and China provides Nepal a rare opportunity to benefit from unprecedented economic transformation in its neighbourhood, opening up immense opportunity for trade and investment.
Mr. President,
We exercise political pluralism at home and believe in multipolarity in international relations.
The essence of Nepal's foreign policy is Panchasheel five principles of peaceful co-existence that are derived from the teachings of Lord Buddha-the enlightened son of Nepal.
These principles serve as foundations for managing harmonious relations among nations in this time of increasing uncertainty and turmoil.
5

We believe in nonalignment. In exercise of our independent foreign policy, we judge every issue on its merit without fear or favour.
We consider regional cooperation an important means for building trust and confidence among nations and making the best use of complementarities for shared prosperity.
Connectivity remains at the core of deeper integration and for creating a win-win situation.
Nepal firmly believes in the indispensability of the United Nations in multilateral affairs and global governance. All countries, particularly major powers have the responsibility to contribute to the global good by fulfilling the obligations and responsibilities.
The Security Council's reform is long overdue. Under-representation of developing countries must be addressed in recognition of their growing contributions in shaping global agenda.
Reforms must be inclusive and representative in structure, transparent and efficient in procedure, and accountable and effective in delivery.
The Secretary-General's reform proposals are a step forward. We believe a clear statement support of the Member States, such as the Declaration made earlier this week, helps make our organization fit-for-purpose.
Any repositioning of UN development agenda should address gaps, build synergy and improve the accountability, steering clear from the politicization of development under any guise.
Nepal supports the revitalization exercise of the UN General Assembly for streamlining its functions and ensuring fair gender and geographical representation at higher UN positions, among others.
Mr. President,
Before concluding, I would like to share some insights into Nepal's recent developments.
Nepal's transition to democracy from a decade long armed conflict through peaceful means demonstrates the power and promise of dialogue and negotiation over the perils of violent methods for political power. The national peace process that began in 2006 concluded with the promulgation of a democratic and inclusive constitution in 2015 through a popularly elected Constituent Assembly.
This unique peace process was home-grown and nationally-driven. Its successful conclusion has firmly established the culture of dialogue and accommodation, and could serve as a model for similar situations elsewhere. We appreciate the support and understanding provided by the international community.
Proportional representation of all sections of our society is at the core of Nepal's inclusive democracy.
Recent local level elections have firmly established women's role in politics and development. The constitution guarantees 40% women representation at the local level and one third in the federal and provincial parliaments.
6

After successful local level elections, held in 20 years, the dates have been announced for the provincial and federal parliaments in two months from now. The ongoing transitional justice process combines our international commitment and ground reality of delivering justice and sustaining peace.
To conclude, Mr. President, Let me reiterate Nepal's profound commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. The United Nations is made of big and small nations. Vast majority of UN membership comes from smaller countries, confirming the universality and legitimacy of the world body. An edifice for a peaceful, stable, rule-based and just world order cannot be erected without addressing their genuine concerns for security, development and wellbeing. We believe small nations have been sincere and serious in discharging their responsibilities as members of this body. Even with their negligible economic and security resources, they have been playing a constructive role under the aegis of the UN for promoting peace, security and cooperation under the most difficult circumstances in various parts of the world. I would like to recall the wise words of BP Koirala, the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal, who told the fifteenth Session of this august Assembly in 1960, and I quote ""Our physical strength may be negligible, but our moral strength, if we are true to ourselves and to the peoples for whom we speak, may be great."" End of quote. This statement is as relevant today as it was then. Let us collectively display wisdom, knowledge and capacity to address the pressing issues of peace, security, disarmament and sustainable development with due respect to the internationally accepted rules to ensure a safe and stable world order. I thank you all.

Netherlands,"Mr President, Mr Secretary-General, Your Excellencies, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen,
Every era, every decade has its problems, great and small. The problems we face now seem overwhelming. These days, many people worry about the future. And that's understandable. The last few years have been marked by terrorist attacks all over the world. In countries like Myanmar, Syria, the Central African Republic and Yemen, the population is suffering as a result of wars and conflicts. More and more people are fleeing their homes because of -violence, scarcity or poverty, leaving behind everything they have. Only recently, floods claimed lives in the United States and Asia, and hurricane Irma has left a trail of destruction in its wake, including in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Nuclear issues are once again a major concern, and geopolitical tensions are increasing. That is the picture today. But if you take a long-term perspective - and as a historian, I like to do that there are grounds for optimism.
This Building here in New York- UNHQ -is concrete proof that progress is possible. Here in this inviolable international zone, thousands of people from every continent work together to foster peace, justice and development, in a world governed by international law. And that's no easy task - far from it. But advances are being made. Sometimes it's three steps forward and two steps back, but if you take a long view, you can see clear progress.
Think back to when the UN was established in 1945. Europe lay in ruins, as did Asia. Two nuclear bombs had been dropped on Japan. The Cold War was round the corner, and would hold the world in its grip for decades. But the destruction caused by two world wars united the nations of the world in a shared belief that it should never happen again. Franklin D. Roosevelt put it this way in February 1945: 'The point in history at which we stand is full of promise and danger. The world will either move forward toward unity and widely shared prosperity - or it will move apart.'

The world of today is a much better world. And not just geopolitically. In 2015 we took stock of the progress we'd made on the Millennium Goals. Extreme poverty and maternal mortality had been halved, child mortality had been almost halved, 90% of children in developing countries now receive primary education. So despite all the very real problems that confront us today, i still see grounds for optimism. We can't change the world overnight, but we can improve the lives of individuals step by step. And we are doing so.
The UN plays a crucial role in these achievements. The UN is the only organisation where everyone sits at the table - and remains there. And while other institutions struggle with an increasing lack of credibility, faith in the added value of the UN remains strong among the WoTId's citizens. We must not let them down.
The Netherlands and its kingdom partners Cura(ao, Aruba and St Maarten have always attached great importance to cooperation within the UN. Our small, outward-looking kingdom could not exist without strong multilateral institutions and an effective international legal order. As a trading nation our prosperity depends on a stable world. And after the MH17 disaster, and attacks in neighbouring countries, the people of the Netherlands are increasingly aware that our domestic security depends on cooperation with other countries. It is very important to the Netherlands, and to the victims' next of kin, that justice is seen to be done for those who perished on flight MH17. It has been agreed that the next step - the prosecution and trial of those responsible -will take place in the Netherlands. To make this possible we are of course working with all the countries involved.
The problems confronting today's world - climate change, migration, food security, terrorism and cybercrime - are by definition international. No single country can tackle them in isolation. We need each other. So instead of becoming more inward-looking, as united nations we need to take a step outwards. In this turbulent world, the importance of the UN is growing every day.
Next year, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will be even more focused on the UN. In January 2018, we begin our one-year term on the Security Council, taking over from Italy. This shared arrangement is a good example of European partnership within international organisations. We'd like to see more such cooperation. Our two countries even share some of the same priorities, like tackling people-smuggling in Libya, an issue that is of great concern to Europe.

Next year, as a temporary member of the Security Council, we have set three priorities: a strong U N in a secure and sustainable world. And we will work in a transparent way to achieve this goal, each element of which is equally important.
' The first priority, a strong UN, is essential. For this, reform and modernisation are crucial. As
the new Secretary-General Ant6nio Guterres has said, 'The onus falls on the UN to prove its worth'. He has been active from Day One, working to adapt the UN to new realities. His ambitious agenda inspires confidence for the future. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports his vision and approach, and I would like to take this opportunity to call for a joint effort to implement his reform plans. It's time to follow through. And I don't only mean the Secretary-General, but all of us here in this great hall. Saying that the onus falls on the UN
-means that the onus falls on u._ss. - ................
The Kingdom of the Netherlands wants to see a more effective and efficient UN, with better cooperation between the various agencies. After all, the fields in which the UN is active human rights, peace and security, and sustainable development goals - are all inextricably linked. The Netherlands already works in this way. We call it the 3D approach: an integrated effort to tackle development, defence and diplomacy.
We would also like to.see the role of the Resident Coordinator reinforced. And the UN will have to work in a results-oriented way, adopt a more modern personnel policy and bolster its internal transparency and accountability. These are all issues which we will press for in the coming period.
Our second priority next year is of course security. The key word here is 'prevention'. We are not devoting enough attention to the early stages of conflict development. That has to change. We need an organisation equipped and ready for action at all stages of conflict. This is already happening in the MINUSMA mission in Mall, in which the Netherlands is participating, and will continue to participate in 2018. What is new is that we are using intelligence to carry out long-range reconnaissance missions. In this way we can anticipate conflict, instead of waiting for it to come our way.

We see MINUSMA as a model for future missions. For this, however, we need not only better intelligence, but also task-oriented training for UN personnel, high-grade equipment and a clear mandate. This year the Kingdom of the Netherlands is co-organising the UN Peacekeeping Conference in Vancouver. There we will press for rotation schedules to ensure timely deployment and rotation of both personnel and materiel. This will make countries more willing to participate and extend the potential life span of a mission.
Another issue on which the UN is rightly focusing more and more is counterterrorism. After all, the UN is the prime forum for global norm-setting and international cooperation in the field. When it comes to preventing terrorism, cooperation is key. A good example of such cooperation is the Global Counterterrorism Forum, which the Netherlands co-chairs, together with Morocc-o. In it, 29 countries work together to achieve a singl-e-g-oal: to keep our citizens safe. And it's producing concrete results. For instance, at least 60 countries and the LIN now contribute foreign terrorist profiles to.lnterpol. Interpol already has over 16,000 profiles. When the GCTF was set up, it had fewer than a thousand. This work is not high-profile most of it goes on behind the scenes - but it saves many lives.
Prevention of violence and conflict ties in with our third priority: sustainability. And with it, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The SDGs precede everything I have just discussed. They are the ultimate prevention agenda. They address the drivers and root causes of instability and conflict. Investing in human dignity, eradicating poverty, fostering climate resilience and promoting economic and social progress will reduce the incidence of conflict, instability and despair. Development and lasting peace - all in one package.
The Netherlands and its kingdom partners Cura(ao, Aruba and St Maarten are working together to implement the SDGs. We believe that the key to success in attaining these goals is our willingness to form partnerships at national and international level, with businesses, civil Society organisations, knowledge institutions, local authorities and youth organisations. Working together across sectors is part of our countries' tradition.
Our most important area of expertise is water management. Much of the Netherlands lies below sea level, so we have centuries of experience in water technology, urban delta management and maritime technology. Expertise that we're keen to share with the rest of the world.

Working together on water issues is more crucial than ever before. It's nearly five years since thousands of people here in New York had to flee their homes when the streets flooded in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The destruction caused by Harvey in Texas and the floods in Asia show that water issues have only become more urgent in the last five years. The impact of climate change on the water cycle is brought home to us every day, all over the world, sometimes violently. The people of St Maarten in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom are still struggling to cope with the devastation caused by Hurricane Irma.
The UN predicts that by 2050, 200 million people will have become displaced because of climate change. Water plays a key role in almost all SDGs. We learn most by working with others and by sharing knowledge. We deploy our expertise all over the world, for example in projects in Vietnam, Peru; Myanhia-r indBa-rigladesh. It's one oflhe reasons Why I'rn a .... member of the High-Level Panel on Water.
Ladies and gentlemen,
This hall, this building - all of you - represent one of the greatest achievements of mankind. All the nations working together in partnership to foster peace, justice and development in the world. This is a unique organisation, and that entails a heavy responsibility. In these turbulent times, the UN needs to prove its worth more than ever.
Adlai Stevenson, an American politician who experienced two world wars and died whenthe Cold War was at its height, once said: 'The United Nations is like a spade; it is not selfoperating. It is what we make of it, for purposes that we can find in common with our neighbours inthe world.' I couldn't agree more. We face great problems in the present age. Conflict and natural disasters affect the lives of many, and cause widespread concern. In this unstable world, the UN represents stability and a chance to shape the world for the good. So we need to make progress with the reforms proposed by Secretary-General Guterres.
Consider what we have achieved in recent decades. As they say, past results are no guarantee of future performance. But they do represent a promise for the future. Let's do all we can to make good that promise.
Toqether we make the UN a success. In the year ahead, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will commit itself fully to this endeavour.
Thankyou."
New_Zealand,"Mr President, There is no greater demonstration of the United Nations's ability to bring the world together than the opening on the General Assembly.
The breadth of issues which are discussed in this Hall is immense. Often there are as many points of view as there are Member States. But ultimately we as an Organization share the common goal of making the world more peaceful, and improving the lives of all of our peoples.
New Zealand is around a thousand kilometres away from our nearest neighbour in the Pacific, but our international connections are an intrinsic part of our identity and the foundation of our prosperity. We are an outward looking nation that relies on global stability for our trade and the safety of our people.
As a founding member of the United Nations, New Zealand has always supported the UN's leading role in a multilateral system which fosters positive international relations.
Given significant ongoing challenges to international peace and security, the UN's role in preventing and resolving conflict is as relevant now as ever.
Amongst these challenges, North Korea presents some of the most pressing threats to international security of our time.
The North Korean regime has consistently disregarded Security Council resolutions, the wishes of the international community and the well-being of its own people.
In this past month alone, it has conducted its sixth nuclear test, launched a ballistic missile over Japan, and carried out other ballistic missile tests. These provocative actions have directly undermined the nuclear non-proliferation regime, which has serious wider implications.

As we saw during our recent Security Council term, the Council works most effectively when it acts as one. New Zealand supports the strong, unified responses by the Security Council and we stand ready to work with Member States on measures that will fully reflect the consequences of North Korea's actions.
We hope to see tensions defused, and a path to dialogue developed. The goal of denuclearisation requires eventual engagement with Pyongyang. But any dialogue must be meaningful and constructive, and address the issues that most concern the international community.
Until then, we join the rest of the international community in calling on North Korea to undertake immediate actions to de-escalate tensions, improve its humanitarian situation, and abide by its international obligations.
The risks associated with nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation have been a key factor in New Zealand's long-standing commitment to international nuclear disarmament. Last week we were pleased to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The Treaty represents an important step towards a nuclear-free world.
New Zealand is committed to playing its part to address global threats to peace and security. We have a history of contributing to efforts to prevent and resolve conflict, including through the United Nations.
On the Security Council, New Zealand made determined efforts to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria. Alongside Spain, Jordan and Egypt, we managed to renew and improve cross border access arrangements.
We consistently raised concerns at the Council's failure to bring about a political solution. Unspeakable crimes continue to be committed against the civilian population and humanitarian access remains fraught.
Only a sustainable peace based on an inclusive long-term political settlement can bring this needless conflict to an end.
In Iraq, New Zealand Defence Force personnel are working to strengthen the capacity of Iraqi forces in their battle against Daesh.
We welcome the liberation of Mosul, Tal Afar and Nineveh province. This was an admirable achievement and we acknowledge the sacrifice and commitment of the Iraqi Security Forces and Government.
Unfortunately, this does not represent the end of the battle. It will be important for Iraqi forces to consolidate the gains they have made, and for the international community to support Iraq in stabilising and rebuilding areas that have been recaptured. We must prevent any resurgence in violent extremism.
We note that Daesh's influence is not limited to Iraq and Syria and that defeat of Daesh there will not spell the end of this group. New Zealand is focused on working with others in our near region, the Asia-Pacific, to ensure that groups like Daesh do not inflict suffering in the way they have elsewhere.
In addition to security-based efforts, preventing and countering violent extremism in the first place is vital and we are pleased to support international efforts in this regard.
New Zealand has been contributing to Afghanistan's stability since 2001. We remain a committed partner of Afghanistan including through NATO's Resolute Support Mission.
Ongoing support for Afghanistan from the international community is critical given the scale and complexity of the challenges ahead.
But history has demonstrated in Afghanistan that no amount of international support can, by itself, bring lasting peace and security.
Afghanistan's future lies in the hands of its government and people. We continue to call on the National Unity Government to prioritise the interests of the Afghan people above all else.
Mr President The United Nations is unique in its ability to convene the world in order to tackle problems that require collective action.
The speed with which Parties ratified the Paris Agreement has demonstrated the strength of commitment to take meaningful action on climate change.
New Zealand is among the many countries committed to the Paris Agreement.
Progressing the Paris work programme is essential to deliver a framework that will ensure the Agreement is robust, effective and credible, and that collective ambition will increase over time.
The Pacific is at the forefront of vulnerability to the effects of climate change, so we are pleased to support Fiji's Presidency of this year's climate change Conference of the Parties. It is a rare opportunity for the region to showcase its leadership in this area.
We are an island nation within a vast Pacific Ocean. Our Exclusive Economic Zone is 15 times larger than our land area.
Sustainable management of our sea and our islands are of critical importance environmentally, economically and culturally.
Small Island Developing States face unique challenges and vulnerabilities; they are also great ocean states and stewards of considerable ocean resources.
New Zealand wants to assist these states in the sustainable management of oceans to ensure that our oceans are healthy and productive. We are making substantial investments to improve sustainable fisheries management in the Pacific and to reduce illegal unreported and unregulated fishing.

We are also propelling a major increase in renewable energy generation in our region, and further afield.

New Zealand has committed NZ$230 million over the past six years to renewable energy projects in the Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and we have worked hard to catalyse even greater resources from other partners.

The tangible impacts of this work include Tuvalu, for example, which is on course to generate all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Tokelau - which was previously wholly dependent upon fossil fuels for electricity - is now effectively 100 percent renewable energy via solar generation.

Better, cleaner energy sources help Pacific Island countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and meet their renewable energy targets and low carbon development pathways. It also makes them less reliant on expensive imported diesel.

New Zealand has taken a lead role in advocating internationally for the reform of fossil fuel subsidies which lead to wasteful consumption, disadvantage renewable energy, and depress investment in energy efficiency.

We are exploring alternative sources of development financing including working with the private sector, tapping into diaspora as a source of skills and investment, maximising the value of remittances, and increasing temporary labour market access.

New Zealand is supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in a wide range of areas, both domestically and internationally, including through our
development assistance. We will continue to play our part in meeting the high level of ambition set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The Pacific is an important part of how we define ourselves internationally. There are strong Pasifika communities in New Zealand, and we have special relationships with our Realm country partners  the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau.

New Zealand works to promote a stable, prosperous Pacific region and 60 percent of our development assistance (NZ$1 billion over three years) is directed to the Pacific.

A strong and effective regional architecture, with the Pacific Islands Forum as the central regional body, is key to Pacific success.

New Zealand was pleased with the outcomes of the recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting, which had a strong focus on fisheries and climate change issues.

Pacific Leaders also agreed on the importance of fully implementing relevant Security Council Resolutions on North Korea, including by de-registering any North Korean trading or fishing vessels currently flagged on Pacific States' shipping registries.

New Zealand places significant value on the international rules based order. Widely recognised rules, buttressed by an effective United Nations, are the best guarantors of our security and our economic well-being, particularly for small states. Such guarantees are also the best means of ensuring decent treatment and decent conditions for the world's citizens  and thereby reducing conditions that can lead to unrest, conflict and misery.

But we all recognise that the United Nations can do better, and to do so must be more relevant, effective and fit for purpose.

The Secretary-General's reform agenda provides an opportunity for us to make this a reality. Important work lies ahead for us to reform the development and peace and security pillars.
The United Nations needs to invest a much greater proportion of its resources and effort in preventing conflict, rather than focusing primarily on the consequences of conflict.
New Zealand continues to support Security Council reform to make the Council more representative, as well as to improve its working methods, which was a high priority during our Council term.
Another critical element of making the United Nations more effective is management reform, including to strengthen and modernise its recruitment and management processes to ensure maximum benefit is derived from its people.
New Zealand looks forward to working together with the Secretary-General and all Member States. It is our sincere hope that reform can achieve our collective goal of better reflecting the ideals of the UN Charter and, ultimately, ensuring that the UN delivers better outcomes for our generation and those to come.
Thank you."
Nigeria,">Mr. President, Fellow Heads of State and Government,
>Mr. Secretary-General,
>Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Statement by President Muhammadu Buhari at the General Debate of the 72d Session of United Nations General Assembly, 19h September 2017.

On behalmf y ocofuntry, Nigeria, !
congratulate you Mr. President on your election and Mr. Gutteres on his first General Assembly outing as our Secretary-General. ! assure you both of my country's solidarity and cooperation. You will indeed need the cooperation of all member States as we are meeting during extra-ordinarily troubled and dangerous times. Let me also thank former Secretary-General Mr. Ban ki Moon for his service to the United Nations and wish him peaceful retirement.

Mr, President, = The previous year has witnessed many far-reaching developments. Some of the most significant events include the Iran Nuclear Deal, the Paris Climate Change Agreement
and, of grave concern, the North Korean
nuclear crisis.

Mr, President, 3. i must also commend the UN's role in
helping to settle thousands of innocent civilians caught in the conflicts in Syria, iraq
and Afghanistan. In particular, we must
collectively thank the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany under the commendable leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Governments of Italy, Greece and Turkey fo'r assisting hundreds of
thousands of refugees.

4. In an exemplary show of solidarity, the international community came together within my own region to assist the countries and communities in the Sahel and the Lake Chad regions to contain the threats posed by AI Qaida and Boko Haram.

5. We thank the Security Council for visiting the countries of the Lake Chad Basin to assess the security situation and
humanitarian needs, and for pledging
assistance to rebuild lives and livelihoods. Indeed, in Nigeria we are providing relief and humanitarian assistance to millions in 1 camps and those afflicted by terrorism, drought, floods and other natural disasters.

6. In the last year, the international community came together to focus on the need for gender equality, youth empowerment, social inclusion, and the promotion of education, creativity and innovation. The frontiers of good governance, democracy including holding free and fair elections, and enthronement of the rule of law are expanding everywhere, especially in Africa.

m Our faith in democracy remains firm and unshaken. Our regional organisation
ECOWAS came together to uphold
democratic principles in The Gambia- as we had done previously in Cote D'lvoire.

8. Through our individual national efforts, state institutions are being strengthened to promote accountability, and to combat corruption and asset recovery. These can only be achieved through the international community cooperating and providing critical assistance and material support. We shall also cooperate in addressing the growing transnational crimes such as forced labour, modern day slavery, human trafficking and
cybercrime.

Mr. President, 9. These cooperative efforts should be sustained. We must collectively devise strategies and mobilise the required
responses to stop fleeing ISIS fighters from mutating and infiltrating into the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, where there are insufficient
resources and response capacity is weak.

10. This will require strong UN cooperation
with regional organisations, such as the African Union, in conflict prevention and
management. The UN should continue to take primary leadership of the maintenance of international peace and Security by providing, in a predictable and sustainable manner, adequate funding and other enablers to regional initiatives and peacekeeping operations authorized by the Security Council.

Mr. President, 11. New conflicts should not make us lose focus on ongoing unresolved old conflicts. For example, several UN Security Council
Resolutions from 1967 on the Middle East
crisis remain unimplemented. Meanwhile, the
suffering of the Palestinian people and the
blockade of Gaza continue.

12. Additionally, we are now confronted by the desperate human rights and humanitarian situations in Yemen and most tragically in the Rakhine State of Myanmar. The Myanmar crisis is very reminiscent of what happened in Bosnia in 1995 and in Rwanda in 1994.

13. The international community cannot remain silent and not condemn the horrendous suffering caused by what, from a[I indications is a state-backed programme of brutal depopulation of the Rohingya inhabited areas in Myanmar on the bases of ethnicity and religion. We fully endorsethe call by the Secretary-General on the Government of Myanmar to order a halt to the ongoing ethnic cleansing and ensure the safe return of the displaced Rohingya to their homes in safety and dignity.

14. In all these crises, the primary victims are the people, the most vulnerable being women and children. That is why the theme of this session Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet' is most apposite.

15. While the international community grapples to resolve these conflicts, we must be mindful, and focus on the widening inequalities within societies, and the gap between the rich and the poor nations. These inequalities and gaps are part of the underlining root causes of competition for
resources, frustration and anger leading to
spiralling instability.

16. The most pressing threat to international peace and security today is the accelerated nuclear weapons development programme by North Korea. Since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, we have never come so close to the threat of nuclear war as we have now.

17. All necessary pressure and diplomatic efforts must be brought to bear on North Korea to accept peaceful resolution of the crisis. As Hiroshima and Nagasaki painfully remind us, if we fail, the catastrophic and devastating human loss and environmental degradation cannot be imagined.

Mr, President, 18. Nigeria proposes a strong UN
delegation to urgently engage the North Korean Leader. The delegation, led by the Security Council, should include members from all the regions.

r
19. The crisis in the Korean peninsuJa underscores the urgency for all member states, guided, by the spirit of enthroning a safer and more peaceful world, to ratify without delay the Treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons, which will be open for signature
here tomorrow.

Mr. President,
20. I end my remarks by reiterating Nigeria's
abiding commitment to the foundational
principles and goals of the United Nations. Since our admission as a member state in 1960, we have always participated in all efforts to bring about global peace, security and development. Nigeria will continue to support the UN in all its efforts, including the attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
I thank you."
Norway,"President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
The world has experienced unprecedented progress during the last decades. Extreme poverty has been more than halved. People live longer, child mortality rates are falling, and more girls attend school than ever before. Global political cooperation, trade, and common 'rules of the road' have brought us to where we are today.
That said, the progress we have made cannot be taken for granted. We must defend what we have achieved while working together to ensure sustainability in all we do.
I would like to highlight four crucial building blocks for a sustainable future:
1) Our core interests are common, and we can achieve more when we act together.
2) There can be no security without development, and no development without security.
The first universal roadmap for development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, is premised on this holistic perspective

3) Our security and welfare depend on our ability to uphold international law. Good global and national governance and the rule of law are decisive for sustainable development.
4) Protectionism and isolationism will reverse our common development. We need more trade and cooperation - not less. We cannot afford to shake the very foundations that our open, global economic order is based on. It is imperative that we demonstrate our shared commitment to a rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core. The WTO remains our best chance to create a level playing field. We will all benefit from open, predictable and enforceable rules and commitments for all. It is crucial that we achieve a substantial outcome at the ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires in December. That will be the litmus test.
Mr President,
As nations, our core interests are common - we all want peace, security and welfare for our citizens. We only have one planet - every nation's and every citizen's security and welfare depend on our ability to protect our natural environment and climate. We cannot allow inaction and unsustainable practices to prevail.
The good news is that the Sustainable Development Goals have given us a universal development agenda. The SDG summit that took place here in this hall two years ago was the pinnacle of global governance - and it was a defining moment for our common future. At that summit, world leaders decided to put sustainability first.

Mr President,
Preventing and addressing war, conflict and humanitarian crises is crucial for sustainability. Norway strongly supports UN Secretary-General Guterres' vision for the UN. Every tool and institution within the UN system must be realigned to improve our ability to prevent conflict and to make and sustain peace.
Respect for fundamental human rights is critical in order to build resilient, prosperous and peaceful societies. Investments in human rights today will prevent what would have been tomorrow's conflicts.
Let me draw your attention to the peace agreement between the Colombian Government and FARC. It came about as a result of the courage and hard work of the parties, supported by international partners and a united Security Council. Norway is proud to have contributed as a guarantor to the process.
The point I want to make is that the Colombian success story is propelling sustainable development both within and outside the nation's borders. The agreement struck by the parties also addresses issues of common interest globally - such as fighting illicit drug trafficking and deforestation in former conflict areas.
The Colombian process was the most inclusive peace process in history. Ensuring inclusivity in conflict resolution is both the right and the smart thing to do. Experience shows that women's participation in peace processes tends to increase the chances of sustainable peace.

Stability in the Middle East and North Africa is another issue of common interest to the international community. It is crucial to achieve regional stability, strengthened capacity to govern and increased cooperation between states in the region.
The Norwegian leadership of the donor group to Palestine - the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee - is an example of how institutional and economic development can underpin efforts to resolve a conflict politically.
Mr President,
Development assistance should play a more catalytic role in our common, global campaign for sustainable development:  by building capacity for generating domestic revenue,  by strengthening public service delivery,  by stimulating trade and job-creating investments,  and by enabling individuals to take responsibility for their own future into their own
hands.
This is why investing in education, particularly for gifts, is the most effective way of promoting sustainable development. And that is why we are working hard to promote education globally, and why Norway has doubled its aid to global education over the past four years (from 1.7 billion NOK in 2013 to 3.4 billion NOK in 2017).
Education creates stability and hope for children and young people in conflict areas. Preventing children from having gaps in their education is also important for post-conflict reconstruction and development.

That is why Norway has significantly increased its contribution to education in emergencies. 8 % of our humanitarian budget is now dedicated to education.
Norway has helped initiate the Education Cannot Wait fund. The purpose is to facilitate global funding to keep children in school during conflicts and crises. Schools must be protected from attack. That is why Norway has endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, and encourages others to do the same.
Further increases in both domestic and external financing are required in order to reach SDG 4 on quality education for all.
Last year the Education Commission, initiated and supported by Norway, delivered a report with recommendations for increasing financing for education, including funding for the Global Program for Education, Education Cannot Wait, and a new initiative - the International Finance Facility for Education (IFFEd).
Norway has doubled its support for global education through the Global Program for Education over the last four years. We are committed to working with partners to make the replenishment of the Global Program for Education a success.
Mr President,
The fight against terrorism is a core interest that is common to us all. Groups like ISIL cannot be allowed to challenge our free and open societies. Together, we are making decisive progress against ISIL in Syria and Iraq. We can now look forward to the time when ISIL is defeated territorially.

Norway is contributing significantly to the international coalition, along all lines of effort. And we are providing humanitarian relief to those affected. Norway has disbursed half a billion US dollars to the Syria crisis since 2016. This means that we are on track to fulfil the pledge we made at the London conference.
Now we must strengthen our efforts to secure sustainable peace. The Security Council must step up and take responsibility. We also need to increase our efforts in the other large-scale humanitarian crises, like Yemen, South Sudan, and Lake Chad. And we need a unified and strong Security Council in dealing with the North Korean nuclear weapons programme and the test firing of ballistic missiles. It is crucial for our common security that a political solution is found.
Mr President,
Our common commitment to sustainable development includes the commitment to leave no one behind. Norway's humanitarian assistance this year, amounting to approximately 650 million US dollars, supports this cause. Today, 142 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.This is the highest number since the end of World War II.
Many of the humanitarian crises are conflict-related. It is more important than ever to ensure the protection of civilians in these conflicts. We are very concerned about the lack of respect being shown for international humanitarian law. We underline the obligation of all parties to a conflict to protect civilians and ensure safe, unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need. Norway is working actively to strengthen respect for international humanitarian law among parties to armed conflicts.

Mr President,
Putting sustainability first means acting together to save the oceans. We applaud the UN Secretary-General for appointing the first ever Special Envoy for the Oceans. We congratulate former President of the General Assembly Mr Peter Thomson on his appointment to this important job. And we wish him every success in galvanising global efforts to protect the world's oceans.
In order to be able to harvest resources from the oceans in the future, we must ensure that the oceans are clean and healthy. And it is important that Small Island Developing States also known as 'Big Ocean States' - join forces to find good solutions that promote the health and sustainability of our oceans.
It against this backdrop that Norway hosted a meeting at the UN this week to explore the enormous scope of opportunities that sustainable oceans will provide.
In conclusion Mr President,
The United Nations is the backbone of our global order. A strong and healthy back is needed to address and resolve the challenges the world is facing today. But we know that we can do it together.
The UN provided the leadership to unite the countries of the world in the Paris agreement. This agreement is an important step towards ensuring the sustainability of our planet.

We were also able to come together in Addis Ababa in 2015 and agree on a framework for financing sustainable development. This will be crucial for our efforts to reach the Sustainable Development Goals.
Many common challenges still have to be solved. And at the same time, we must safeguard all that we have already accomplished together. These are the tasks that we have to deal with together - in this General Assembly.
Norway has actively supported the UN since it was founded. Through seven decades, and changing Norwegian governments, we have worked relentlessly in and with the UN for our common interests.
Norway is a candidate for membership in the UN Security Council for 2021 to 2022. We count on the support of the UN member states for our candidature.
Thank you"
Oman,"Mr. President,
We would like at the outset to congratulate you and your friendly country, the Slovak Republic, on your election as
nH
President of the 72 Session of the United Nations' General
Assembly.
We are confident that your vast experience and competence will enable you to steer the work of this session to a successful
conclusion.
We are also delighted to express our appreciation to your predecessor Peter Thompson of the Republic of Fiji for the commendable efforts he has exerted during his presidency of
the 71^* session of the United Nations General Assembly.
It is also our pleasure to congratulate HE Antonio Guterres on his election as Secretary General of the United Nations, wishing
him all success in his noble tasks. We would also like to assure
him of the Sultanate of Oman readiness to cooperate with him, and with all members of the United Nations, to achieve the noble goals and objectives, at the forefront of which is the maintenance of international peace and security.
Mr. President
Earlier civilizations flourished in parallel with mankind belief in divine books, which created a set of values and principles for cooperation, coexistence, knowledge and scientific exchanges. We are of the view that religious and cultural heritage, and values of civilizations do enrich and enhance the understanding of peace. Therefore, we should not overlook that heritage as an important means to disseminate the culture of peace and coexistence throughout the world.

In its foreign policy and international relations, the Sultanate of Oman adopts an approach that is based on supporting peace, coexistence, tolerance, dialogue and close cooperation with all nations and peoples. The Sultanate of Oman is also committed to the principles of right, justice, equality, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states, and the settlement of disputes through peaceful means, based on the principles of
the United Nations Charter and the rules of international law.
This, without doubt, would boost confidence building measures and mutual respect of the sovereignty of states and good neighborliness in a way that enables states maintain security, stability and prosperity. Therefore, we call upon all states to support peace efforts, and join hands to spread peace as a global culture at all levels.
Peace and dialogue have become an inevitable necessity for humankind, and their realization is a collective responsibility. The United Nations, therefore, is vested with the responsibility to work forward. However, without the support of the international community, national and international interests cannot be enhanced. Both can only be achieved when we give the United Nations the strong role it requires to protect the
world from conflicts and wars.
Political and economic conflicts represent a failure of the international system to support the least developed states. This state of affairs has created a lot of problems and conflicts, such as global migration, chaos, upheavals, troubles and instability in many parts in the world.
The economic slowdown and the drop in global trade have exasperated these problems more acutely in the developing world, which have negatively affected the consensus of states in WTO agreements. They have also limited the organization's ability to achieve its primary goals of building the capacities of

the developing states in international trade. We believe that the demands of some parties to gain larger share in the global trade or to implement isolationist and protectionist policies would aggravate problems and increase tensions in the world. We think that it is highly important that the international community look for a new vision that would achieve justice, expand common interests and help developing states reach higher levels of sustainable development.
We also believe that we can only achieve the above goals, if the member states adhere to the principles of the United Nations charters and avoid unilateral decisions and policies. We stress the importance of giving the United Nations the lead again to take the peace process forward. Its agencies should play a more active role in the development process, in order to achieve the sustainable development goals.
We call upon all states to exert more efforts to help the United Nations restore its pivotal role in international relations. We also look forward to see the UN Secretary General, who enjoys vast experience and high competence, playing a more effective role in achieving the goals and purposes of the United Nations. The Sultanate of Oman will fully support the Secretary General in his effort to reinforce the Organization's role in attaining international peace and security.
We also call upon the international community to spread the culture of dialogue and understanding to settle disputes and end tensions in the world by peaceful means, and with a spirit of responsibility and credibility. We, therefore, consider it essential for the international community to look into the causes of weakness in international policies and adopt a more effective approach to settle regional and international problems, climate change, and other issues that affect the security and stability in the world.

On this basis, the Sultanate of Oman invites the United Nations
and the International Community to take up their responsibilities and strive to achieve peace, prevent conflicts and wars and settle difference, through dialogue and peaceful means. In this respect, my country renews its readiness to work with the United Nations to build a new world of security and stability.
Mr. President
The world has been witnessing new transformations towards scientific and technological progress in a way that affects people's lives. Moreover, there has been a steady growth in population. Therefore, we stress the need to adopt a new perspective for a global partnership to benefit from advanced technology and scientific progress.
The global breakthrough that was achieved through the signing of Paris Climate change agreement is an important gain for humanity. It should be noted that several natural disasters that took place in the world should convince all states that it is in their interest to adhere to the above mentioned agreement.
Mr. President,
The Final Document of the 2010 Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons indicated that the resolution adopted by the 1995
Review and Extension Conference on the establishment of
middle East zone free from nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction remains in force, until it achieves its objectives. In this respect, my country supports the efforts of the international community towards the creation of a

binding instrument that would cover the loopholes that emerged in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This document is highly important, as it helps the international
community get rid of weapons of mass destruction.
Mr. President,
As it subscribes to goals of the United Nations, which provides for the maintenance of international peace and security, my
country denounces terrorism in all its forms and manifestations whatever its justifications might be. It also reaffirms its supports to all efforts that aim at confronting and ending this scourge through taking the appropriate measures, based on the relevant Arab, Islamic and international resolutions, treaties and agreements.
Mr. President, The world is facing real challenges. Therefore, there is a need
to adopt a unified stand to achieve the aspirations of mankind. Hence, we think that harnessing the true concept of partnership and common destiny between the members of the international community is the most appropriate means to achieve this goal. We wish all success to the works of this
session.
Thank you"
Pakistan,"Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen
Let me first congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajcak on his election as the President of the 72nd session of the General Assembly. I am confident that his long experience in public service and international relations will be an asset in successfully guiding this august Assembly to address the imposing challenges of security, development and governance that confront the world today.
Mr. President,
For over 70 years  despite the Cold War, the nuclear arms race and scores of regional conflicts  our world was able to avoid a global conflagration. This can be ascribed in large measure to the adherence by most States to the prohibition of the use or threat of use of force except under the authority of the UN Charter.
Unfortunately, the principles of the UN Charter have been progressively eroded in the new millennium. In recent years some countries have displayed a growing proclivity to resort to unilateral force and intervention against other States. Coercion and threats have emerged again as the main currency in the management of inter-state disputes and differences.
Renewed East-West tensions may engulf Europe in another Cold War. Peace and prosperity in Asia is threatened by emerging big power friction and rising tensions in South, East and West Asia.
The Middle East is wracked by war and violence  in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere. Although Daesh appears to have been weakened in Iraq and Syria, terrorist violence has spread and intensified across the Middle East and Africa and other parts of the world.
There is no end in sight to the tragedy of Palestine. Israel's prolonged occupation and expansion of illegal settlements may lead to renewed and wider violence in the Holy Land.
The legitimate struggle for self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir continues to be brutally suppressed by India's occupation forces.
Rising racism and religious hatred  manifested in xenophobia and Islamophobia  is erecting physical walls and psychological barriers between nations and peoples even as our world becomes increasingly interdependent.
The ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas is not just an affront to all norms of humanity but also challenges our collective conscience.
1

While the pillars of world order are being eroded, the imperative of international cooperation  to address poverty, disease, climate change, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and forced displacement  is intensifying.
Today, more than ever, we need the United Nations to provide the parameters, processes and platforms for global cooperation that is essential to address the wide ranging challenges to peace, security, and development.
Pakistan welcomes the efforts launched by Secretary General Antonio Guterres to revitalize the United Nations' capabilities in Peace and Security, Development and Management.
We are also committed to reform that transforms the Security Council into a more representative, democratic and accountable body rather than an expanded club of the powerful and the privileged.
Mr. President,
Pakistan celebrated the 70th anniversary of its independence last month. This month marks the 70th anniversary of Pakistan's membership of the United Nations.
Pakistan's commitment to the principles of the United Nations is evident from the long record of its constructive role in the initiatives and contributions that have shaped the decisions and discourse at this world body on decolonization, development, trade, international law, human rights, refugees, peacekeeping, security, disarmament and the United Nations' budget and management.
Pakistan has consistently been one of the world's top troop contributors to UN peacekeeping. We will remain on the frontlines of peacekeeping and continue to offer professional and well-trained personnel to the United Nations, despite our own security challenges.
Mr. President,
Our adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter flows from the declaration of our Founding Father, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah who said: ""Our foreign policy is one of friendliness and goodwill towards all nations of the world"".
Unfortunately, from day one of its creation, Pakistan has faced unremitting hostility from its eastern neighbor. India refuses to implement the unanimous resolutions of the UN Security Council, which mandate a UN supervised plebiscite to enable the people of Jammu and Kashmir to freely decide their destiny.
Instead India has deployed nearly 700,000 troops in occupied Kashmir to suppress the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiris to exercise their right to self-determination. This is the most intense foreign military occupation in recent history.
As in the past, today the Kashmiri people are waging a heroic and popular struggle to rid themselves of India's oppressive rule. They come out in the streets daily to call on India to leave Kashmir.
2

India has responded with massive and indiscriminate force to suppress the Kashmiris, shooting indiscriminately at children, women and youth. Hundreds of innocent Kashmiris have been killed or injured. Shotgun pellets have blinded and maimed thousands of Kashmiris including children. These and other brutalities clearly constitute war crimes and violate the Geneva Conventions.
Pakistan demands an international investigation into India's crimes in Kashmir. We ask that the United Nations Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights send an inquiry Commission to occupied Kashmir to verify the nature and extent of India's human rights violations, secure the punishment of those responsible and provide justice and relief to the victims.
Pakistan also urges the international community to call on India to: halt pellet gun attacks and other violence against unarmed demonstrators; stop the use of rape as an instrument of state policy; end media blackouts; rescind its draconian emergency laws; and free all Kashmiri political leaders.
Mr. President,
To divert the world's attention from its brutalities; India frequently violates the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Kashmir. Despite over 600 violations since January this year Pakistan has acted with restraint. But if India does venture across the LoC, or acts upon its doctrine of ""limited"" war against Pakistan, it will evoke a strong and matching response.
The international community must act decisively to prevent the situation from a dangerous escalation.
Mr. President,
The Kashmir dispute should be resolved justly, peacefully and expeditiously. As India is unwilling to resume the peace process with Pakistan, we call on the Security Council to fulfill its obligation to secure the implementation of its own resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir.
To this end, the UN Secretary-General should appoint a Special Envoy on Kashmir. His mandate should flow from the longstanding but unimplemented resolutions of the Security Council.
Mr. President,
Let me reiterate, Pakistan remains open to resuming a comprehensive dialogue with India to address all outstanding issues, especially Kashmir and discuss measures to maintain peace and security. This dialogue must be accompanied by an end to India's campaign of subversion and state sponsored terrorism against Pakistan, including from across our western border.
Mr. President,
Apart from the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan and its people have suffered the most from four decades of foreign intervention and civil wars in Afghanistan. These wars have
3

blighted our country with the flow of extremists and terrorists, guns and drugs as well as an influx of millions of refugees. They have set back our economic development by decades. Even today, Pakistan is host to over 3 million Afghan refugees. No one desires peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan.
From 16 years of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, it is clear that peace will not be restored by the continuing resort to military force. Neither Kabul and the Coalition, nor the Afghan Taliban, can impose a military solution on each other. The international community  as expressed in several United Nations resolutions  has concluded that peace can be restored in Afghanistan only through a negotiated settlement.
Having suffered and sacrificed so much due to our role in the global counter terrorism campaign it is especially galling for Pakistan to be blamed for the military or political stalemate in Afghanistan. We are not prepared to be anyone's scapegoat. Taliban ""safe havens"" are located not in Pakistan but in the large tracts of territory controlled by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Yes, cross border attacks do occur. These are mostly conducted by anti-Pakistan terrorists from ""safe havens"" across the border. To end all cross border attacks we ask the Afghan government and the Coalition to support and complement Pakistan's ongoing efforts to strengthen border controls and monitor all movement across it.
What Pakistan is not prepared to do is to fight the Afghan war on Pakistan's soil. Nor can we endorse any failed strategy that will prolong and intensify the suffering of the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan and other regional countries.
Pakistan believes that the urgent and realistic goals in Afghanistan should be: One, concerted action to eliminate the presence in Afghanistan of Daesh, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates including the TTP and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which was recently declared a terrorist organization by the Security Council.
Two, promote negotiations between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban  in the Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QCG) or any trilateral format  to evolve a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.
These two steps offer the most realistic prospect of restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan and our region.
Mr. President,
Pakistan's counter-terrorism credentials cannot be questioned. After 9/11 it was Pakistani efforts that enabled the decimation of Al-Qaeda. Pakistan's military campaigns have succeeded in clearing our tribal areas of almost all militant groups.
We took the war to the terrorists. We have paid a heavy price. Over 27,000 Pakistanis including 6,500 military and law enforcement personnel have been martyred by terrorists. 50,000 Pakistani nationals have been injured, including 15,000 army personnel, many of whom have lost their limbs.
4

Mr. President,
We have fought the war against terror with our own resources. Pakistan's economic losses are estimated at over $120 billion. Yet, we remain committed to fully implementing our National Action Plan against terrorism and extremism. Defeating terrorist violence is vital to realize our overriding priority of rapid economic and social development.
Mr. President,
Terrorism is now a global phenomenon, which must be addressed comprehensively. We see two major gaps in the global counter-terrorism strategy. First, the international community has failed to address the issue of state sponsored terrorism. This is an instrument of choice of the agents of chaos and aspiring hegemons. In several regions, stability will be difficult to restore unless State sponsored terrorism is condemned, prohibited and punished.
Second, to eliminate terrorism, its root causes must be addressed. These are not only poverty and ignorance; terrorism is even more an extreme response to real or perceived political and other grievances, including foreign intervention, oppression and injustice. Unless such root causes are addressed, it will be difficult to counter the twisted narrative of terrorist groups.
Mr. President,
Confronted by a hostile and increasingly militarized neighbor, Pakistan has been obliged to maintain the capability for credible deterrence. My country developed nuclear weapons only when these were introduced in our region by this neighbor. Our strategic assets are vital to deter oft-threatened aggression. They are tightly and effectively controlled, as has been widely acknowledged by experts. The world community would be well served by enabling Pakistan to join global non-proliferation arrangements, such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group on a nondiscriminatory basis.
Mr. President,
Climate change poses a new and existential threat to mankind's future. Extreme climate events are multiplying: Their consequences  flooding in Texas, landslides in Nepal and Sierra Leone, devastation in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, disappearing Himalayan glaciers  are global and indiscriminate. As one of the most vulnerable states to climate change, we believe that it is in our collective interest to pursue and realize the goals of the Paris Agreement and build a new and greener model for growth and development.
Mr. President,
Growth and development remain the primary objectives of the developing countries. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals represent the most ambitious development agenda in history. The development challenge has become more imposing due to the combined constraints of climate change, rising protectionism, fraying international cooperation and proliferation conflicts.
5

The vision of shared growth  spelt out in Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative  offers a solid path to prosperity and a model of South-South cooperation worthy of emulation. Mr. President,
Pakistan's economy has recorded a remarkable revival in the past four years. The ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will further contribute to our economic upsurge. This will expand exponentially as the Pakistan-China partnership extends beyond energy and transportation to many other sectors.
Pakistan's integration into the Eurasian Belt and Road network will provide a firm foundation for Pakistan's rapid economic development. With a youthful population of 207 million people, we are confident that an economic strategy anchored on rising incomes, consumption and production will propel Pakistan towards greater prosperity.
To achieve these priority goals for our people, Pakistan seeks to build peace within our country and security around our borders. We seek good relations with all States on the basis of sovereign equality. We will respond positively to all offers of friendship and cooperation. Mr. President,
We are poised at a critical inflection point in history. The world order that has prevented a global war for over 70 years is under threat. Yet, revolutionary advances in science and technology, the immense capacity for global investment, production, consumption and trade, especially in the developing countries, and the availability of structures and mechanisms for collective action offer an opportunity, unprecedented in human history, to address the diverse challenges that we face today. It is here, through the United Nations, that the peoples of the world can seize the opportunities to achieve our shared vision of a more just, peaceful and prosperous world.
I thank you, Mr. President!

Palau,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Let me first congratulate your Excellency, Miroslav Lajcak, for your election to lead our work in the 72st session. I would also like to thank His Excellency Peter Thompson for his exceptional service during his recently completed term.
At the outset, the People of Palau extend our deepest condolences to those who have had their lives devastated by the recent spate of hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters across Asia and the Americas. We must not forget that many do not have the resources necessary to rebuild. The international community must work harder to ensure they are not abandoned.
These record breaking storms are a harbinger of worse to come on a hotter planet. Palau and the Pacific have experienced firsthand the impact of climate extremes. For us, these super-storms are akin to ticking time bombs. No one knows when or where the next one will detonate, but we are keenly aware that it can wipe out years of progress in the span of hours.
Mr. President, your clear determination to focus future efforts on conflict prevention, peace, migration and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet is certainly timely and well attuned to the realities of our generation. In fact, your attention to these very different, yet related issues, demonstrates a clear understanding of the complex times in which we live and the need to connect the dots, the causes and the effects of the interrelated challenges that we face.
In this modern world, we must continue to expand our cooperation at every level; private, public, non-profit and political  within the context of a global network that establishes fair and transparent guidelines to guide our actions and reactions to these dynamic topics. The only body that can fill this essential void is the United Nations.
1

In the area of Sustainable Development, we recognized in 2015, with the creation of 17 Sustainable Goals, that a global, rights-based regime was necessary in the context of a global partnership if we are to successfully eradicate poverty, address universal inequalities and provide economic and social opportunities to all for the people of the world.
Through the creation of SDG 14, we recognized - finally - that Oceans are a resource of and for all the people of the World and must be protected as such. By coming together and finally agreeing to the Paris Climate Accord, we established a global commitment to begin the process of reducing green-house gasses to acceptable levels.
Yet even as we have worked to respond to these environmental global crises through joint actions, we find other issues of security and peace taking the forefront of our international conversation. As ISIS is pushed back from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fires missiles and explodes atomic and hydrogen bombs to threaten our worldwide peace and harmony. At the same time, migrants across the world are forced to flee their own countries to escape ever-increasing levels of violence.
Mr. President, these are issues that must be dealt with globally, through strong multi-national institutions and partnerships. If these partnerships are to be successful within the framework of the United Nations, the United Nations must be strengthened so that all of its members can believe in the fairness and effectiveness of the overall international negotiation and dispute resolution process. These are the issues that your global focus are aimed at -- ""a decent life for all on a sustainable planet""
Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe that we can all agree that in terms of Peace and Security, inclusive sustainable development frequently prevents conflict and sustains peace. However, peace is not always achievable, and when this is the case, the UN must facilitate efforts to respond to aggression and violence. Palau therefore supports all efforts and UN Resolutions to bring North Korea to the negotiation table. The threat to the innocent people of Guam is a threat to us and the entire region. Palau also reaffirms our support of the international efforts to eradicate terrorism organizations such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
We must also support the Secretary General's efforts to revamp the UN peace and security development and management architectures and procedures as a significant component of the overall reform of the UN organization. The Pacific Small Island Developing States face a unique set of security and development challenges. However, the UN's presence in the region is quite limited. Mr. Secretary-General, in shepherding this process, I urge you to recall the guiding principle that was so successful in delivering the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: ""Leave no country behind.""

Finally, taking into account the recent actions by North Korea, we must take seriously the longterm need to ban nuclear weapons. A good place to start is the accession to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. I must give credit to the leaders of my country, who, over 30 years ago, recognized the threat of nuclear weapons and banned the use, test and storage of nuclear weapons in Palau's Constitution. In their honor, yesterday I signed this Treaty.
Ladies and Gentlemen, if we are to find success in achieving our 17 goals in Agenda 2030, we are going to have to face the hard reality that the costs are very, very significant. Through all available partnerships, success will require the development of the necessary means of implementation in line with the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway.
In the area of Climate Change, we must continue to work to achieve the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. I would like to congratulate my colleague from the Pacific, the Honorable Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, on his imminent assumption of the Presidency at the upcoming 23rd Conference of the Parties.
To strengthen his efforts, Palau is seeking the appointment of a Special Representative to the Secretary-General on Climate & Security. The appointment of a Special Representative would significantly aid our preparation in confronting this multi-faceted challenge and augmenting UN reform proposals.
Mr. President, my country, although small, is very proud to commit itself to the achievement of our global 2030 Agenda. To help protect our oceans, we have created one of the largest protected areas in the World. Within this context, we emphasize our support for a new Implementing Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity on Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. We have also given our support to the 2016 IUCN Motion 53, promising to work towards designating and effectively implementing at least 30% of their national waters as marine protected areas by 2030. In addition, we have committed to action on addressing marine pollution in all forms.
At the recent Pacific Islands Forum, Palau also called upon other countries to join us in becoming members to the Port State Measures Agreement, an international treaty that will help stop the transfer of illegally caught fish and marine life at our ports. I would make the same request here today.
In our work to save our Oceans, we welcome the appointment of His Excellency Mr. Peter Thompson as the first Special Envoy for Oceans, which promises to bring greater attention to one of our most urgent priorities. Palau extends its congratulations to our close friend from Fiji.

These types of commitments require the strong support of a broad alliance of partners. Fortunately, my country has a long history of strong partnerships. The United States continues to support Palau in its development and movement toward economic independence. We have a shared history and over decades, have become strong friends and recognize the unique relationship that we share. In these difficult times, we support and participate in the efforts of the United States on behalf of the World Community to combat terrorism, bring closure to the hostilities in Syria, and to reduce the nuclear threat emanating from North Korea. We also thank the US for its on-going support of our efforts to establish our Marine Sanctuary. We look forward, this year, to completing our Compact of Free Association Agreement with the United States, which reflects this close and special relationship.
Palau would also like to acknowledge the great friendship that it has with Japan and the very significant economic support that we have received over the years. We continue to express our support for the expansion and reform of the Security Council and Japan's Permanent Membership on the Security Council. We wish to express our sincere thanks for the Nippon Foundation's generous support to enhance collaboration in our marine surveillance and enforcement efforts.
We would also like to recognize the very broad list of partners across the globe who make our efforts at a sustainable future possible, including the Republic of China, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Monaco, Italy, The Netherlands, the European Union, private organizations, NGO's and Civil Society, just to name a few.
Mr. President,
At the end of the day, our success will depend upon the development and maintenance of genuine and durable partnerships at every level of society. The issues that we face are becoming increasingly severe, dangerous and global in scope. They cannot be dealt with at the national or regional level.
At no time in the history of my country, or indeed, Mr. President, the history of this world, has the need for a strong global partnership of countries, organizations, and people, through a single binding Assembly of nations, been more important. The United Nations has the potential to reconcile our global issues if, and only if, its members are willing to recognize the issues and to take the actions necessary to develop and implement appropriate solutions. Mr. President  Ladies and Gentlemen... my small country, however small, is willing to act in concert with the other nations of this great body to achieve a better life for our children.
Thank You.

Papua_New_Guinea,"Your Excellency Mr Miroslav Lajcak, President of the General Assembly;
 Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations;
 Excellences and distinguished delegates.
I am honoured, on behalf of the government and people of Papua New Guinea to address the Assembly today.
Mr President,
I am pleased to convey my country's appreciation to the outgoing General Assembly President, His Excellency, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji for his outstanding Presidency this past year.
Now, as you assume your mandate, Mr President, Papua New Guinea welcomes and congratulates you and the Republic of Slovakia on your election.
I pledge Papua New Guinea's support for your Presidency under the areas of priority you have chosen.
Mr President,
I would like to also welcome and extend our best wishes for every success to His Excellency, Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations in his new, demanding and vital role.
Secretary-General, it is heartening to note your passion and drive to transform the UN.
This body must better serve the international community in an accountable, transparent, inclusive and fair manner.
For this, you have Papua New Guinea's strong support.
Let me also pay tribute to the former Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon for the outstanding work during his tenure.
Mr President,
Our world continues to be confronted by unprecedented and multiple challenges that are increasingly complex.
We are facing the serious adverse impacts of an uncertain global economy, climate change, the declining health of our marine habitats, and heightened security fears.
The challenges that we face are unlikely to be overcome, or achieved, by individual countries on their own.
I am sure that is our shared view.
We must work together to building a better, more stable and equitable world for all.
We have to do more, we must renew our faith in the promise of the Charter of the United Nations, which remains a beacon of hope for humanity.

Mr President,
Papua New Guinea recently completed our tenth national election.
Our Government would like to place on record, our profound appreciation to our development partners, including the United Nations, for the valued support provided to us for the conduct of the election.
In returning to office, our Government pledges to further increase our focus on our core polices of the past five years.
These are policies that are changing lives of our eight million men, women and children for the better.
We have introduced free education that is available right across our country, leading to a doubling the number of children in school, most of the new students being girls.
We are extending universal healthcare to our people, and this helping people to live longer and is keeping families together.
We have commenced the largest infrastructure program in our Nation's history  building more roads, ports and public buildings, including hospitals and teachers colleges.
There is a particular focus on infrastructure that promotes economic development and greater opportunity for our rural majority.
These policies underpin our commitment to sustainable economic growth and attaining our Sustainable Development Goals.
Mr President,
A nation such as Papua New Guinea can have all the best intentions, and the best plans, to continue to advancing our country  but we live in a rapidly globalising world, where events and influences are beyond national control.
Many of the challenges that confront us today are not of our making  but we bear the consequences of actions by others, and the task of addressing them!
Global economic uncertainty, depressed commodity prices and political instability all undermine growth in developing countries.
Mr President,
Papua New Guinea remains concerned at continuing threats of violence in the world today.
Be this by terrorist groups or the actions of rogue states.
We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the recent nuclear detonations and missile tests by North Korea.
These are direct threats to the lives of millions of innocent people in the United States, Japan, South Korea.

In particular we are concerned that these activities are taking place in the Pacific region.
This is in direct breach of the will of the international community, as expressed through the numerous resolutions of the Security Council.
Rather than inflamed rhetoric that could have drastic consequences, we call for peaceful resolution through political dialogue.
Mr President,
One of the greatest threats to humanity comes from within our global community of nations.
Climate Change is real, and it is taking lives and destroying communities.
It is putting the future of nations at real risk.
The recent barrage of hurricanes to impact on the Caribbean and the United States is an example of some of the extreme weather that confronts us all.
Papua New Guinea offers our condolences to the countries affected, and we call for this loss of life to be another wake-up call.
Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island nations remain highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.
This includes extreme tropical storms, severe droughts and seawater flooding in coastal communities.
The seeds of climate change we see today were laid by developed countries over past decades and centuries.
While their development was enhanced  developing countries today continue to suffer because of these actions.
The chances for development in smaller countries have been harmed by the mess created by the now powerful Nations.
In Papua New Guinea, and around the world, our people are dying as a consequence.
And living standards are being eroded and opportunity denied.
The world needs increased action now, to make further commitments to reduce emissions, and to help communities respond effectively to the climate change challenges.
We are committed to the Paris Agreement, and to the implementation of domestic policies to reduce our own emissions.
We welcome and support Fiji's COP 23 Presidency and working together for a successful meeting in Bonn.
Mr President,
Papua New Guinea is an island Nation.

The resources in our oceans and seas are tied to the very well-being, and economic development of our people.
We share growing serious concerns at the declining health of the oceans and seas that sustain so many nations.
Uncontrolled and poorly regulated human activities, including Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, pollutants and plastics, and marine debris are killing our waterways.
Global fish stocks are being decimated and ecosystems are being destroyed, and people are being forced to abandon their traditional homes because they have no jobs or food.
This is not a local problem, but it is a global problem that needs greater global action.
We do what we can at a local level.
In Papua New Guinea we have establishment an integrated National Oceans Policy, and supporting office to ensure a more coherent national approach to oceans governance.
Our commitment to SDG 14 is undiminished, and was demonstrated by our support to the Call for Action outcome document, and the voluntary commitments we pledged.
We are pleased with the historic outcome of the first-ever UN Oceans Conference, held four months ago in this Assembly to support the implementation of SDG 14.
We welcome and support the offer from Kenya and Portugal to be the next cohosts of the UN Oceans Conference.
Mr President,
Another major problem and challenge we face in the world today is the dislocation of people from their homes and communities.
We are facing a refugee crisis in the world today.
People are being pushed out of their homes because of war, natural disasters and the loss of livelihood.
This is the plight of millions of people from developing countries, who face dismal futures  if they survive at all.
The responsibility for accommodating these refugees, people who through no fault of their own, lies with the countries who's actions led to their displacement.
We live in a globalising world, but the privilege of free travel is only held by a lucky few.
They have principally been born in a developed and industrialised country.
We need a more sensible and humane approach to the mobility of people.

We only have one planet, we all share that planet, and people should be free to travel and settle when their homes have been taken away from them. We talk about greater freedoms for the people of the world. We talk about freedom of speech, democracy, transparency, good governance and human rights. But talk is easy. All too often the concept of human rights is just the theme of convenience. We need to make the process of migration less complicated and more humane. UN REFORM Mr. President, Papua New Guinea fully supports reform at the UN. The United Nations must be fit-for-purpose. It must be contemporary with the environment in a rapidly changing world. There is broad agreement on the importance of UN reform, but the main challenge that remains is how to go about it, and how to actually deliver it! We are heartened by the Secretary-General's passion, decisiveness and swift action on this agenda, including the need for ensuring gender parity in the top levels of the UN Secretariat. He has our undivided support. In respect of the Security Council reform process, this must advance the core interests of the vast majority of UN Member States. This is to make it more broadly representative, transparent, accountable, effective and efficient  given its critical mandate. The Security Council needs to be more effective in its response to present global challenges and circumstances. In conclusion, Mr President, The opportunities before the global community are great, but they are also extremely challenging  particularly for developing economies such as Papua New Guinea. But regardless of where we come from  we must do more. All nations, large or small, rich or poor, weak or strong, must strengthen our resolve and work together. I thank all members for the achievements that we continue to make through the United Nations and I pledge Papua New Guinea will work with you to achieve much more. Thank you Mr President."
Paraguay,"Mister President, On behalf of the people and the Government of Paraguay, I present our endeavors for the contribution of your distinguished Presidency to the success of this General Assembly and to the realization of the purposes of the United Nations. After turning four years leading the Government of the Republic of Paraguay, I have the honor to address this august Assembly, with a reinvigorated spirit to contribute to the making of a world order where justice, peace and solidarity among nations are the guiding principles, and where human rights, institutions and the Rule of Law are effective. We must persist in our efforts to find a reasonable balance among the interests of all States. And build an equitable and democratic world order, by developing relations among sovereign, independent States, based on respect, trust and peaceful coexistence, in which the same opportunities can be given and encouraged amongst all nations. In order for this to happen, we need the Organs of the United Nations to work properly; in special, the General Assembly and the Security Council. We aim for a more democratic, transparent, inclusive and representative Security Council, that corresponds to the diversity of the Members of the United Nations as well as to current geopolitical realities in the world. This Organization remains the most important universal forum to address global challenges. Problems such as poverty and inequality, climate change, transnational organized crime, drug trafficking corroding democratic institutions, terrorism, among others, require to be collectively tackled. We urge all actors involved to converge our efforts and resources to address these common and pressing challenges confronting humanity. The Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its firm commitment with the implementation of the provisions of the Paris Agreement and encourages other States, and in particular those States with greater responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions, to take all necessary measures to preserve our planet from the consequences of global warming. In Paraguay we have a social responsibility perspective, by fostering greater production of clean and renewable energy. We have two magnificent hydroelectric dams, Itaip, shared with Brazil, and Yacyret, shared with Argentina. This year, Itaip Binacional joined UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves, with the inclusion of the Upper Paran Atlantic Forest in the list of biosphere reserves.
Mister President, I conclude my term as President of the Republic in August 2018. This is my last speech before this plenary. I would like to single out some aspects that have improved ever since I took office in 2013. There is a fully representative democracy in Paraguay today, where division of powers is genuine, where electoral processes are unquestionable and the Rule of Law is fully into force. We have sent clear signals to the international community of our improvement as a foreign direct investment destination country, as well as for cooperation and for agreements, both, at the State and private levels. In terms of foreign relations and the role of Paraguay at the global level, we have exponentially grown our interactions through visits and invitations and through our participation in International Organizations. In the last four years, our country received the official visits of His Holiness, Pope Francis, of the former SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, of His Holiness, the Patriarch Kirill of the Orthodox Church of Moscow and All Russia, as well as of a number of Heads of State, high authorities of multilateral organizations and international personalities, who have honored us with their visits. Paraguay was unanimously admitted into the Development Center of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We welcome this admission in the understanding that it is an acknowledgement, granted by this globally prestigious Organization, to the efforts and achievements of our Government in its policies of good practices and institutional strengthening. Paraguay, within a selected group of countries that have joined the Organization, is a proud OECD member, which reaffirms the confidence of the international community in our Government's implementation of important reforms.
1

A current member of the Advisory Committee on Enforcement of the World Intellectual Property Organization, and despite years of concern for lack intellectual property rights protection in the country in the past, we have decided to hold more positions at the international level and get more involved in debates and decision making processes that could lead to a wider global influence. Paraguay's global insertion today transcends borders and continents. Our priorities, in the United Nations framework, are established in the Vienna Program of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries 2014  2024, an integral part of the Agenda 2030; for this reason, we call upon States, and in particular, our trading partners and transit countries, to take them appropriately into account. Regional integration has undeniable benefits, and even more when it unfolds seeking to reconcile the interests of all the parties. This is how we work in Mercosur in order to revitalize economic and trade integration, while moving forward the social, labor, scientific and cultural dimensions of the bloc, which represents the positive agenda of this process.
Mister President, The Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development constitutes the most ambitious intergovernmental work in the field of development ever achieved at the multilateral level. We are building an innovative and inclusive institutional architecture, participative and committed to those goals and their targets, for the accurate implementation of our National Development Plan 2030. I am proud to mention that I have signed in a public ceremony, together with the President of Congress and the President of the Supreme Court of Justice an Inter-Branch Joint Declaration, that recognized the commitment of the Paraguayan Government, in its entirety, with the terms proposed in the Agenda 2030, as well as with every one of its Goals and Targets. The Paraguayan Government has endorsed the Agenda 2030 by its three branches of Government, in what it is considered an unprecedented initiative in the region. Over the last four years, the administration that I lead has answered to the demands of all sectors of society, following the criteria of justice and efficiency. At the beginning of my Government in August 2013, we established three national policies to promote: poverty reduction with social development; inclusive economic growth and positioning Paraguay in the world. In the implementation of these three core policies, we turned a backward looking culture of political patronage and ill practices, into a model governed by transparency and formality, where public access to information is guaranteed and where greater opportunities are made available to our people. Access to public information has rendered unprecedented progress and the political will of making what is public available to the public is now materialized in recent instruments. We can affirm our country is undergoing a transformational process never seen before. And even though it generates concerns, reactions and resistance from those who were more comfortable with the previous model, I am sure that this transformation is closing the doors for ill policies, like corruption for instance, that has long time delayed our country's economic and social development.
Mister President, Regardless of regional economic problems, we have managed to achieve sustainable economic growth, and we would like to continue forging new partnerships with the world, on the basis of our reliability and predictability. In the last years, economic growth has been steady in Paraguay, with a 5.2 per cent annual average; one of the highest in South America. In the same way, we are reducing poverty rates; yet, due to long years of negligence, we continue facing important challenges to fully eradicate it.
2

Our priorities had been focused on strongly promoting social investment, in particular on education, in order to enable people in situation of poverty to benefit from economic growth and to achieve inequality reduction. We are implementing social protection programs that are emblematic, such as Tekopor, with a conditional cash transfers component; the School feeding program; Grants for elderly people in situation of poverty; and the Poverty reduction program, ""Sembrando Oportunidades"" (Spreading Opportunities). We have also increased scholarships and financial aid to young people in situation of poverty, in our conviction that educating and preparing young people academically and professionally is the best investment for the future of our country. After 175 years, the Paraguayan Government resumed its postgraduate scholarship program to study abroad, at the best universities in the world, and with a record investment of 42 million American dollars. Over a thousand Paraguayans from the 17 departments of the country and the Capital are pursuing postgraduate studies in 50 of the 200 most prestigious universities in the world, under the ""Carlos Antonio Lopez"" scholarship program. Hundreds of them are teachers and 60 per cent are women under 30 years old. The first 60 awardees have successfully completed their studies and returned home, where they are contributing their knowledge to the development and well-being of our country. Another National Strategic goal for poverty reduction consists on housing programs, aimed at providing decent housing for our citizens, while reactivating the economy and creating jobs. During these four years, we worked hard, with transparency and responsibility, and we have achieved unparalleled results in our country. For the first time in the history of Paraguay, a single administration, at the end of its mandate, would deliver over 30 thousands social households in the country, which represents about ten times more than what any other administration have ever granted. This achievement is even more valuable because it benefits thousands of families for years ignored by previous governments and that have now a decent roof and access to better conditions to move forward. We are building hope and opportunities for those Paraguayan families from the poorest communities in our country, from the poverty belts of our big cities, to indigenous communities and rural settlements, to be able to move forward. We are transforming our country with transparency and efficiency in our work, in order to take the highest advantage of our resources, reducing expenditures, eliminating project-related corruption and improving construction quality through strict controls. Our Government encourages productive development through responsible investments. We assign priority to infrastructure projects to improve connectivity, not only nationally, but also with our neighboring countries. Investment in infrastructure projects is notably the highest in decades and road works outstands for their length and modernity. We demand responsibility and commitment from our authorities and we have worked hard to achieve further welfare in the country. Thanks to this new model of Government works, we are achieving a more efficient, progressive and decent country.
Mister President, The Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its commitment with international peace and security; with the use of peaceful means for dispute settlement and with reciprocal cooperation among States. In Paraguay, a constitutional provision bans mass destruction weapons. Consequently, our country commends the recent adoption of the Treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons; reaffirms its conviction that nuclear disarmament ought to be a transparent and irreversible process, with efficient verification mechanisms within a universal and legally binding framework. Paraguay reiterates its condemnation to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear test, clearly defying and contravening its international obligations, which constitutes a new provocation to the International Community. We expect from this General Assembly a firm rejection to this irrational attitude that threatens peace and security at a global level.
3

The Republic of Paraguay expresses its deep concern for the scourge of terrorism; which we condemn in all its forms and manifestations. We reaffirm that the counter terrorism efforts must be carried out within unwavering respect for international law provisions and a strong cooperation framework among States. We will continue to cooperate with peacekeeping operations, under the auspices of the United Nations, in the conviction that they constitute one of the means to attain the principles and purposes established in the Charter. My country currently contributes military personnel, women and men, to six peacekeeping operations and invests in the training of its contingents at the Training Center for Peacekeeping Operations, Cecopaz  Paraguay. The Republic of Paraguay, Member of the Human Rights Council, reaffirms also its commitment with the effective promotion and protection of human rights in any place of the world. We firmly believe that all persons, without discrimination, ought to be protected in their dignity and in their rights. We advocate for the Human Rights Council to continue fulfilling its obligations with objectivity, impartiality and universality. In this context, I cannot avoid referring to a matter of concern in my region: the situation of Venezuela requires our urgent attention. I reiterate my message of solidarity to the people of Venezuela, to the victims of political persecution and human rights violations, in the hope that this fraternal people will be able to find, sovereignly and as soon as possible, a peaceful solution for the democratic breakdown and the acute crisis that is currently facing.
Mister President, Through international cooperation, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has for long-time been committed with the cooperation programs related to the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals; lending support to a number of countries, including Paraguay. Taiwan has relevant experiences and knowledge and has contributed to the International Community efficiently. The Government of the Republic of Paraguay, once again, calls upon Member States of this organization to identify appropriate ways to facilitate Taiwan's participation in mechanisms, meetings and activities of the United Nations System, in order to allow its 23 million inhabitants to normally exercise their responsibilities as global citizens and to make efforts to for the establishment of sustainable partnerships with all countries.
Mister President, We are firmly convinced that the Secretary-General, Mr. Antnio Guterres, has begun a transcendent and very auspicious work leading the United Nations Organization, backed up by his extensive experience as a notable statesman. It will depend on the distinguished Heads of State of Member countries that this period of sessions becomes the starting point for a new era of real universalization of the principles that regulate the works of this Organization. And, in special, for its programs and actions to be able to reduce the large inequalities that still remain among countries and regions. We must get the Organization closer to the people, to whom we owe ourselves. I reaffirm that my country will continue to grant high priority to its participation in the debates of the United Nations, convinced that its work is essential for the construction of a more peaceful, inclusive and just world. On our end, we will continue working decisively towards development with genuine social inclusion, enabling conditions for prosperity and always putting people in the first place. I will conclude with an appeal of His Holiness, Pope Francis, ""We shall never forget that true power is service"".
Thank you very much.

Philippines,"Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called children of GOD. Matthew 5:9
Mr. President, Excellencies, The path to peace must be walked with patience. To achieve any purpose with others--be they powers or people, patience is needed. The opposite of patience is impatience--the cause and aggravation of conflict. Someone said that ""Talk, talk is better than war, war."" Listening is even better than talking. We must listen to others more than we listen to ourselves. Hopefully we know what we are talking about. But others may know what we do not. We can learn only if we stop talking, and listen. We may think we know how others can do things better than they've done it. Maybe our way is more efficient. But the time

gained by that efficiency will be time lost convincing others that our way is better, rather than a compromise between our way and theirs.
Real change in the world order necessitates cooperation. Nothing affecting others can be undertaken without their willing involvement, without getting their agreement on the purpose and manner of it. Achieving a shared purpose beyond any single one's ability requires cooperation.
But how else can we get cooperation if not with the patience to explain why it is needed--and the equal patience to listen.
This is why we have the United Nations, the largest cooperative endeavor in human history. We use the UN to speak out but equally also to listen. And somehow arrive at a consensus, or at least a modus vivendi on how to proceed--in peace and therefore with a greater prospect of progress.
The theme for this year's session-- ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet""-- captures a promise that everyone who has stood here vowed to fulfill for his people, and the rest of the peoples of the United Nations, as the Preamble of the Charter puts it.
Yet, after 72 years, while much has been achieved, much more has to be done. The promise is still very much a work in progress.
We, the peoples of the United Nations, battle new threats that undermine such success as we've achieved, and frustrate further

progress in peace, development and human rights-- the three pillars of the United Nations.
Your theme, Mr. President, mirrors the Philippines own peoplecentered agenda as articulated by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.
President Duterte and The Filipino People are committed to real change, to finally carrying out long needed reforms, to addressing national threats long ignored, protecting the human rights of all Filipinos, while doing our part in attaining regional peace and stability.
We remain true to our obligations under the international treaties we have ratified. We have made much sacrifices and continue to be willing to make sacrifices.
The Philippines integrates the human rights agenda in its development initiatives for the purpose of protecting everyone, especially the most vulnerable, from lawlessness, violence, and anarchy; particularly families, women and children, the poor, indigenous people, migrant workers, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.
This is why we have a massive campaign to restore the rule of law by fighting corruption, crime and illegal drugs. We owe it to the 10 million Filipinos working overseas to keep their children and family safe. We owe this to the all Filipino Families.

The very principle of The Responsibility to Protect must encompass first and foremost the vast majority of peaceful lawabiding people who must be protected from those who are not. It is for their safety and sustenance that states exist, and for which governments and leaders are responsible.
President Duterte said fewest words and made least promises in the campaign because he listened. He listened and he heard what none of the other candidates would listen to. The vast majority of Filipinos felt vulnerable in their lives and livelihoods, unsafe in the rising drug-driven criminality that threatened those least able to protect themselves. They were also those past governments had least protected: poor and ordinary folk.
The Philippines comprehensive campaign against illegal drugs is necessary instrument to preserve and protect the human rights of all Filipinos, and never an instrument to violate any individual's or group's human rights.
War vs. Illegal Drugs
It was noted in this hall, that ""all sovereign nations must uphold two core sovereign obligations: to respect the interests of their own people and the sovereignty of other nations."" This is true as much in bi-lateral relations between sovereign countries, as when they combine multilaterally on some common decision or action. The Philippines is a sovereign country. Indeed, it was the first subject nation to win its independence however short-lived, thereby earning the honor of being the First Republic in Asia. It expects that sovereignty to be respected, and that its

democratically-elected government's assessment of threats and how to go about addressing them shall be accorded preeminence among nations--or at least the benefit of their doubt.
We prize sovereignty in all its aspects. We acknowledge the wisdom, and borrow the words here spoken: ""All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens first."" In keeping with that obligation, it is a state's duty to protect human life, human dignity, and human rights--from aggression by other states, terrorism from non-state actors, and the destruction of societies and families from criminal networks trafficking in drugs, people and arms.
As a responsible leader, the Philippine president launched a vigorous campaign against the illegal drug trade to save lives, preserve families, protect communities and stop the country's slide into a narco-state. An epidemic that would spell the end of sovereignty in any meaningful sense.
As of August 2017, the drug trade had penetrated atleast 24,848 barangays. This is 59% of the total of 42,036 of the smallest government units spanning our archipelago, the ones directly in touch with our people. Where is sovereignty in a country where vast numbers are addicted to drugs and enslaved to their suppliers?
To be sure, drug addiction calls for cure and not chastisement. When the President showed his fierce determination to end the drug menace, 1.3 million drug users turned themselves in. But the neglect of the drug problem by previous governments has left the

current one hard pressed to rehabilitate them all. We are thankful that generous souls at home and abroad are building centers all around the country.
While drug addiction calls for rehabilitation, drug trafficking surely calls for stern measures--though always consistent with the rule of law. The President has and will always have zero-tolerance for abusive cops, as time will show.
But accusation before investigation is not proof. Nor is it fair. Abuses have occurred and mistakes have been made, tragic ones for sure. While one abuse is one too many, still the abuses are far less than the imaginary numbers of partisan accusers and publicity seekers. The drug trade has penetrated even law enforcement. And yet we are getting a message that the best way to stop abuses in the antidrug campaign is to stop the campaign and live with drugs instead.
But we cannot live with drugs because drugs will not let us live. We can no more live with drugs than with terrorism, which, the United Nations admits, and as we have discovered is funded by the drug trade. This has created the new phenomenon of criminal insurgency.
In the century before last, a huge and well-populated Asian country was enslaved by a maritime power which flooded it with drugs.
We welcome this opportunity to address the international community's concerns and correct the perceptions gleaned from

media reports that deny the real scale of the problem as if denial is a solution. The problem is huge and we will not reduce it in our imagination because we dare not face it in reality.
Appeasement emboldens evil. We counsel patience but delay will make the problem bigger until it is beyond containment and control. Indeed, as we have heard in this hall, ""When decent people and nations become bystanders, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength."" We will not slide down the slope of complacency, and of willful ignorance of the threat to our country and our people posed by the drug trade.
Counterterrorism and Violent Extremism
In the past four years, we have seen the rise of the Islamic State and how it has been able to spread its nihilistic ideology beyond Iraq and Syria to become a serious threat to the world.
We should hold no illusion that the threat posed by the Islamic State will be over with the collapse of its self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq and very soon in Syria. Rather, we should all be ready to confront a very potent threat that has spread to other parts of the world.
In the Philippines, we have discovered the intimate and symbiotic relationship between terrorism vis--vis poverty and the illegal drug trade. These terrorists were somehow able to bring together an assortment of extremists, criminals, mercenaries and foreign fighters who attempted but failed to take control of Marawi. This

was part of their grand plan to establish in Southeast Asia an extension of their shattered caliphate in the Middle East.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines shall regain full control of Marawi from Islamic State-inspired terrorists. Their protracted hold on their last several square meters of the city is largely a result of superior arms illegally obtained, and the presence of civilian hostages used by them as human shields. There is also the government's forbearance to unleash greater force so as to avoid collateral loss of life. The fight has been terrible but the effort has been patient and done with care to spare the innocent. There's been less talk and more listening to those with the most at stake in the struggle: the people of Marawi. The disturbance will be over soon and the rebuilding of Marawi will begin shortly.
Terrorism is a global problem that no country can tackle alone; although here at the UN it was noted with some admiration that Filipino families outside the conflict zone quickly absorbed most of the 200,000 displaced civilians. Our main disaster preparedness is compassion. The Filipino family system is strong and cooperation is a Philippine tradition: help from fellow Filipinos is always at hand. While the main burden is borne by our government and people, and all the risks are taken by our soldiers, we are thankful for such assistance as the international community has extended. Thank you are dear friends for helping when we needed it most.
The Philippines welcomes the creation of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office to bring into a cohesive whole the work on counterterrorism by Member States and the UN. It will be a

sharing of experiences and sober reflections rather than of blind anxieties. That way lies real results.
Rule of Law
As a founding member of the UN, the Philippines has been a strong advocate of the rule of law. We uphold the core of the UN mission - to draw upon the strength and sovereign equality of its members to achieve their common goals.
Mr. President,
Centuries ago, the ambition for land to take invited long and terrible wars. The battle has shifted to the seas, hence the need to affirm our commitment to UNCLOS, as the international law governing the rights and responsibilities of States Parties in their use of the world's oceans.
The issues are numerous, intertwined and complex. Territorial claims, Sovereignty rights, security and protection of marine life and resources, to name a few.
Dialogue, building trust and promoting cooperation to address issues of concern is the way forward in addressing maritime disputes.
The Philippines, as ASEAN Chairman this year, looks forward to commencing negotiations on the long-overdue code of conduct in West Philippine Sea/South China Sea. We thank the individual

ASEAN states and China for their utmost cooperation in this endeavor.
Again in this work, patience, a lot of listening, and willingness to work with rather than against each other, is essential.
We live in a global community and we are all citizens of the world. Today, our social contract is no longer confined to the nation state. In our region, we exert efforts to build bridges and not walls, to emphasize commonalities and not differences, to think less that we are Filipinos, Thai, Indonesian, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese and think more of ourselves as Asians. Beyond being Asians we are global citizens, the people of the United Nations.
HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW
Human rights and the dignity of every person is the main pillar of the United Nations. So it is for the Philippines. As a very spiritual people we are united in believing that man was created in GOD's image. That there can be no compromise on human rightsof those who break the law and surely, too, of those who are their victims. We also believe in accountability, not least in the practical conviction that as we sow so shall we reap.
We should never tolerate human rights abuses but neither should we tolerate misinformation, fake news on and politicization of human rights, for these undermine our collective efforts as the United Nations to uphold the universality of human rights and dignity of human life.

But why debate security versus human rights? Security and human rights are not incompatible. Indeed, the first is our duty to the other. Without security, the most basic human rights, to life and safety, are constantly under attack--from terrorism, criminality, drug and human trafficking.
PEACE AND SECURITY
Much has been said about ASEAN. Words like cooperation, consultation and consensus are identified with it. Critics have remarked on the slowness of ASEAN's way of proceeding. Yet slow as ASEAN's progress has been, that progress has been solid, substantive and irreversible--precisely because of the patience with which it was made; thereby proving that consensusbased organizations work better.
Five decades ago, Southeast Asia was marred by conflicts, and all previous attempts at Southeast Asian regionalism proved extremely difficult. Our different cultures and differing ideologies and political systems only reinforced this pessimistic outlook.
Fifty years hence, the ASEAN miracle prevails with greater political and economic prospects that have gripped global interest. ASEAN has overcome the divisions, fears, and hostilities of the past. We have used regional cooperation to promote growth, development and integration and peaceful settlement of disputes.

Today, the Philippines patiently builds stronger relationships with the international community through the ASEAN and the United Nations. We remain a friend to all and an enemy to none--to bridge, to build, a more peaceful, secure and stable world.
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
There is no development without peace, and no peace without development. This is what the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides. It serves as the template of the Philippine Development Plan called Ambisyon Natin 2040 or Our Ambition 2040.
While the Philippines has experienced unprecedented economic growth, we are adopting measures to make growth more inclusive by massive poverty alleviation programs, creating more jobs, driving innovation, making quality education universally available. Relevant education that imparts training and skill building to make people resilient in changing markets, building greater trust in government with the hope for result of raising tens of millions of Filipinos from poverty.
There is a link between increasing poverty, corruption and a deteriorating environment. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte seeks to reverse this linkage by addressing the adverse effects of climate change  to which the Philippines is most vulnerable  through disaster risk reduction and through strict implementation of laws protecting the environment.

To honor the immense sacrifices of our 10 Million Filipinos abroad  and all other migrant workers of the world making huge sacrifices so that their families may have a better life  we press on with our advocacy of the Global Compact on Migration. As we seek to improve conditions for foreign nationals living and working in the Philippines, we advocate the fundamental concept of loving our neighbor as we love ourselves. We call on the UN to elevate migration in its agenda.
Disarmament and Non-Proliferation
If we listen to each other, we will hear the same thing. We have no need for nuclear weapons. There is absolutely no benefit in another cold war, neither in an arms race. We want nuclear weapons to be a thing of the past and we do not want an arms race anywhere in the world.
On July 7, the Philippines joined 121 other member-states in securing our world from weapons of mass destruction by adopting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Three days ago, I signed the Treaty. The Philippines calls on Member States with nuclear weapons to likewise sign on. We can only have a safe world if we get rid of all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. By doing so, we ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind.""
The Philippines, on its own, and as this year's chair of ASEAN, has expressed its grave concern over the growing tensions in the Korean Peninsula because of the Democratic People's Republic

of Korea's missile test launches and detonations. The Philippines joins the call on the DPRK to put a stop to its provocations, which bring us closer to an unimaginable scenario: a war to end all wars because no one will be left to fight new ones.
CONCLUSION
Let me end where I began and call again for patience, for listening and for cooperation, focused always on the wellbeing of, to quote the Charter's preamble, ""We, the peoples of the United Nations.""
Let us listen to each other as we are the people of the United Nations. Our Faith and destiny as human beings of this planet are intertwined.
In a situation like the present, where every finger in and around the Korean Peninsula is on a trigger, every eye is out for a wrong move, the likelihood of a surprise attack is virtually zero. In that situation, no one can be caught by surprise and unprepared to strike back. So what is there to lose by going on talking and listening until the very last moment?
Patience, listening as much as talking, cooperation among friends and even enemies: these are the signposts on the path of peace.
Peace is about peoples. No people and no country can have a national identity if there are no others who can tell the difference.

Without peoples--each one different yet all the same in their being and in the good they seek--it is impossible to imagine the world. To utter the phrase ""the world"" means a planet with many peoples sharing it.
All of us are pieces of a giant puzzle. We seek to be completed by being pieced together thereby creating a whole, beautiful picture. In a war of all against all, of everyone each against the other, the last man standing is not at peace he is but a single piece. He is not the victor he is simply alone.
Thank you Mr. President."
Poland,"Excellencies,
Distinguished Delegates, I wish to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajak, the Chairman of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, on his election to this honourable function. I wish to assure you, Sir, about my country's full support for the measures you will take. At the same time, I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Peter Thomson for his active chairmanship over the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly.
Ladies and Gentlemen! The basic goals pursued by the international community, and by the same token, the foundations of the United Nations system, are SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, ENSURING PEACE AND SECURITY as well as PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. I was therefore truly satisfied to learn that the guiding motto of this year's session is the focus on human needs. Too often in global politics have we devoted too much time and attention to big models and economic or social systems, forgetting at the same time that politics and economy are, as a matter of fact, human matters. The loss of human focus automatically results in the loss of the goal underpinning our common actions, which should consist in providing peace and well-being to every individual, to every family in our states. The policy aimed at serving people and their needs is founded on the notion of human dignity, which is an inherent feature of every human life. Talking about human-focused policy, a policy concentrated on the human need to live in peace and in decent conditions, we must think, first and foremost, about the need to defend human life.
Agenda 2030, which we jointly adopted, defines the model of SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT at the global level. Following its recommendations, we should concentrate our efforts on the elimination of poverty in all its representations, through the implementation of a series of economic, social and environmental goals. At the same time, it is incumbent on us to bear in mind that this process should take place with respect for all the related rights: the economic, social, political, civic, cultural ones, as well as the right to develop. By adopting Agenda 2030, we have demonstrated our ability to act as a community. Still, the implementation of its goals remains to be a formidable challenge which requires further close international cooperation.
Being a reliable and responsible partner, Poland is committed to full implementation of the goals, as specified in the Agenda for Sustainable Development. We believe that only by means of an effective implementation, will we be able to ensure relevant socio-economic conditions

for everyone. This involves coordination and comprehensive actions across many sectors and at all levels of governance, staring from the local, to the national, to regional, to international one.
Domestically, Poland takes concrete steps to implement the vision of development, in the spirit of Agenda 2030, to make sure that none of our citizens is excluded. The Strategy for Responsible Development, adopted by the Polish Government this February, is aimed at ensuring, both to Poland and the Polish people, a sustainable, stable, and, most importantly, a responsible kind of development. A development which will embrace both: the contemporary and the future generations.
In the international arena, Poland supports the countries who strive to develop economically and socially, among others by carrying out development cooperation. We want to ensure that our actions are as effective as possible. Therefore, using the experience of Polish administration and Polish NGOs, we address the states whom we are able to support in the most efficient way.
We are also watching with great concern and worry the growing number of people suffering as a result of protracted conflicts, especially those in Syria and Ukraine. Led by the sense of solidarity we are consistently increasing our humanitarian aid. Furthermore, we attach big importance to ensuring cohesion and complementarity between humanitarian and development aid.
What we consider to be of key importance is to eliminate the reasons of humanitarian crises. This is our common duty since the future of the world order and that of the international community depends on how we deliver. Moreover, we should permanently keep on our radar the issue of respect for and strengthening of the International Humanitarian Law.
One of the goals stipulated in Agenda 2030 is to stop changes taking place in our natural environment, which are perceivable in every country, on all continents. Such changes have a negative impact on national economies and on the living standards of entire communities. For a number of years now, Poland has continued to be part of global efforts to protect the environment and to fight climate change, and it has fulfilled its obligations in this respect. We have been able to surpass the reduction target as defined for us under the Kyoto Protocol. Along with the UE, we have been making the most ambitious global contribution to the Paris Agreement. We will continue our actions on the path to the low-carbon development, serving to protect the climate.
In the year to come Poland will have the honour to host, for the third time, the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The COP24 Climate Summit in Katowice will be of key importance due to the planned adoption of the implementation package for the Paris Agreement. As COP presidency, Poland will do its best in order to achieve the prospective ambitious results of the Summit. We will continue the leadership in climate negotiations in the spirit of the Paris Agreement, ensuring the participation of all states and the transparency of discussions. We will also respect differing domestic conditions of the respective Parties and their choices of the path leading to reduction in emissions.

= - ........ ....................................... ; _.,._.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Choosing Poland as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2018-2019 reflects the growing potential and involvement of my country for the sake of ENSURING INTERNTIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. Let me use this opportunity and express my heartfelt gratitude for all the 190 votes cast for Poland. This is one of the best results in the history of elections to the Security Council. We perceive this choice as both: an honour and an obligation.
I wish to thank the community of the United Nations for placing such a considerable confidence in us. We view our membership in the UN Security Council as a commitment to represent all UN member states, regardless of their affiliation with regional groups.
We accede the Security Council with the values which are particularly important to my nation. First and foremost, they include our strongest attachment to the right to sovereignty and freedom, inalienably vested in each nation. We accede the Security Council with the conviction that international law is the only effective mechanism to preserve peaceful relations among nations. Freedom is synonymous with peace. Enslavement is a source of war.
Currently, what has particular bearing on security are such aspects of freedom as the freedom of speech, and the freedom of self-determination in sovereign nation states. The reason I am mentioning that fact is that the previous year in particular featured intensified instances of manipulation of political processes in many states through hybrid measures: by means of propaganda or direct interference in the democratic processes. Such phenomena, such attempts taken by third countries to influence democratic policies pursued by free nations, should also come into the focus of concern of the international community.
The above fact, as much as the analysis of international relations in their current shape, do corroborate the thesis that security of the modern world should be viewed on many platforms. It is not only military strength of a given state that predetermines the sense of security of its citizens. The latter also embraces the areas which often transcend the regular framework of Security Council's works. What undermines the sense of security are also changes in natural environment, economic disparities, conflicts centered on natural resources, as well as all problems related to inadequate health protection. We do believe that also the abovementioned phenomena should be included to permanently feature in the works of the Security Council.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The respect and the absolute primacy of international law in relations among states safeguard our effectiveness in delivering security and international peace. As a Security Council nonpermanent member, Poland shall strive to make sure that all disputes and conflicts should be resolved in line with the fundamental principle of peaceful resolution.
In this context, we fully identify ourselves with the priority treatment given to mediation and conflict prevention, as advocated by the Secretary General. We are assisted in this respect by our conviction that preventive measures targeting the primary sources of problems, taken in the location concerned, shall produce the best, the quickest and the most tangible results. During my visit in the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa this year, I noted that an important capability of the international community is its ability to prevent conflicts. Conflicts

without reasons do not exist, and by the same token, there are no such conflicts which could not be brought to an end.
Such an approach should first and foremost, though not exclusively, be applied to issues related to mass migrations and refugees. Nowadays, these problems are shared by many regions and continents. Continued internal fighting and risks of terrorist attacks in the Middle East and in North Africa, as well as all challenges entailed, call for a common response from the whole international community.
This is why it is our obligation to eliminate the primary reasons behind the refugee problem, and to restore every man's right to live in his or her own home country. Humanitarian operations and development aid must be aimed at achieving the most fundamental goal of supporting the refugees to bring them back to their homes. Operations targeting the building of resilience of states and societies are particularly important in the context of limiting the reason behind such phenomena as structural poverty, unemployment, lack of access to education and other.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Poland has always been attaching immense importance to the effectiveness of international law. What underpins international law regulations is the principle of cooperation and of carrying out international obligations in good faith. This principle guarantees that international disputes shall be resolved by way of dialogue and not through aggression and armed violence. When confronted with a situation where states apply aggression as an instrument of their foreign policy, Poland is urging the international community not to recognize the accomplished facts which result from such a policy. Poland also wishes to contribute to the building of international order founded on the principles of political sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempt, be it successful or not, of violating these principles, will weaken mutual trust. For almost ten years in Georgia, and for the third year in Ukraine, have we been witnessing obvious violation of fundamental principles of UN Charter, including the principle of inviolability of borders, respect of sovereignty, renouncing the use of military force in resolution of disputes. In our view, absolute respect of international law lays down the foundation for a stable, foreseeable and peaceful setting of relations amongst states, and through it, the assurance of sustainable growth. The flagrant attempt to distort the world order prevailing nowadays is the situation in the Korean Peninsula, and the growing risk of its escalation. The development of the nuclear and missile program by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and especially the most recent test of nuclear weapons constitute a flagrant violation of international law, and of the UN Security Council resolution. We do hope that intensified efforts undertaken by the international community, including the respective UN Security Council resolutions, will allow us to close the spiral of tension and will bring about the stabilization of the situation in the region.
Poland sets great store by disarmament and the idea of the world free of nuclear weapons. The only real instrument at hand which could bring us closer to the achievement of this vision in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Treaty is subject to review every five years in order to take stock of its realization and to reinforce its commitments. Poland has now taken the lead in the preparation process for the upcoming review of the Treaty in 2020; an evidence of our longstanding commitment to non-proliferation, ban on nuclear tests and peaceful use of atomic energy.

Honorable Delegates,
The third pillar of the United Nations system, is the PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, the rights whose source is the supreme right to live. Most regrettably, there are all too many spots in the world where this right, as much as the dignity of a human person, personal freedom, or freedom of conscience and of religion, are taken away. A particularly visible problem is that of persecution of persons belonging to religious minorities, including Christians. Poland condemns in the strongest terms all instances of persecution and discrimination based on religion, and insists on the states' commitment to ensure protection to all members of religious minorities, in the spirit of the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The right to live in dignity should also embrace the right to uphold one's native traditions and the traditional family model, if these are compatible with fundamental rights of an individual.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In her campaign for the membership of the UN Security Council, Poland has chosen the motto: ""Solidarity-Responsibility- Engagement"". These are the values that we unceasingly seek to promote in the international arena. It is only the joint and several responsibility paired with harmonious engagement and cooperation among all states that will be able to produce sustainable development, security and peace not only for now, but also for future generations
to come.
Thank you very much for your attention."
Portugal,"Mr. President of the General Assembly, Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me start by expressing Portugal's condolences and solidarity to the people and government of Mexico for yesterday's violent tragedy.
I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. I welcome the priorities that you have established. Portugal fully supports an agenda centred on people and on the right that we all have to live a dignified life, in peace, on a sustainable planet. I also wish to express a word of appreciation to your predecessor, whose dedication and successes we most readily acknowledge.
Mr. Secretary-General,
I feel deeply moved to address today the ""Peoples' Assembly"" in the presence of the first Portuguese Secretary-General of the United Nations. Before you I solemnly pledge Portugal's commitment to the United Nations and multilateralism, founded on the primacy of International Law and the principles and values of the Charter.
Your priorities, Mr. Secretary General, are the same as ours: an organization that is stronger, offers greater solidarity and is capable of preventing conflicts, alleviating human suffering and promoting peace and prosperity. A more transparent United Nations, more effective, and more adaptable to a constantly changing world. We welcome and support the dynamism that you have shown right from the start of your mandate in reforming the United Nations System so that it may better fulfil its noble purpose. Only the United Nations holds a universal vocation to respond, in concert with Member States, to the increasingly complex challenges of our time.
Mr. Secretary-General,
Reforming the architecture of peace and security is an absolute priority. Consolidating a culture of conflict prevention requires action across the board and an integrated vision of the three pillars of the United Nations system - peace, human rights and sustainable development - as well as closer institutional cooperation between the organs of the Charter, namely the Security Council and the General Assembly.
Achieving sustainable peace will require greater synergies in the Organization's structures and missions on the ground. The ongoing efforts should also give fresh impetus to the reform of the Security Council to ensure a better representation of today's world. The African continent cannot be denied a permanent presence, and Brazil and India are also two inescapable examples. On the other hand, the complexity of the global problems we face requires us to foster partnerships, involving not only States, but also civil societies, international financial institutions, public and private entities.
I recall in this regard the General Assembly Resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, adopted a few days ago, which aims to strengthen the complementarities between the two Organizations. I would also like to underscore the importance of the Portuguese language, which is today an instrument of communication with a global dimension. By the middle of this century, the Portuguese language should reach almost 400 million speakers. This is what justified its adoption as an official language in several international organizations. The acceptance of Portuguese as one of the official languages of the United Nations remains a common design of the Member States of the CPLP.

Mr. President,
The Secretary General has elected diplomacy for peace as one of the main flags of his mandate. This idea must guide us when we react, as international community, to the conflicts and crises that regrettably occur today in various parts of the world. The unity and firmness of the international community, embodied in the United Nations, in defense of the law and in the promotion of security and stability, is what enables us to move towards a fairer international order, and to find the best answers to the serious crises we face today, from North Korean threats to the situation in Syria, from the instability in Libya to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and so many other sources of confrontation, security risk or humanitarian drama.
A global threat that challenges us all is terrorism. Portugal strongly and unequivocally condemns all terrorist acts; underlines the importance of preventing and fighting radicalization, violent extremism and recruitment; and actively participates in the struggle against terrorism, notably within the framework of the Global Coalition against ISIS. We welcome the military successes achieved in Iraq over the past year.
Promoting peace and security goes hand in hand with promoting development. The two dimensions are complementary and strengthen each other. For this reason, diplomatic mediation efforts and peace operations in conflict zones also require humanitarian support, development cooperation and institutional capacity building for affected populations and States.
One of the clearest priorities of Portuguese foreign policy is the participation in Peacekeeping Operations and institution building within the framework of the United Nations. As a European and Atlantic country, with deep historical and cultural links to Africa, Portugal pays particular attention to partnerships between the two continents.
The first Summit between Europe and Africa took place in 2000, under the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union. The fifth European Union-African Union Summit to be held in Abidjan next November will be an excellent opportunity to better define the priorities of the Strategic Partnership between the European Union and Africa. The chosen theme, Youth, allows a much needed integrated approach which addresses issues of education and employment, demographic dynamics and economic growth, gender equality and civic participation.
The African continent has made important progress in recent years. We welcome the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union. There are many signs of hope, both politically and economically. The successful implementation of Agenda 2030 will be another important step.
However, numerous disturbances still need to be overcome. Portugal strives to do its part. First, through participation in various Peacekeeping and Stabilization Operations, within the framework of the United Nations and the European Union. We have reinforced our presence, without ever restricting the use of our troops, in the multilateral missions in the Sahel and Central Africa region, namely MINUSMA in Mall and MINUSCA in the Central African Republic. Secondly, through cooperation with many African partners in promoting maritime security, in particular in the Gulf of Guinea, to combat piracy and trafficking in people, drugs and weapons, to protect international trade, as well as from a strategic point of view, both for Africa and Europe.
Mr. President,
Peace and sustainable development are built on respect for the rights and dignity of the human person.

Portugal defends a Human Rights diplomacy. For us, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are inseparable and interdependent. They apply universally and do not depend on place, history, or the religious or civilizational matrix of each society. Upholding these rights is a task for all us, requiring dialogue and concerted action. Our mandate at the Human Rights Council, which ends this year, was guided by these principles and they will continue to guide us in the future.
In 2017, we celebrate 150 years of the abolition of the death penalty in Portugal. We have been pioneers in this cause and will continue to stand for the universal abolition of capital punishment.
The situation of migrants and refugees remains on the agenda. We have a moral obligation to protect and promote the rights of those who, like so many others before them, are forced to leave their homes and families in search of security and a better future. This is the principle that should serve as the basis for the Global Compact, which we pledged last year, to prepare and approve.
I underline, in this context, the work of the Global Platform for Support to Syrian Students, an initiative of the former President of Portugal, Jorge Sampaio. This is to guarantee the access to higher education for those young Syrians who, because of the conflict in their country, have been deprived of this universal right. I invite all countries that have not yet done so to join the Platform and support the Rapid Response Mechanism for Higher Education.
Mr. President,
For peace and development to be truly sustainable, we must show respect for our common home and for future generations. To protect and to preserve the planet is to nurture peace and prevent potential new conflicts caused by competition in access to diminishing resources.
In this regard, the Paris Agreement is a milestone in reducing the impacts of climate change. We cannot do without this universal instrument if we are to achieve the objectives of the environmental pillar of Agenda 2030.
Portugal will comply with the European Union's voluntary commitment to reduce 40% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and will contribute to the Green Climate Fund meant to help developing countries to adapt to climate change.
Agenda 2030 - the Sustainable Development Objectives - is the most powerful statement of our multilateral commitment to the rights of people, the quality of life of populations and the future of our planet. Portugal stands for these goals, which guide us both in our domestic policy and in our foreign and cooperation efforts.
All 17 Goals are very important to us. But we believe that, because of our history and the international action on the preservation and enhancement of marine resources, the Oceans' goal is one in which we believe our participation can bring greater added-value within the framework of the United Nations.
Source of life, knowledge, of so many resources and exchanges, the Oceans, which occupy 71% of the surface of our planet, are a top priority in any strategy for sustainable development. The need for action is pressing and wide-ranging, as was evident a week ago in Lisbon, in another ""Meeting of the Oceans"", which Portugal promoted, with the participation of dozens of countries, and which was this year dedicated to the theme ""The Ocean and Human Health"".
The first United Nations Conference dedicated to conservation and sustainable exploitation of the oceans. It was a privilege for Portugal to participate in the preparatory process for the Conference, as co-facilitator, along with Singapore, of the political document that resulted from it, ""Our Ocean,

Our Future: Call For Action"". I reiterate here my country's willingness to host the follow-up Conference in 2020. In our view, the sustainability of the oceans requires a strengthening of their governance. For this reason, we believe that the General Assembly should formally decide on the beginning of the negotiations, starting in 2018, of a new legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President, However varied the challenges we face today, however serious the risks and threats that afflict us, we are certain to make progress when we have clear goals and know how to establish partnerships to reach them. Multilateralism is the only framework for the defense of the common good of humanity and the collective promotion of peace, security and development. In no way does it diminish the sovereignty of each nation, nor the capacity for decision of their people and institutions. But the fraternal cooperation promoted by multilateralism adds to our own strength the strength of those who follow the same path. This is the way of the United Nations; the direction is the agenda of the United Nations. Diplomacy for Peace, Diplomacy for Human Rights, the Climate Agenda, the Agenda 2030. My country is part and contributes to all of them. For the sake of humanity, which is our common condition. Thank you very much.

President_of_the_General_Assembly_(closing),"Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen What a week we have had. 196 statements were delivered from this podium. It is the first time in 11 years that all Member States and Observers addressed the General Assembly. I followed them closely. Many I listened to firsthand. When it was not possible for me to do so, I asked my team to send me a report, directly, after every statement was delivered. Thanks of their hard work, I have been able to listen to you all. I will not attempt to summarize all 196 statements into this short speech. I would not be able to capture the diversity and complexity of the issues raised. And I would fail to replicate the passion and experience which you brought from your own nations, cities, or homes, onto this podium. I will do three things instead: 1/ I will focus on people. I have committed to doing this throughout the next Session, so today is no different. 2/ I will review the priorities for the 72nd Session, in light of the input I received from you. 3/ I will look to the weeks, and months ahead. Excellencies, We addressed many challenges over the past week. You talked about their impact on the countries of the world. Importantly, you also talked about their impact on people. We heard about people running from gunshots - or the force of exploding bombs. People living for a week on the same amount some of us spend on a cup of coffee. People forced to make the decision between risking their lives to stay, or risking their lives to flee. People wondering when the next hurricane will hit, or if their village will be under water in a few decades. People who are beginning to lose  or have already lost hope in international peace processes. And people still waiting for justice and human rights to become a part of their daily reality. Your statements didn't just focus on challenges, however. They also spoke of solutions. And the people who are working to find them. We heard accounts of strength, resilience, partnerships, and entrepreneurial spirit.

I want to thank you all for placing people at the center of this General Debate. Over the next session, I am confident that we can do even more. We can bring our discussions and actions closer to the people they most affect.

Now I want to focus on the 72nd session in more depth. I knew my own priorities before the General Debate began. What I didn't know was how you would respond to them. Let me now outline some of the messages I will be taking away from your statements.
First, I heard overwhelming support for the proposal to prioritize peace and prevention. Many of you reiterated the call of the Secretary-General for a surge in diplomacy to stop today's conflicts. And you called for the UN to do more to prevent conflicts from breaking out. We must draw from national, regional and international experiences of mediation and conflict prevention. We must realign our approach to emphasize the peace in what we now call peace and security.
You also stressed your continued support to UN peacekeeping. Peace operations are doing a vital job. They work to protect civilians. They support national actors to build and maintain peace. We heard that some of your citizens have paid the ultimate price while serving under the UN flag. I want to thank you, on behalf of the General Assembly, for your ongoing commitment.
Second, you talked about the needs of people all over the world. You expressed a vision in which human rights, gender equality, and the rule of law are norms. Today they often unfortunately remain the
exceptions. So, we have more work to do in realizing this vision.
I also heard calls for us to look beyond the labels of refugee or migrant, to see, simply, people. Many of you told us about the work you are doing for these people, and to support the states and communities hosting them. Additionally, many of you stressed the need for a comprehensive global framework.
Third, you reminded us all of the promises we have made to people and the planet. Throughout the week, we listened to accounts of the work being done to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. Some of you also made clear that climate change has become a matter of life or death  for people, ecosystems, ways of life and, even, entire countries. It was therefore heartening to witness a major show of support for the Paris Climate Agreement in this hall.
Finally, you reaffirmed your commitment to the UN. And to each other. You said we are stronger together, in a system based on dialogue and multilateralism. And you stressed that any alternative would risk repeating the mistakes of history.
But many of you also acknowledged two things:
One, that the world is changing. This change is for both good and bad. It is happening at a fast pace.
And two, that the UN must do more to adapt to this change. Over the coming session, we will hear more of your ideas and positions on how this should happen. I am committed to ensuring that our discussions are as open, inclusive and transparent as possible.
I want to pause here, to speak frankly. Not all of the messages delivered at the General Debate were positive. Many of them contained criticisms of other countries, or of the UN. But that is part of the package. It is your right to do this. And regardless of size, or population, or economy, all delegations have access to the same platform, for the same amount of time. They can speak freely, without censorship.
We must remember that differences in unilateral positions do not prevent multilateral agreement. They might give us more work to do. Our negotiations might be more difficult. But they can also

make the outcome stronger. So, I want to embrace both the consensus and contention that came as part of this year's General Debate.
Excellencies,
The only thing left to do is to look ahead. The 72nd Session will involve milestones. Some of them are already on the calendar. For example, the high-level event on Sustaining Peace, in April, or the adoption of Global Compacts related to Migrants and Refugees in September. Already, this week, the General Assembly will convene a High-level meeting related to trafficking in persons. This shows our readiness to follow up on mandates inherited from previous sessions from an early stage. And I'm sure that other major events will happen throughout the year, in response to the initiative of Member States, or in reaction to events happening around the world.
Additionally, the work of the main committees of the General Assembly will soon begin. All six committees are important tools for multilateralism. We should make use of them.
Before I conclude, I want to thank all those who contributed to the General Debate of the 72nd Session. Thanks to the Member States and observers for standing up here, and outlining their visions. I want to acknowledge the Vice Presidents for their able chairing on my behalf. And I want to say thank you everyone who worked to ensure the smooth running of the Debate and the security
of everyone participating in it - in particular our DGACM colleagues. These people didn't stand on the podium, but we wouldn't be here without all the work they did - out of the spotlight, and behind the scenes.
I'm sure many of the delegations here today are breathing a sigh of relief. High-level representatives have returned to capital. Schedules no longer contain back-to-back meetings and events. Most of you probably deserve a break.
But the people we all represent the people I've talked about today  need us to do the opposite.
They need us to focus on action now more than ever.
So, let's get to work.
And, with that, I thank you again, and bring the General Debate of the 72nd Session to a close."
President_of_the_General_Assembly_(opening),"Heads of State and Government, Distinguished Ministers, Excellencies, Mr. SecretaryGeneral, Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am honored to welcome you all to New York for the General Debate of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly.
I wish, however, that I could deliver a speech today, which is different to the one I prepared.
I wish I could point to a long list of examples of mediation and early action successfully averting conflicts. I would prefer to talk only about people who move and migrate out of choice - not desperation. It would be great to congratulate you all for meeting your climaterelated commitments, and for relegating extreme poverty to the history books.
I hope that someone will, eventually, be able to deliver such a speech from this marble podium. But it cannot be me today.
Instead, conflict persists as an ugly reality of our world. Civilians  not soldiers  are paying the highest price. Schools and hospitals  not military barracks  are the targets of attacks.
I must also talk today about over 65 million people leaving their homes because they are forced to do so - not because they want to. I have to use my speech today to address other major challenges, including persistent poverty, growing inequalities, indiscriminate terrorist attacks, and worsening effects of climate change.
These are global challenges - every country is coping with at least one. But they are also individual in nature, touching on the lives of each person.
That is not to say that there is nothing to celebrate today. We have made a collective promise to humanity by signing up to the SDGs. We have rallied in support of peace agreements, such as that seen in Colombia. We have said ""enough is enough"" when it comes to climate change by signing the Paris Agreement.
But we are not here today to dwell on our past achievements. We are here to look ahead. We will hear visions, ideas and  yes  criticisms and concerns over the coming week. These will chart the course of the UN as it works to address the most urgent global challenges. I am

confident that they will also travel home with you, and influence your work as the world's leaders.
I will now, myself, start the ball rolling by outlining my vision for the 72nd Session.
First, peace and prevention should be at the center of everything the UN does. Because, if you read the UN Charter, there are only 5 references to ""war"". The word ""peace"", however, appears 47 times...
Unfortunately we are spending too much time and money reacting to conflicts, and not enough on preventing them. We need to recalibrate our efforts around peace and prevention. That is the only way to ensure that the UN is doing the job for which it was created.
I want to be clear: placing peace and prevention first is not about requesting more capacity from the outside. The UN already has most of the tools it needs. What we are missing are the conditions in which they can be properly used.
And the Sustaining Peace resolutions should be at the top of our toolbox. They challenge us to strengthen our response to crises before they result in the outbreak or recurrence of conflict. They call for a renewed focus on prevention. For this vision to come to life, these resolutions must be implemented. I hope to contribute to this process during my Presidency.
Prevention must become a greater part of the General Assembly's work. This will be important in our ongoing review of UN peace operations, and our engagement with the UN's first office of counterterrorism.
Prevention must also be better integrated into our development and human rights work. When people can live decent lives - when rights are respected - when rule of law is present in everyday life  it is harder to turn societies to conflict.
Second, a stronger focus must be placed on people.
This is because the UN was not made for diplomats or dignitaries. It was made for people.
We know that many people have become disillusioned. Countless others around the world, however, have high hopes for us. They see the UN's blue flag as a first sign of safety and the beginning of change.
One of the biggest tests for us will be the process to adopt the first Global Compact for Migration. Let me be frank here. This will be a difficult process. The issue of migration is highly divisive. We all have a different opinion on it. But we cannot turn this into an exercise of bureaucracy. We cannot be left with an agreement that works only on paper.
Another major challenge that demands a focus on people is international terrorism. This is not a problem that can be solved with guns, or shut out by barriers. People are at its center. They are the ones contributing to it. They are the ones suffering because of it.
The only way to succeed in both areas will be through choosing to focus on people, rather than rigidly sticking to our individual positions. We need viable global frameworks, which can be implemented by people - and for people - in real time.

But I want to stress one thing: we cannot fail. If we do, how can we claim that the UN is the best forum in which to address global challenges? Those who are cynical about the UN will be proven right. Others will find it hard to hold on to their hope.
A focus on people must also be more strongly felt in the humanitarian field. UN access and help to those in dire need cannot be compromised by any party. Violations of International Humanitarian Law are too common, and accountability for these crimes is too rare.
Finally, we must keep the promises we have made to advance prosperity and protect the planet.
Through the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement we made a clear commitment. We promised to improve the lives of all people, and secure the future of the planet we live on. However we will not be able to achieve this without securing enough finances. We cannot sit and wait patiently for trillions of dollars to materialize. We must go out and search for them. This will involve more engagement with the private sector and financial institutions.
I see the priority clusters of 1/ peace and prevention, 2/ people and 3/ planet and prosperity as three sides of a triangle. They might not all be the same length, or the same width, but one is as important as the other.
I am confident that this triangle will point in the direction of promising prospects for our world.
Excellencies,
Let us not forget other, important issues that need to be mainstreamed.
Human rights are crucial. Neither peace nor development can take hold without them.
We must remember that we have a lot of work to do when it comes to gender equality. Women's leadership and participation should be a priority in settings of both conflict and peace.
UN Reforms will also be a main priority. There must be open and inclusive dialogue among Member States regarding the Secretary-General's reform proposals. I will work to facilitate this. I will also personally engage closely with Member States to strengthen the role of the General Assembly. And I will promote a credible process to address the reform of the Security Council.
Finally, the UN should be opening its doors wider. We must strengthen our engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders, including regional and sub-regional organizations, civil society and the private sector. We need to hear more young voices in this Hall.
Excellencies,
Before I conclude, allow me to make a more personal observation. (Pause)
I want to say that we cannot call for an end to business as usual - and then continue to do business as usual. If we are looking for a change in how the UN operates around the world,

we should start here in New York. This can mean institutional change. But it can also mean a change in the way we work on a daily basis.
We can engage in real dialogue  not a succession of monologues. We can concentrate on how much  and not how little  we can give up in the spirit of compromise. We can look beyond our individual agendas and positions, and see the bigger picture of why the UN is here, and what it is trying to do.
I may not have been able to deliver a happy statement today, praising us all for making the world a better place to live in. But I will work throughout this year to increase the chances that, someday, one of my successors will have this great privilege.
I wish you success in your deliberations, which I am confident will be in the interest and to the benefit of all people. Thank you!"
Republic_of_Korea,"First of all, on behalf of the people and government of the Republic of Korea, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my deepest sympathy to the victims of the earthquake that hit Mexico on September !9 and their families as well as the people and Government of Mexico.
I offer my respect and gratitude to all member states and the staff of the United Nations Secretariat for their contributions to world peace and security.
I congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajak on his election as the President of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly. I expect that this session will reap all the more meaningful results under his excellent leadership.
I also wish Secretary-General Antonio Guterres great success. The Republic of Korea takes a strong stance in support of the U.N. goals aimed at the prevention of conflicts and sustaining peace. I look forward to the rebirth of the United Nations as an even stronger organization fostering peace and prosperity for all peoples during his tenure as Secretary-General.
Mr. President, Secretary-General and distinguished delegates,
As I prepared this address, I thought about the spirit of the United Nations and the joint mission of us all.
The United Nations is perhaps one of the best institutional inventions created by human intelligence. It was born ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and has unremittingly met the challenges confronting humanity over the past 70 years The roles and contributions of the United Nations in the international community will continue to grow over time.

Today, the number of transnational issues is ever-increasing and no country can resolve them single-handedly. For this reason, we should truly- fulfill the spirit of the United Nations to find solutions to all the problems facing us.
To this end, I hope everyone will pay attention to the Republic of Korea, located on the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at the east end of the Eurasian continent.
I believe the candlelight rallies last winter in the Republic of Korea created a historic moment that is evidence of the brilliant achievement of the spirit of the United Nations. With the power of cooperation and solidarity in defiance of challenges, the rallies forged ahead toward a future aspired to by humanity.
Some of you may remember the scenes of the candlelight rallies shown by the media: streets packed with millions of lights, people expressing their opinions freely and joining in discussions on every street corner where there was singing, dancing and painting, the radiant faces of the parents who took their children by hand to join rallies and the pride of young people who picked up trash on the streets afterwards--all these scenes were very much a part of democracy and peace.
The candlelight revolution in Korea started in a public square where the yearning for restoration of democracy and the Constitution awakened the citizens' collective intelligence. I too participated in the rallies myself just as a citizen. The people of the Republic of Korea achieved democracy in the most peaceful and beautiful manner. They proved the power of popular sovereignty, the quintessence of democracy. They also proved the fact that the power of peace rather than violence can bring greater changes to the world.
The new Administration of the Republic of Korea is made possible by the candlelight revolution. Above and beyond the meaning of a democratic election, this means that the Administration was launched by the participation and aspirations of the people and their awareness that they are the rightful owners of the nation. I am now standing here on behalf of that Administration.
I am very gratified with and also proud of the fact that the Republic of Korea, though belatedly a democracy, showed the world a new hope for democracy.
Now building on that strength, the Republic of Korea intends to p!ay a_n_ active role in addressing pending issues facing the international community.
2

Mr. President,
The Republic of Korea has always taken joint steps with the United Nations. Since the establishment of the Government in 1948, the Republic of Korea has received significant assistance from the United Nations both during the Korean War and in the process of post-war reconstruction. Even though it was not until 1991 that the Republic of Korea could become a member of the United Nations, the country has enhanced its roles and responsibilities as a member state faster than any other nation in the span of just one generation.
From 1993 onwards, Korea has continued to participate in peacekeeping operations. This year, as Chair of the Peace building Commission, it is focusing on resolving the root causes of conflicts.
Over the past five years, the Republic of Korea has increased financial assistance for refugees by 15 times, and last year, it joined the UNHCR's ""20million-plus dollar donors' club."" Now expediting the implementation of the Paris Agreement and a shift in energy policy, the Korean Government is also taking the lead in supporting the climate change responses of developing countries through the Global Green Growth Institute and the Green Climate Fund. On top of this, my Administration has met the goal of filling 30 percent of the Cabinet with female ministers, thereby spearheading the efforts to realize gender equality, one of the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
In the years to come, the Republic of Korea will significantly increase its contributions to the United Nations in a!1 sectors,
Among other things, it is truly meaningful that the theme of this session of the U.N. General Assembly ""Focusing on People"" is in line with the philosophy of governance of the new Administration in the Republic of Korea. ""People come first"" is the slogan I have used for several years to express my political philosophy. And the ""people"" are at the center of all policies of my new Administration.
As of now, my Administration is pursuing bold measures to change the economic paradigm in order to deal with economic inequalities that stand in the way of growth and social cohesion. We are now pursuing economic policies focusing on the income growth of individuals and households, and promoting an economy where growth is !ed by job creation and al! people can enjoy equal opportunities and the fruits of growth. This is what we call a 'people-centered
economy'.
3

My Administration's determined endeavors to realize inclusive growth will not be confined to our country. In accordance with this new paradigm, the Republic of Korea will render support for sustainable growth in developing countries.
Mr. President,
I was born in a refugee town in the middle of the Korean war. This civil war, which evolved into an international war, devastated the lives of countless people. Over three million lost their lives, and many of the survivors were deprived of decent living. My father was also one of them. My father, who thought he was taking temporary refuge at that time, could never make it back to his hometown before he passed away. I come from one of the separated families, the victims whose human rights were violated by the War.
The War has yet to come to a complete end. The Korean War, a war that began as an offshoot of the larger Cold War conflict, continues to this day. Though the Cold War ended, and 64 years have passed since the conclusion of the Armistice Agreement, the War remains ongoing in the form of an uneasy ceasefire on the Peninsula, the last residual Cold War order in Northeast Asia. As tensions soar in Northeast Asia due to the North Korean nuclear and missile issue, the memory of war and wounds become more pronounced, and hearts aspiring to peace pound painfully; this is the Republic of Korea on the Korean Peninsula in September 2017.
For me, the President of the only divided country, peace is a calling and a historical duty. I am representing my fellow citizens who sent out a message of peace through the candlelight revolution to the global village where wars and conflicts know no end. At the same time, I am entrusted with a responsibility to safeguard the people's rights to peace--to an undisturbed daily life--as a universal value.
For these very reasons, I hope North Korea wi!! be able to choose on its own a path leading to peace. I believe peace when chosen willingly becomes sound and sustainable.
More than anything else,  I'm grateful that my convictions are joined by the international community.
4

Despite the international community's concerted demand and warnings, and to our great disappointment and indignation, North Korea recently carried out its sixth nuclear test and further missile provocations. In the wake of the nuclear test, the Korean Government has made enhanced efforts to convince countries in the region and beyond of the necessity for stronger sanctions and pressure to make North Korea stop its provocations and choose the path of dialogue.
I highly appreciate the U.N. Security Council's unanimous adoption of the North Korea sanctions resolution with unprecedented speed, and with tougher measures than previous resolutions. This clearly reflects that the international community is collectively outraged and is responding under one voice on the North Korean nuclear issue and on the problems occurring on the Korean Peninsula. Once again, as the party directly involved with issues concerning the Korean Peninsula, I would !ike to express my appreciation to the international community for its shared understanding and support towards the position of the Korean Government.
Despite North Korea's flagrant violation of its obligations and commitments under the U.N. Charter, the Korean Government and the international community are making every possible effort with great determination to peacefully solve the North Korean nuclear issue. The U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions against North Korea, which have articulated the principles of a peaceful, diplomatic and political resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, are also part of these efforts.
Once again b_ere at the UoNo General Assembly where nations pledge actions for world peace and the mutual prosperity of all peoples, I make the following points very clear to North Korea and the international community.
We do not desire the collapse of North Korea. We will not seek unification by absorption or artificial means, if North Korea makes a decision even now to stand on the right side of history, we are ready to assist North Korea together with the international community.
North Korea should acknowledge all these immutable facts as soon as possible. It must immediately cease malting reckless choices that could lead to its own isolation and downfall and choose the path of dialogue. I urge North Korea to abandon its hostile policies against other countries and give up its nuclear weapons program in a verifiable and irreversible way.

The efforts of the international community should also be further strengthened. It has to strongly and sternly respond until North Korea gives up its nuclear program of its own accord. All nations must thoroughly implement the U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions and seek new measures in case of any further provocations by the North. It is also important to manage the situation in a stable manner. All of our endeavors are to prevent the outbreak of war from breaking out and maintain peace. In that respect, the situation surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue needs to be managed stably so that tensions will not become overly intensified or accidental military clashes will not destroy peace. We should all remind ourselves of what former U.S. President Ronald Reagan said: ""Peace is not absence of conflict, it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful
means.""
I would like to make a special request to the member states of the United Nations and in particular to the UN. Security Council. In order to fundamentally solve the North Korean nuclear issue, the basic spirit of a security community enshrined in the U.N. Charter should be fulfilled on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia. The basic pillar of security in Northeast Asia and multilateralism should be wisely combined.
The spirit of the United Nations is to realize global peace through multilateral dialogue. The Korean Peninsula is where that spirit is most desperately needed. The realization of peace is the issue for which the United Nations was created, for which it is aiming and which it is in the process of achieving. We need the United Nations to play a more active role on the Korean Peninsula. The most important role the United Nations is asked to play today is to come up with fundamental measures to stop the vicious cycle of increased provocations and heightened sanctions.
On many occasions, I have announced a new economic map for the Korean Peninsula and a new vision for the northern economy. I believe that genuine peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia will begin when the foundation for a Northeast Asian economic community is solidified on one side and multilateral security cooperation is materialized on the other
Distinguished President, Secretary-General and delegates,
The Olympics had not been he!d for as many as !,500 years until it was reintroduced in 1896. The force behind the revival of the Olympics was the thirst for peace. The history of the modem Olympics started with the overwhelming
6

emotion of the first Olympics held in Athens on the Balkan Peninsula, which was once the center of conflicts.
Five months from now, the Olympic Winter Games will be held in Pyeong Chang, the Republic of Korea. It is the first of a series of Olympics to be held in Northeast Asia: Pyeong Chang in 2018, Tokyo in 2020 and Beij ing in 2022.
I aspire for these three Olympics to become an opportunity for promoting peace and economic cooperation in Northeast Asia where the remnants of the Cold War and hope for the future as well as confrontation and cooperation coexist. The Republic of Korea is ready to make every possible effort for that.
Please imagine for a moment: People from a!! around the world who love peace and sports will be gathered in Pyeong Chang, which is only 100 kilometers away from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the symbol of division and confrontation on the Korean Peninsula. Heads of states and governments from al! comers of the world will exchange greetings of friendship and harmony. My heart is filled with great joy when I imagine North Korean athletes marching into the stadium during the opening ceremony, a South-North Korean joint cheering squad enthusiastically welcoming them alongside the brightly smiling faces of people from all over the world. It is not an impossible dream. To turn this into a reality, I will make wholehearted endeavors until the end in cooperation with the IOC in order to welcome the North Koreans to the Pyeong Chang Winter Olympics.
I hope that Pyeong Chang will become another candle to be lit. Like the candles the Korean people held out in the face of the crisis of democracy, I believe that Pyeong Chang will become a candlelight that sheds light on peace when peace is threatened.
I hope that all of you and the United Nations will light your candles. I hope you will put your hearts and minds together to go hand in hand with peace.
Today, with that heartfelt-pledge, I invite the heads of state and government from around the world to come to Pyeong Chang. The steps you take, together, will become a march for peace.
I look forward to seeing you all in Pyeong Chang next year.
Thank you very much.

Republic_of_Moldova,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,
At the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate H.E. Miroslav Lajcak, on his election as President of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly, wishing him success in fulfilling his important mandate.
My thanks go also to his predecessor, H.E. Mr. Peter Thomson, for his dedication and professionalism in conducting the works of the previous session.
I take this opportunity to express words of encouragement and support to the Secretary General, Mr. Antdnio Guterres. I am confident that with his competent leadership and the joint efforts of the Member States, we will succeed in redefining the role of the United Nations and adjusting it to the requirements of the modern world.
Mr. President,
Clearly, all of us gathered in this great hall are deeply concerned by the challenges that the international community is confronted with. The armed conflicts in the Middle East, the protracted conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism, the affliction caused by poverty are only some of the phenomena that undermine peace and sustainable development.
We are equally concerned by the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons and the development of nuclear programs. An international environment marked by the threats to use force, including nuclear arms, greatly exacerbates the sense of insecurity and lack of trust.
The devastating natural disasters occurring with increasing frequency in a warming world affect hundreds of millions of people, especially those living in extreme poverty. In this context, I wish to express words of compassion and deep condolences to the countries and families affected by the recent devastating hurricanes, as well by the earthquake in
Mexico.
The statements delivered by the previous speakers illustrate that we all have similar perceptions about global problems. Today, more than ever, we need a joint commitment of all UN Member States to face those challenges.
In this context, I would like to reiterate my country's full support to the Secretary General Gutteres's agenda of reforms that puts a renewed emphasis on the conflict prevention, on the repositioning of the development and reforming the UN's internal management in order to effectively address the major challenges the world is confronted with.

Mr. President,
After the signing by the Republic of Moldova in June 2014 of the Association Agreement with the European Union, my country has engaged in a complex process of structural reforms aiming at building a modern society based on the European development model.
Our steady efforts are concentrated on the consolidation of the rule of law, the development of a functional market economy with a prominent social dimension and the respect for human rights. The strategic priorities for sectorial development entail, first of all, the modernization of infrastructure, efficient resource management, the promotion of green economy and renewable energy, as well as the application of modern technologies in agriculture. We have also undertaken to reform the public administration and the public services, while ensuring gender equality and the promotion of youth.
We have the necessary political will to fully implement those reforms and, in this endeavor, we will continue to rely on the support of our development partners, particularly the European Union and the United Nations.
Mr. President,
The Republic of Moldova fully shares the view that prevention and peaceful settlement of conflicts, particularly the protracted ones, are indispensable premises for implementing the Agenda for Development 2030.
The lack of progress in protracted conflict's settlement should prompt a more direct involvement from the appropriate UN bodies. We believe that no conflict in the world should be left out of the UN's attention, irrespective of whether they are on the Security Council's agenda or not.
We appreciate the fact that the General Assembly agreed to include and maintains on its agenda an item addressing the ""Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and development"". The General Assembly' s debates under this item do not undermine, as some fear, the existing mechanisms to negotiate settlements of these conflicts.
On the contrary, the continuing monitoring of the situation in the concerned area, together with a proactive approach by the UN when its involvement is needed, can prevent or counter attempts aimed at changing the political borders of some GUAM states through methods that have nothing in common with democracy and the international law.
I take this opportunity to express the Republic of Moldova's deep concern regarding the ongoing armed conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine, a conflict that endangers the peace and security in our region. Let me reiterate again our full support to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.

Mr. President,
Since 1992, from this high UN rostrum, we repeatedly referred to the unresolved conflict in the Eastern part of the Republic of Moldova, a conflict that is also complicated by the illegal stationing of foreign military forces on our national territory.
We have underlined that, unlike other similar conflicts in the post-soviet space, the transnistrian conflict, while less intricate, could be resolved more easily should all the parties concerned display the necessary political will. In our case, there are no ethnic or religious enmities, and the population on the both banks of the Nistru River could live in peace and mutual understanding within a reintegrated Moldovan state.
Despite our efforts throughout the last twenty-five years with the involvement of international actors, we have not succeeded to settle this political conflict. We will continue our efforts to identify a solution in the existing 5+2 settlement format. For us, it is extremely important that this solution is based on the respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, providing a special status for the transnistrian region, as stipulated in relevant OSCE documents.
We firmly believe that the settlement process could be underpinned by the transformation of the current ""trilateral peacekeeping force"" that includes also a Russian contingent, into a multinational civilian mission with international mandate.
In this regard, I would like to underline that this trilateral disengagement force, which was established in accordance with the Moldovan-Russian ceasefire agreement of 21 July 1992, has long ago fulfilled its scope. This obsolete mechanism has turned into a factor of conflict preservation and has failed to ensure the full demilitarization of the security zone and to eliminate the obstacles to the free movement of people, goods and services.
Mr. President,
Against our expectations, the Russian Federation has not yet withdrawn its military forces from territory of the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with its international commitments, as stipulated in the Moldovan-Russian ceasefire agreement of July 1992, in the Moldovan-Russian agreement of October 1994, as well as in the relevant OSCE documents, in particular the Political Declaration adopted at the OSCE Istanbul Summit in 1999.
I would like to make clear here that these military forces are distinct and shall not be mistaken for the Russian contingent that participates in the ""trilateral peacekeeping force"" operating on the basis of an ad-hoc arrangement.

The military exercises conducted regularly in the transnistrian region by the Russian troops, with the increased participation of paramilitary forces belonging to separatist regime in Tiraspol, pose a continuous security threat to the Republic of Moldova. These joint military drills are in flagrant violation of express obligations stipulated in the Moldovan-Russian ceaseJre agreement of 1992 to strictly respect the principle of neutrality with regards to the two parties of the conflict.
Distinguished delegates,
According to OSCE reports, the stores of the Operative Group of the Russian Troops contain more than twenty-one thousand metric tons of weapons and ammunition.
The Government of the Republic of Moldova neither control nor supervise those weapons and munitions. Due to complete lack of access to the weapons and munitions' stockpiles controlled by the foreign forces, it is effectively prevented to assess the technical condition of those munitions, some of which may pose substantial environmental danger, or to monitor weapons and munitions transfers within its territory or abroad.
For the same reasons, the Republic of Moldova is unable to fulfill its international obligations, as a State Party, under various international disarmament conventions. While located on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, those weapons and munitions are not under its ""jurisdiction or control"".
Taking into account the commitments assumed by the Russian Federation, the fundamental principles of international law and the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova regarding its status of permanent neutrality and non-admission of deployment of military troops of other states on our national territory, we firmly reiterate the request for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the so-called Operative Group of the Russian Troops (a successor of the former 14th Soviet army) which is illegally stationed on the territory of the Republic of Moldova.
Let me also invoke in this context the Declaration by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova of 21 of July 2017 (distributed earlier to all UN Member States as an official document of the General Assembly and the Security Council), calling on the Russian Federation to resume and finalize the process of withdrawal of its troops and munitions from the territory of the Republic of Moldova.
Distinguished delegates,
Mindful that the United Nations has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security and in accordance with article 11 of the UN Charter, the Republic of Moldova requests the inclusion in the agenda of the seventy-second session of the UN General Assembly of a new item entitled ""The withdrawal or foreign military forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova.""

From this perspective, I would respectfully call upon all UN member states to support this legitimate request that is fully compliant with the principles of the UN Charter and represents a fundamental interest of the Republic of Moldova.
We hope that the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the General Assembly and its further consideration by the UN Member States, in a constructive and non-politicized manner, would constitute and important and necessary exercise of preventive diplomacy vis-a-vis a country and region where the maintenance of peace and security is continuously undermined by the lack of dialogue that is based on mutual respect and the respect for the fundamental principles of international law.
I thank you for your attention."
Romania,"Mr. Secretary General,

Mr. President of the General Assembly,

Your Excellencies,

..

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let me welcome this year's focus on peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet. These are very important objectives, which require all of our determination, as responsible leaders, in order to reach them, especially when we see the challenges before us. Indeed, people across the globe still suffer from the brutal effects of war, poverty, inequality and injustice. Tensions over cultural identity and faith are rising even within traditionally open and tolerant societies. Natural disasters cause increasing damage every season. Terrorist attacks deepen the sense of insecurity. Even if there are some perceptions that the United Nations did not manage well the multitude and complexity of the new crises, it is clear that no other path serves us better than muitilateralism in finding viable solutions for the current global challenges. More than ever, a rule-based international system - the International Ru!e of Law - is paramount for our success. The UN has to be equipped with the essential tools to perform as an efficient organization that reflects the will of its Members and enjoys the trust of all the people of the globe. At the same time, we, the Member States, need to increase our commitment towards the Organization. Ladies and gentlemen, Developing and sustaining peace require not only a swift and adequate response to crises, but also an understanding of the root causes of conflicts and insecurity, which are rarely emerging from one single source.
2

At the same time, the UN agenda is not only about conflicts and crises, but also about sustainable development and promoting human rights. It is about hope in a decent life for all, the only way to build a safe and sustainable planet. Working on education, ensuring prosperity of our people are the most efficient ways to prevent instability and crises. Focusing our actions on people should remain the ultimate goal. How to achieve this aim? We have to drive the implementation of the ambitious global Agenda for Development forward, including in relation with conflict prevention and sustaining peace, as well as its Sustainable Development Goals. Romania has assumed the necessary development policies with real impact on advancing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We have chosen to involve in this process all political actors, the civil society, the private sector, and the scientific community. To share our experience in Coordinating the national process of implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to speak about our progress, Romania will Submit its Voluntary National Review during the High Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development in July 201.8.
Ladies and Gentlemen, We cannot lose sight of the stabilizing role the United Nations is playing in setting the broad parameters of contemporary international relations. That is why our effort to improve the effectiveness of the UN should remain strong. At the end of the day, no matter how a future reformed Security Council will look like, we need a UN with robust policy planning capabilities, able to project visions for the global peace and well-being beyond the crises of the day. Romania supports the Secretary General's focus on the creation of an integrated institutional structure for supporting a holistic approach to crisis management. We also strongly advocate for modernizing and increasing the effectiveness of peace operations.

We support the Secretary General in his efforts to pursue a meaningful reform on three priorities: conflict prevention; sustainable development; management reform and reshaping the Secretariat for making the UN more efficient. My country also welcomes the reform of the United Nations counter-terrorism architecture and the UN demarches of making counter-terrorism a key element of its prevention agenda. As no country can fight alone this terrible scourge, we trust that the newly established UN Office of Counter-Terrorism wili increase our efficiency in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In this respect, Romania remains committed to the common initiative developed with Spain for the future possible establishment of an International Court against Terrorism. We also expect an increased contribution of the UN to the global efforts in the area of international migration, including in addressing its main sources. We hope for a consistent follow-up to the New York Declaration of 2016. It is important, in my view, that the Global Compact for Migration, whose negotiations will start soon, covers all dimensions of international migration, to the benefit of both migrants and host communities. We also support the reinforcement of the human rights dimension within all relevant sectors of the UN activity. That is why I welcome the Secretary General's Upfront Initiative on Human Rights, aiming at mainstreaming the human rights policies throughout the UN system.
Ladies and gentlemen, I had the pleasure to organize, earlier today, a debate on a very important topic: Making Education for Peace. The use of identity ""fears"" and of the ""us versus them"" paradigm cannot be left unanswered. In a context of increasing violence and disinformation, Romania is convinced that only through quality education we can counter extremist trends which our youth is facing today.

At the same time, we continue to be concerned with the security developments in and around our region. The belt of protracted conflicts around the Black Sea remains a serious threat. We are still witnessing actions undertaken at the expense of the principles and norms of international law. This proliferation of protracted conflicts in our neighbourhood hampered regional cooperation and brought mutual confidence to historically low levels. That is why the international community should actively support and stimulate regional cooperation, confidence-building measures and address decisively these conflicts.
Romania has constantly flagged the need of strengthening cooperation of the UN with regional and sub-regional organizations. To this purpose, we promoted a first Resolution in this respect, in our capacity of non-permanent member of the Security Council, in 2005.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Romania would be proud to bring its contribution, once more, to the work of the Security Council.
Our bid for a non-permanent seat during the tenure of 2020-2021 is about my country's sincere engagement in supporting the UN efforts for peace and security. It is about our enduring commitment to peace, development and justice. I am convinced that Romania's solid track record of building trust within the UN could bring a valuable contribution to the Security Council. Our dedicated work in the 4 previous mandates speaks clearly about the intensity of our commitment and represents a wealth of experience. Romania is honoured to have been serving in UN peacekeeping missions for more than 26 years, with mole than 10.000 Romanian Blue Helmets, men and women. Romanian military, as well as police and gendarmerie officers have operated and are currently operating in over 20 missions around the world, from Pakistan and Mall to Angola and Haiti. There are also other relevant contributions of my country to UN efforts: We host in Romania the Centre of Excellence for Protection and Security - for training the UN Security personnel, and the Emergency Transit Centre for refugees, managed together with UNHCR and the International Organisation of Migration - the first such body in the world.

If our endeavour to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the term 2020-2021 is successful, we will be honoured to work even harder for the advancement of our common projects and of the Organization as a whole.
Thank you very much!"
Russian_Federation,"Distinguished Mr. President,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Last December, the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on ""Promotion of a democratic and equitable international order"", which clearly stipulated the inadmissibility of interference into internal affairs of sovereign States, non-recognition of coups d'tat as a method of change of power and the need to exclude from the international communication the attempts of unlawful pressure of certain States on others, including exterritorial application of national jurisdiction.
The prevailing majority of Member States of this Organization voted in favor of this resolution. The countries that, despite the goals and principles of the UN Charter, are trying to dominate in global affairs and impose models of development, as well as their own 'values' on States and peoples, guided by the logic of unipolarity that undermines the international law, turned out to be outvoted.
Nevertheless, the world keeps changing. It is gratifying to note, as the U.S. president Donald Trump unequivocally stated from this podium last Tuesday, that:it is important to comply with the principles of sovereignty in the international affairs; it is necessary to ensure leadership by example and not impose one's will on other nations; the countries with different values, cultural patterns and aspirations can not only coexist, but also work hand in hand on the basis of mutual respect. I believe that anyone can sign under these words, especially, if the U.S. foreign policy is conducted precisely on this basis.
Sovereignty, refraining from interference into internal affairs, equality of people and mutual respect  Russia has always adhered to these principles and will continue to uphold them. For the last quarter of a century, Russia, no matter the challenges it faced, made in good faith its part of the way to eliminate the legacy of the Cold War, has done a lot to strengthen confidence and mutual understanding in the Euro-Atlantic region and the world. This, however, has not been reciprocated by our Western partners, overexcited by the illusion of the 'end of history' and still trying to accommodate

rudimentary institutions of block-to-block confrontation era to the modern day realities. NATO aspires to recreate the Cold War climate and refuses to bring to life the principle of equal and indivisible security across the OSCE area, solemnly declared in the 1990s.
The West structured its policy according to the principle of ""who's not with us is against us"", having chosen the path of reckless eastward NATO expansion and provoking instability in the post-Soviet space and encouraging anti-Russian sentiments. This policy is precisely the root cause of the protracted conflict in South-Eastern Ukraine. Despite the efforts being undertaken in the Normandy format and the Contact Group, Kyev invents more and more tricks to bog down the implementation of its obligations on implementing the Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015, endorsed by the UN Security Council.
But even under those circumstances Russia is aiming at constructive work and the search for mutually acceptable ways to implement the Minsk agreements. In response to the expressed concerns regarding the current state of affairs in the field of security, President Vladimir Putin launched an initiative to establish the UN Mission for the protection of OSCE observers in Donbass. A relevant draft resolution has been tabled in the UN Security Council. We hope that the Russian proposal will facilitate the settlement of the internal Ukrainian crisis that broke out as a result of the anti-constitutional coup perpetrated by the ultra-radicals. We are looking forward to constructive interaction on those issues with our European and US partners, without zero-sum games.
Being here, at the UN headquarters, we must not forget about the origins of the United Nations. The rulings of the Nuremberg Tribunal served as a warning against leaving in oblivion the lessons of World War II and the disastrous consequences of the attempts to rule the destinies of the world by trampling lawful interests of other nations and peoples. It is an outrage to use one's concern for freedom of expression as an excuse to condone radical movements that profess neo-Nazi ideology and stand up for heroization of Nazis and their associates. Consistent efforts are required to put a secure shield against neo Nazism, revanchism, extremism and xenophobia, and enhance international and intercultural harmony.
By instigating hatred and intolerance, terrorists, extremists and nationalists destroy and desecrate the objects of historic, religious and cultural value. Civilized Europe tolerates the demolition of monuments to the liberators of the continent and heroes of WWII whose victory laid the foundation of the United Nations. We deem it necessary to pay without delay a priority attention to this issue at the UN General Assembly and UNESCO in order to provide for corresponding legal framework to prevent of such actions. Russia intends to submit relevant proposals.

It is inadmissible to remain indifferent to either the shameful phenomenon of non citizenship persisting in Europe, or the suppression of minority languages in violation of the Conventions of the Council of Europe.
Throughout the ages, world history has proved that the lasting settlement of disputes is possible only through dialogue and finding the balance between basic interests of conflicting parties. Unfortunately, blatant pressure, instead of diplomacy, is more and more prevailing in the arsenal of a number of Western countries. The application of unilateral sanctions, above those introduced by the UN Security Council, is illegitimate and undermines the collective nature of international efforts. Today, the world is watching with alarm as the U.S. imposes yet a new set of restrictions against Iran which, on top of all, are exterritorial in nature and threaten the realization of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that became one of the key factors of international and regional stability.
The faultiness of unilateral sanctions policy has been long proven by the example of more than half a century of the U.S. blockade of Cuba, the immediate lift of which for decades has been called for by almost all the UN Member States. It's time to listen to these calls.
The confrontation around the DPRK is unfolding dangerously. We resolutely condemn the nuclear missile adventures of Pyongyang in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. However, the buildup of military hysteria is not only dead-end but also deadly. It goes without saying that all the UN Security Council resolutions must be implemented. But all of them, along with sanctions, contain provisions on the need to resume talks. We launch an appeal to stop blocking these provisions. There is no alternative to the political and diplomatic methods of addressing the nuclear problem of the Korean Peninsula based on dialogue among all interested parties. We call on responsible members of international community to support the Russia-China roadmap contained in the joint statement of 4 July, made by the Foreign Ministries of Russia and China.
Instigation to turmoil and threats of power interference for the sake of the so-called democratization of Venezuela or actions to undermine the legitimate government of any country are inadmissible. In any internal conflicts the international community must encourage the parties to national reconciliation and compromise.
The attempts to ignore differing opinions, to recur to dictate and ultimatums or the use of force in circumvention of the UN Charter have never done any good. The outburst of international terrorism, millions of refugees, unprecedented flows of illegal migration are mainly rooted in the adventurous change of ""unsuitable regimes"" of the recent years, including armed interventions that brought havoc and destruction in the Middle East

and Northern Africa and paved the way for terrorists in all the parts of the world where they have never been before.
Despite the fact that ISIL is pulling back in Syria and Iraq, considerable additional effort is required to stabilize the region. It should be recalled that it is necessary to fight not only ISIL, but also al-Nusra, the latter being tolerated for whatever reason by the U.S. coalition members.
The developments in Syria give grounds for cautious optimism. The 6th International Meeting on Syria in Astana, held on 14-15 September 2017, has finalized the work on the four de-escalation zones agreed upon with the participation of Russia, Iran, Turkey, the U.S., Jordan and the UN and supported by many other countries. These agreements have created conditions for further progress towards the implementation of Resolution 2254 on the basis of direct dialogue between the government and the opposition aimed at joining their efforts to eliminate as soon as possible the terrorist hotbed and restore peace all over the country, and its unity, and resolve acute humanitarian problems.
The most urgent task is to increase the supplies of humanitarian aid and demine the liberated territories. We are convinced that all those who sincerely wish peace to Syria and its people must join their efforts in this process under the leadership of the UN, and without any preconditions.
The cases of use of chemical weapons in the region are a separate issue. All these cases must be investigated honestly and professionally, without any attempts to manipulate OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism.
The solving of humanitarian tasks and reconciliation of conflicting parties are also relevant for other crises in the region, including the situation in Libya, Yemen, and Iraq. In all these situations, just like in any other conflicts, Russia pursues a balanced policy and works with all parties without exception.
Speaking of the Middle East and North Africa regional issues, we cannot put aside or forget the UN decisions on the Palestinian problem and the Arab Peace Initiative. We attach great importance to the restoration of the Palestinian Unity and welcome the efforts of Egypt in this direction. Russia is ready to assist in any way possible was the resumption of direct talks between Israel and Palestine, and cooperate with Quartet partners and Arab League for this purpose. The unresolved Palestinian problem continues to be exploited by the extremists who recruit more and more adept.
The never-ending bloody terrorist attacks around the world illustrate the illusory nature of the attempts to create 'isolated safe havens'. Extremism and terrorism can only be fought jointly, without double standards or hidden agendas, and relying on the main responsibility of States, as envisaged in the UN Global Counter-terrorism Strategy.

We welcome the reform of counter-terrorism activity of the UN system, initiated by Secretary-General and approved by the General Assembly. We view the appointment of Russia's representative as head of the new UN Office of Counter-Terrorism as the recognition of Russia's role in combating this evil. We thank everybody for their support.
Russia is committed to the goal of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world. Under the existing treaty regimes in the area of arms control and non-proliferation, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons should become the final result of the process of universal and total disarmament ensuring equal and indivisible security. The attempts to 'outlaw' the nuclear weapons without taking into account modern realities and turning a blind eye to all the factors that impact the strategic stability today only make this common goal more distant and undermine the consensus regimes of NPT and CTBT.
We launch an appeal to say `no!' to the militarization of information space. We must prevent the transformation of ICTs into an arena of politico-military confrontation and their use as an instrument of pressure, economic damage, and propaganda of ideas of terrorist and extremist ideology.
The UN must focus its efforts on elaboration of the rules of responsible behavior in the digital sphere that meet the security interests of all states.
Russia has drafted a universal convention on countering cybercrime, including hacking. We propose to open its discussion as early as during the current session.
It is obvious that in the future the world will continue to confront a whole range of new long-term challenges affecting all our civilization. We have no right to waste our energy, time and efforts on geopolitical games. This demands collective rather than unilateral approaches.
The process of shaping the polycentric world order is an objective trend that reflects the redistribution of global balance of forces and increasing the factor of cultural and civilizational identity of peoples. All of us, even those used to bossing the world around, will have to adapt to this reality. It is in our common interests not to try and contain this natural process. The world order should become equitable and democratic, just as the founding fathers of the UN envisioned it. Globalization should not antagonize, but play a unifying role, taking into account the interests of all states without exception and contributing to stable and secure future for all humanity.
Without mutual trust, it is impossible to expect effective implementation of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals or the Paris Climate Agreement, or the solution of global tasks of food security, population, healthcare that are crucial to the developing countries.

The fundamental principles of international relations should include the recognition of political pluralism, freedom of choice and the rule of law. It is necessary to stop relying on military alliances, and provide support and security guarantees to the States that opted for neutrality. As for economy, it is necessary to work on reducing the obstacles to trade and investment, and stop politicizing the economic relations. The international Olympic movement and sports in general should be depoliticized. It is necessary to educate, first of all, the youth, in the spirit of respect for cultural and civilizational diversity of the modern world. We invite everybody to the 19th World Festival of Youth and Students that will be hosted by Russia in Sochi in less than a month. Another major international event held at the same time will be the 137th Inter-parliamentary Union Assembly in Saint Petersburg with its main topic for discussion: ""Strengthening of peace and security through intercultural and inter-religious dialogue"". Let us encourage this dialogue among various cultures and religions, and stop using historic events to instigate hatred and phobias.
The philosophy of coexistence, conjugation and harmonization of interests of various countries is the grounds for President Vladimir Putin's proposed concept of great Eurasian partnership open to all States of Asia and Europe and aimed at the formation of common economic and humanitarian space on the basis of the principle of indivisible security. It goes without saying that equal rights for all, citizens or states, are a universal requirement as stated, as a matter of fact, in the UN Charter.
Indeed, these just and equitable principles are the grounds for the activities of various institutions in which Russia actively participates: Commonwealth of Independent States, Collective Security Treaty Organization, Eurasian Economic Union, Shanghai Cooperation Organization SCO, and BRICS. In the same way, we build our relations with ASEAN, African Union, CELAC, and other associations of Asian, African and Latin American countries. Through joint efforts we achieve a more balanced approach in the work of such institutions as the G-20, APEC, IMF, and IBRD.
We believe in the vitality of this Organization, and would like that the Secretary-General play an active role in facilitating the full realization of its potential based on the goals and principles of the UN Charter and respecting the prerogatives of the UN intergovernmental bodies. A specially tailored approach is required for the ideas of peacekeeping reform where there should be no abrupt shifts or abandonment of invaluable experience accumulated over the decades.
Two millennia ago, the Roman philosopher Seneca (in his Moral letters to Lucilius) wrote: ""We are born to live together"". The UN founding fathers came closest to the realization of this fact. They were convinced (as they enshrined in the UN Charter) that God-given coexistence on one planet must compel all of us to unite in order to prevent the scourge of new wars. To be able to do it today we need to revive the culture of dialogue, search

for the balance of interests against the instincts of instant solutions and the desire to ""punish the disobedient"". In essence, it is a matter of preserving humanity in all its wealth and diversity.
Russia has always been and remains open to joint work with all those who show reciprocal readiness to cooperate on the basis of equality. We will continue to uphold these principles in the UN activities the interest of improving global governance and true democratization of international relations."
Rwanda,"Excellencies, Heads of State and Government  Excellency, President of the General Assembly  Distinguished Delegates  Ladies and Gentlemen
Every year, the United Nations channels billions of dollars in humanitarian assistance. It also sets the global agenda on key policy issues, from development, to women's rights, while providing a platform for major international agreements.
These are signs of an organisation that is both relevant, and, in many cases, competent.
And yet there is a sense, that the United Nations is not meeting our needs and expectations.

2/5
In this context, I would like to commend the Secretary General, for the two important initiatives he championed this week, on United Nations reform, and response to sexual exploitation and abuse.
These steps go to the heart of the matter: the deficit of trust and accountability, in the international system.
To be truly effective at delivering a ""decent life for all"", the United Nations must treat all the people it serves with impartiality and respect, and it must be a good steward of the funds entrusted to it.
Abuse and waste are therefore not a mere public relations problem, but an existential threat, which must be tackled head-on.
The Secretary General deserves our full support, to make the United Nations not only effective, but transformational.

3/5
We have the tools and the mandates to address the global challenges of our day, from climate change, to peace-building, to human equality and development.
Where we fall short, is in getting things done.
Institutional reform is not a one-off event, like applying a fresh coat of paint.
The essence of reform, is a mindset of constantly striving to improve performance and delivery, and holding ourselves responsible for shortcomings and results.
In this sense, the reform spirit, that has started to take root in both the United Nations and the African Union, is encouraging, and Rwanda is happy to be associated with both.
This positive momentum also positions the United Nations and the African Union, to work more closely together.

4/5
Concrete steps can be taken on both sides, to improve the quality of coordination and consultation.
The African Union and the United Nations are already good partners in peacekeeping, and Rwanda is proud to have forces serving under both flags. But we can do much more, and do it better.
We also share the common objective, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and Africa's Agenda 2063 targets, as well as continue to enhance women's empowerment.
Closer collaboration will help us bridge the growing digital divide through universal broadband access, which connects our people to networks of knowledge and prosperity.
Canada and Rwanda, together with other stakeholders, are working to raise awareness of the tremendous impact we can have, right away, by ratifying and implementing the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.

5/5
This is among the most important actions that a country can take, to directly tackle climate change, and re-affirm the commitment to the Paris Agreement. Fewer than 15 additional ratifications are needed, in order for the Kigali Amendment to come into force, in 2019.
Mr President, distinguished delegates:
Our world faces difficult challenges, but no more so, than in the past. Working together, in a constructive spirit, we can assure our children, the future they deserve.
I thank you very much, for your kind attention."
Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Colleague Ministers, Heads of Delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen
I bring you greetings from the Government and people of the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.
I wish from the outset to congratulate you Mr. President on your election as Chair of this 72na Session, and to assure you of my delegation's full support as you carry out your duties.
Permit me as well to extend congratulations to His Excellency Peter Thompson, President of the 71st Session of the General Assembly. President Thompson ably steered the deliberations of many pressing matters during this past year. As a representative of Fiji, he proved once again that Small Island Nations continue to make significant contributions to matters of global relevance.
I also extend a warm welcome to Secretary General Guterres as he assumes leadership of this august body. Your Excellency has come to the helm at a critical time in our collective history and we are confident that your competence, coupled with your political and diplomatic experience will enable you to chart the course of this organization towards a sustainable and peaceful future for all. Be assured, Your Excellency of my Government's fullest support and commitment.
My Delegation also expresses appreciation to former Secretary General Ban Ki Moon for his sterling service and wishes him well in his future endeavours.
Mr. President, the world has gathered here in New York at this 72nd General Assembly under the theme: ""Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet"".
The theme is comprehensive, yet simple; concise, yet inclusive, and it encompasses pivotal and pertinent areas for international reflection at this critical juncture in our history.
Sustainable Planet
Mr. President, permit me to begin where the theme ends: Sustainable Planet.
I choose to do so, Mr. President, because of the experience I, and members of our Caribbean civilization had immediately prior to leaving our countries to attend this General Assembly.

In the space of two weeks we braced ourselves for three hurricanes, Irma, Jose and Maria. Two of these, Irma and Maria, descended on our region as Category 5 hurricanes and in the case of Irma the most powerful storm in recorded history in the Atlantic. I pause to reflect that the hurricane season for 2017 is not yet over and the Caribbean will face similar threats each and every year.
In the aftermath we were faced with the tragic destruction of life, property and infrastructure in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, St Bartholemy, St Martin, Sint Maarteri, the British Virgin Islands, the US Virgin Islands, Cuba, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe and Dominica. Irma then made landfall in Florida in the United States where, like Hurricane Harvey before it in Texas and Louisiana, damage and destruction was caused to millions of people.
Mr. President I have highlighted the various countries and territories that suffered the most devastation but my own beloved country of St Kitts and Nevis was not without injury. We too saw damage to our power grid, our roads, our agriculture and fisheries sector and the homes of our people. Indeed on September 19th the day when we should have been celebrating our 34th anniversary of Independence as a Nation, St Kitts and Nevis was locked down under assault from Hurricane Maria.
Mr. President, the carnage in a wide swath of the Caribbean is unimaginable. Lives have been lost; homes and infrastructure destroyed; economies reduced to tatters; years of development wiped out; and in the case of Barbuda an entire island evacuated and rendered uninhabited and uninhabitable for the first time in 300 years.
It is worthy of note, Mr. President, that the carnage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria took but a few days. In just a few days and in many countries a mere few hours, the world had front row seats to the most horrific destruction ever seen in our beloved Caribbean region.
We have in this very Chamber heard the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda speak solemnly to the utter destruction of Barbuda. We have only today, stood in anguished silence, as the Prime Minister of Dominica recounted the near total destruction of his beautiful country and the tragic loss of life. Their first hand accounts, Mr. President, would move even the coldest hearts to tears.
We today extend our deep condolences to our brothers and sisters and continue to keep them in our prayers. But even as we do so Mr. President, we also remember victims of the two horrific earthquakes in Mexico and those in Japan and New Zealand. Our thoughts and prayers are also with these countries.
Mr. President, the time has now come for the world to treat these phenomena not as natural disasters but as the man made disasters that they are. The science is irrefutable. Our oceans continue to get warmer due to our continued abuse of our Planet Earth. Warmer oceans feed and create horrific storms such as Irma and Maria. Now more than ever we bear wimess to the compelling need to support the call for reduction in green

house gas emissions and all other actions and behaviours that aggravate the effects of climate change.
Mr President, climate change for us in the Caribbean is not a matter for academic rumination. The humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Caribbean in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria is stark testimony that climate change is not only real but poses an existential threat to our people, our countries and our civilization.
The world has deliberated and negotiated. We have made commitments and signed multiple agreements, most recently the Paris Agreement. But the time for more urgent, concrete, tangible and collective action is now.
Mr. President it is the most cruel irony of our times that those of us in the Caribbean least responsible for climate change are the ones most disastrously affected by it. We are not major polluters but we bear the brunt of the effects of such pollution. In every sense Mr. President small vulnerable States like Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica and St Kitts and Nevis continue to be asked, by the world, to cash a cheque we did not write.
In order to attain a sustainable planet, those most responsible for climate change through their green house gas emissions and other environmentally harmful practices must shoulder the responsibility of arresting and ameliorating the consequences. We cannot continue to abuse our Planet and expect to remain unscathed. The people of St Kitts and
/
Nevis calls upon the global community to pledge itself to pursuing renewable energy with greater alacrity. We must invest in better and stronger homes and buildings. We must grow our economies to allow us greater financial resilience and flexibility. The people of St Kitts and Nevis and of our Caribbean deserve and demand the same fundamental right to life and the security of our way of life as others anywhere else. I ask the global community to lend their collective voices so that together we"" can create a glorious symphony for change. That change which ensures a sustainable planet for all.
In this regard, I call on the community of Nations to mobilize the necessary resources to ensure the speedy reconstruction of those countries devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Mr. President, my delegation condemns unreservedly the sterile analysis of GDP per capita which has been used by international agencies to tell our small island developing States that we are now middle and high income countries and therefore locked out of accessing developmental assistance or affordable financing. Mr. President, it is a travesty and a tragedy for the world community to witness such destruction caused by forces entirely outside the control of Caribbean Nations and then refuse to allowthose Nations access to the necessary resources to rebuild. There has to be a more sensible and just model which takes into account the special vulnerability of small island States. St Kitts. and Nevis joins others in demanding that a vulnerability index be developed as part of the matrix for accessing developmental assistance. We of the Caribbean already caught in the debt trap cannot after each disaster be forced to borrow commercially at high interest rates to rebuild .destroyed lives. This is and must be a moral imperative for us all in the

wake of the destruction seen in the Caribbean.
And rebuild we must Mr. President. Countries such as Dominica have no safe zones or other geographic areas to which populations can be relocated. A hurricane of the scale of Irma and Maria devastates entire countries. We of the Caribbean are a proud and resilient people. The world must not stand by and allow the evils of climate change to force Caribbean people to become climate refugees. We must rebuild and we require the community of Nations to partner with us in this rebuilding effort.
In the fight against the disastrous effects of climate change allow me to congratulate the work of many international agencies and organizations as well as non governmental actors. My country is especially heartened with the work being undertaken by the Commonwealth and its leadership.
Focusing on People
Mr. President it follows, that if we are to achieve a sustainable planet, it requires an ""all hands on deck"" approach. From the onset, there must be buy in from all stakeholders. No one should be left out and therefore it calls for inclusiveness, unity and appreciating the input and contributions that all can make to achieving the world we
want.
This brings me to the first part of our theme: Focusing on People. There can be no debate that our people are our primary resource. It is no marvel therefore that Governments allocate a large percentage of their budgets to develop their human capital and expend great effort to ensure that they meet the basic needs of their populace. Governments which fail to provide for their people, and who ill-treat, abuse, and oppress their people must be rightly ostracized by the international community.
Mr. President, our world comprises all kinds of people, but I wish to highlight the youth, that sector of all our populations on whom the global community must increase its focus.
I commend the United Nations on its unflinching efforts to draw attention to our youth. Indeed, it was over two decades ago, that the UN General Assembly adopted the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond. Youth constitute 18 percent of the global population. Youth and children together account for nearly 40 percent of the world's population. The youth, Mr. President are not just our future. They are our present. Globally, Governments must do all they can to provide institutions and opportunities for learning and development; create employment as well as to prepare and to steer the youth towards entrepreneurial endeavours.
But Governments cannot do it alone. We therefore use this forum to call upon the business community as well as non-Government agencies and actors provide our youth with viable options and opportunities for gainful employment and social-economic advancement,

Mr. President we cannot speak of attaining the Sustainable Development Goals without a focus on our youths.
Striving for Peace Mr. President, a vital element of a sustainable planet is peace. It behoves us all, Nations great and small to work towards the achievement of this essential universal value.
Regrettably, Mr. President, while in some countries their citizens are forced to engage in a daily struggle for survival braving the scorching sun and bitter cold to labour for less than US$1 per day, other countries are expending billions of dollars on developing weapons of war and mass destruction. Whilst some governments are allocating large sums to secure a future for their women and youth, others are investing in the tools of war. Whilst the budgets alone of some Governments will be inadequate to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, others are using multiple times these budgets on developing nuclear warheads.
Mr. President, in order to attain a sustainable planet, our priorities must be synchronized, harmonized and synergized. Our goal must be preservation and conservation not only of our natural resources, but also of our human resources.
My delegation condemns unreservedly the actions, which have led to heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula and calls on all countries to respect and honour their solemn commitments under international law. We condemn all actions that encourage violence and disrupt peace. There can be no place in today's world for war and violence. We therefore join the international community in demanding diplomacy and dialogue instead Of sabre rattling and war mongering.
St Kitts and Nevis stands proudly with our Caribbean and Latin American neighbours as a Zone of Peace and exhorts all members of the community of nations to expend every effort to create and promote peace.
Decent Life for All
Mr. President, the theme makes a clarion call, not only to strive for peace, but also for a Decent Life for All. No boy, no girl, no man, no woman should be left behind. We must work together to reduce poverty and hunger, promote justice and equality, and ensure our people have access to healthcare and economic opportunity. In this global effort we must be inclusive and each and every country must be allowed to play its part. No one Nation can do it alone. Human suffering anywhere is human suffering everywhere. We must build partnerships and ensure the contribution of all the populations of this our Planet Earth. All must be allowed to sit at the table of brotherhood and contribute to finding lasting solutions to the problems we face.
In this regard, we call on the international community yet again to look at our dear friend Taiwan. This modern country of 23 million people; a country that has had tremendous successes in technology, agriculture, health, and renewable energy. A country which is a

model of peace and security. St Kitts and Nevis has experienced first hand the benefits of partnership with Taiwan. There is much that they can offer and we lose collectively when we seek to isolate and prevent our fellow Nations from having a seat at the international table. St Kitts and Nevis continues its unwavering support for the Government and People of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to be included in the United Nations and other international agencies. There is much we can learn from Taiwan and we can no longer afford to ignore the voices of their 23 million people.
In equal measure we call yet again for the lifting of the over 50 year embargo against our Caribbean sister Cuba. Mr. President the Cuban people are a noble people who have demonstrated their resilience despite insurmountable odds. Their leadership in health and humanitarian assistance to Africa the Caribbean and Latin America is well known. Their people ask only to be given a fair chance to live their lives in dignity and in peace.
Conclusion
In closing Mr. President, I acknowledge that the task ahead of navigating the many complex issues of the international community will not be easy. We however remain a firm believer in collective strength and of collective effort. This journey to a sustainable planet and future for all is attainable.
Throughout history we have achieved more together than we have achieved alone. Whether we are small islands, land locked, mountain, desert, or ice capped States; whether we are superpowers or powerless we are all better, and the United Nations becomes a better organization, when we work together.
Alone we can do little but together we can achieve much.
The challenges we face globally from climate change to refugees to war and violence require urgent action now. The world does not have the luxury of time. We have talked. We have debated. We have postulated and hypothesized. We have studied and analyzed. We must now act.
In this regard Mr. President I can find no more elegant prose than that of American Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr:
""We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the force urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late. This is no time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action"".
Thank you Mr. President."
Saint_Lucia,"Mr. President
Saint Lucia congratulates you on your assumption of the Presidency of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and assures you of the full support and cooperation of our delegation during your tenure.
We thank your predecessor H.E. Ambassador Peter Thompson of Fiji for his able stewardship of this Assembly during the past year.
Mr. President
For Small sland States like my own in the Caribbean region, the promise of the United Nations is being tested today more than ever. The world is experiencing extraordinary change at a breathtaking pace - change that is reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and the very nature of peace and security.
I arrived in New York earlier this week after a tour of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma on islands in the Caribbean and for the entire week I have been engaged in discussions focused on the region's recovery efforts. I have also watched from afar and with a heavy heart, further destruction to my region - with Hurricane Maria's crushing blow to the sister Isle of Dominica - there claiming over 15 lives so far, and saddling that country wit:h hundreds of millions in damage. And in the case of Puerto Rico, leaving that island diminished.
I have also listened in dismay to the silence of many and the weak acknowledgment by others, on the crisis in our region. It has awakened in me the fear that we may be on our own to chart a path forward for our region.
Mr. President
While some continue to doubt and deny the assessments of science, it is impossible to avoid the facts of climate change. In less than a month - Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Cuba, the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, the Dominican Republic, St. Barts, St. Jotm, St. Thomas, the Turks and Caicos, St Maarten, St. Martin, Puerto Rico, Houston and Florida - have all been victim to the ravages of Hurricanes that have left death and carnage in their wake. The impact has been without discrimination, impacting independent and non-independent countries alike.

Let us acknowledge the fact that Small Island Developing States have repeatedly warned the international community that the failure to adequately respond to climate change would betray our children and condemn future generations to certain doom. I daresay that we do not have the luxury to be silent on this front anymore - we must act.
The future is now and the challenges are profound. What is fast becoming the ""new normal"" is the intensification of extreme weather events, which demands from us real solutions in real time. No longer can we depend on old mechanisms with dense bureaucracies that delay or limit a nation's ability to safeguard its citizens during a crisis and slow the rebuilding effort.
I remind all here that Saint Lucia along with most of our sister CARICOM member states are anchored at the heart of hurricane alley, with our people on the front line, and too often the first to endure the ravages of mother natures fury when the storms come off the Atlantic Ocean. Today, as we look to the world for leadership and partnership, we welcome the commitment to a climate change agenda by the leaders of France and China.
The Government and people of Saint Lucia offer their most sincere condolences and whatever support that we can to those in need. The ties that bind our people run deep; the pain of one is the pain of all. We ask that the global community follow this ethos - never forget that we are all in a symbiotic relationship, we should all be our brothers keeper.
Our Nobel Laureate Sir Derek Walcott speaks to the sense of responsibility to one's neighbor that is rooted in our cultural DNA and the imperative of helping that is not duty. This Mr. President was most poignantly exemplified in a message sent through our OECS Heads WhatsApp group by Premier Dr. Orlando Smith of the British Virgin Islands when hurricane Maria was tunneling towards Dominica. Dr. Smith whose own island had already been brutalized by hurricane Irma told Prime Minister Skerrit ""the people of the BVI are in solidarity with the people of Dominica and will assist in any way we can"". Even in our destitution we open our hearts and means.
I pause here to also share our condolences to others in our hemisphere, notably Mexico, who has long been of support to us, but now faces a mounting death toll from earthquakes that have struck thatcountry.
Mr. President,
I stand here and ask that we revisit many of our lofty goals, as we see inequity as the heart of all of our discussions and seek to address it. That all multilateral discussions on

development, on resilience and the sustainable development of our countries - be equitable and just. We must acknowledge that the UN will never succeed when few do well and a growing many do not.  How can we, when the progress we make is fragile and unequal;
How can we when we indulge our differences to the exclusion of the work we must do together;
How can we, when inequity remains the driving force of our international system propelling some forward and leaving too many behind;
How can we, as leaders talk about sustainable development goals when the people of our countries are stuck in a quagmire, every day struggling to survive
Fundamentally, our global reality is an increasingly integrated one. No one is spared the perils of the convulsions in our world. Our economies, natural environment and people are all connected. We in this hemisphere are not impervious to the impact of war and starvation in the Middle East and Africa; of persecution in Asia; and of the rise of nationalistic tendencies in Europe. We are stacked in a global row of dominoes, where a disruptive event in one country begets similar or worse events in neighboring countries, and spreads, impacting us all and testing our social, political and economic systems. We live in a world of imperfect choices - choices between clinging to the old systems that do not serve us, and rethinking new ways to secure a better future. We must not turn away from the hard choices; we must not fear change. Our challenges are real serious and many. We, the United Nations must get better at the policies that strike at the root of the problem and ground our 17 Sustainable Development Goals in one word - equity.
4

I must reiterate a point stated earlier, that in a time where inequity pervades every aspect of our international order, what hope do we have to successfully implement the SDGs when the deck is stacked against many of our people. How do we ensure that every one of our citizens have the most basic needs like food on their place when we struggle from crisis to crisis. I remind us all, that -

o We have not been able to agree on a minimum standard of living for each and every one of our citizens;

o We fail to maintain base standards that provide adequate healthcare, education, housing, security and economic opportunity for every citizen in our countries much less every individual in every country of the world;

This is not a philosophical question as it is the focus on the individual needs of each in our populations, that will allow us to deliver solutions and hope;

o This is what will stem the flow of migration;

This is what will keep our children in school and offer opportunities for them to be productive members of society;

O

That is what will dull the urge that drives some to crime and others into the arms of

groups that foment evil

Equity is the word that comes to mind when I think of and welcome the overhaul of the UN system. Without equity as a foundation, sustainable development goals are dreams that go away when we open our eyes to our constant state of crisis.

Mr. President
I take this moment to assure the Secretary General of my country's support in the necessary effort to reform this institution to address a new era of responsibility.
At the heart of any reform of this nature, we must all - nations large and small play our role to protect the rights of individuals everywhere. In the face of mounting challenges, we must seek the courage and wisdom to act boldly and collectively - to revise outmoded programs that are so glaringly inadequate to the needs of our time.

We have to harness new ideas and technology, and invest in the individuals and the generations that will build our future. We must see more in terms of outcomes as less in terms of bureaucracy. We must come here to make a difference; and be able to return to our homes delivering on the promises that we make. The mobilization of the leadership of the world to come here is all for naught if we don't deliver. We must come here to make a difference and not get carried away by name calling but instead, ground our discourse in common respect and a commitment to deliver to those we lead.
Mr. President
We must understand and acknowledge that when times change, so must we. Our claims to the fidelity to the words of the Charter mean nothing if we do not create new responses to old and new challenges.
We must be the source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, to ensure peace and a decent life for all our citizens on a sustainable planet. This requires the constant advance of the principles our Charter prescribes. The commitments we make to each other must be honoured, thereby strengthening our trust.
Within and beyond this organization, we must look more honestly on how we categorize each other, and how the development and donor community rank us. How can we call a country a middle income one today based on its per capita GDP, when we know that its location means it likely that at some point within a decade or two, it will be impacted by a natural disaster which will bring it and its people to their knees.
It is unconscionable to see our peers have to beg and plead for goodwill and to have to depend on commercial rates to rebuild broken economies - all because the traditional system is so unyielding, archaic in its design, and at times heartless.
This model must to change to one that allows small and developing nations the real opportunity to survive and thrive in an increasingly cold global environment. The model has to change to allow us all the opportunity to build back stronger and more resilient, the infrastructure that can secure our futures and that of our people.
Mr. President
In closing, the people of my region are resilient, we have gone through this before and will go through this again. We are a people and region committed toworking together and rebuild stronger and better. We have come time and time to each other's aid and have provided to each other the scarce resources - truly being our brother's keeper.

We have also been very fortunate to receive support from friends near and far, as we seek to make a better world for those who will follow us. In our case, friendships like those that we have with Taiwan, Cuba and Mexico amongst others, allow us to envision a positive future.
I ask that while we may come from different places, and with different priorities, we must never forget that we share a common future - a future that will only be secure if we meet threats, challenges and opportunities together, with greater cooperation and understanding.
Our generation's task is to engage in a common effort and towards a common purpose to answer the call of our times. Let it be said by our children's children that we were tested and we did not fail, but we delivered to future generations a better world.
We have that obligation to our people and to our world.
Thank you"
Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines,"Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen:
This Organisation was founded amid the still-glowing embers and simmering tensions of global war. In the shadows of widespread death and destruction, the nations of the world united in recognition of the fact that global challenges are only overcome through collective action and international law - not misguided unilateralism or short-sighted self-interest.
That recognition remains as valid today as it did 72 years ago, even as new threats to life and development have joined armed conflict as challenges demanding concerted international response.
Mr. President
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines stands in solidarity with the Government and People of Mexico as they suffer the devastating effects of yet another earthquake.
As I speak to you today, the island of Dominica has been levelled by a direct hit from Hurricane Maria, even as it was still in the midst of its recovery from the widespread devastation wrought by Tropical Storm Erika two years ago. No individual in that country has been spared. A series of hurricanes, Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria, of unprecedented intensity have struck the peoples of our region with unerring accuracy and rapidity.
The States affected are: The United States, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Dominica, Cuba, Saint Kitts and Nevis, The Bahamas, The British Virgin Islands, The U.S. Virgin Islands, Saint Martin and Puerto Rico.
In the space of five weeks, each of these countries and territories has been struck with the force as of a weapon of mass destruction. Hundreds of people are dead. The damage to infrastructure, while still being calculated, is already over $130 billion. This Atlantic Hurricane season is likely to be the most expensive in history. Developmentally, the affected countries will take years, if not decades, to recover from the devastating battering.
Mr. President,
Make no mistake: The death and destruction wrought by this hurricane season are not merely freak weather events or vengeful acts of God. They are the direct result of the acts and/or omissions of man. They are the manifestations of climate change; the symptoms of the prescient predictions made by the overwhelming majority of scientists. Almost every year is hotter than the preceding one. Almost every hurricane season more intense. Almost every storm, drought and flood more destructive than the previous one. Today, it is a barefaced insult to the intelligence and experience of the peoples of island states and coastal areas to call climate change a hoax.
At this point, it is almost clich4 to reaffirm that Small Island Developing States are the most vulnerable to climate change, while contributing the least to the emissions that cause it. But that truism is the foundation of our just, urgent and

unavoidable demand that the nations that have contributed most to climate change similarly do the most to mitigate its effects and assist others in adapting to the dangerous new realities.
Our global community, in the great traditions of the United Nations and in the spirit of the founders of this organisation, came together through hard-fought negotiations to craft the Paris Climate Accord - an ambitious, if imperfect, agreement designed to arrest climate change and assist the most affected. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines views any attempt to disavow the freshly-minted commitments of the Paris Accord as an act of hostility, and we draw a direct, causal connection between any such abdication and the future death and destruction that island states face as the result of increasingly frequent and intense weather events.
Mr. President,
The independent countries of Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Cuba, the Bahamas and Dominica require the special and sustained support of the international community. These countries require immediate and massive assistance in both immediate relief and long-term reconstruction. That assistance must be concessional and free from antiquated notions of per capita GDP. As such, we join other countries in calling for a donors' conference to address the daunting challenges that these countries face. Only together can we recover.
Additionally, the Caribbean territories with special relationships to colonial powers in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands are in desperate need of assistance and with limited options for international cooperation, given their unique political statuses. Despite our small size and limited means, the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have already sent emergency assistance to these territories, as well as technical expertise. We call on both administering powers and potential donors to look past political issues and look instead at the needs of the affected peoples and communities. We call too on the colonial powers to accept fully their responsibility for the recovery and rehabilitation of these territories.
Mr. President,
The rise of climate change as the existential threat of ore"" era has not replaced the persistent peril of armed conflict across the globe. The human suffering in Syria, Yemen and Myanmar demands greater international attention and action. Similarly, the potential threats to international peace and security posed by tensions on the Korean peninsula, among the Gulf States and in the State of Palestine require persistent and prioritised diplomacy.
Diplomacy, though difficult, is always preferable to the alternative. This United Nations was founded and continues to exist on that fundamental premise. Frustration with the pace of negotiation and mediation cannot give way to the intemperate urge to impose quick military fixes on inherently political problems. Nor can it lead to an illogical interpretation of sovereign self-interest that justifies the trampling on the sovereignty of other states.

Sovereignty is not a sword, but a shield. The United Nations is not a forum for measuring whose sovereignty is bigger, or whose military is better equipped to pursue their narrow, short-term, self-interest. We are a community founded instead on the assumption of sovereign equality of all states; rich and poor, large and small. One nation's ability to destroy another does not imbue it with special rights, but rather profound responsibilities, chief among those being restraint. President Roosevelt's realpolitik adage of speaking softly while carrying a big stick -whatever its limitations - cannot be replaced with irresponsibly bellicose sabre-rattling that inches us closer to the types of conflict that this Assembly was created to prevent.
Mr. President,
In that context, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines views with alarm the continued threats against the sovereignty of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. To be sure, the people of Venezuela have endured an extended period of political conflict, which has exacerbated other difficulties in the country. But with illegal street violence dwindling and all political parties committed to upcoming gubernatorial elections, the interventionist option increasingly floated by the United States and an imprudent OAS Secretary-General have no place in a modern Latin America.
Similarly, any threat, expressed or implied, against the sovereignty of the peaceful and noble Cuban people is an anachronistic throwback to Cold War posturing without any logical justification, particularly in light of recent d6tente between the Governments of Cuba and the United States.
Let us be clear: Latin America and the Caribbean is a zone of peace. There is no conflict, there is no challenge, there is no disagreement in our region requiring military intervention in any way, shape or form; be it covert, overt or by proxy. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is resolutely and implacably opposed to any attempt to ferment external interference or interventionist activities against any nation in our hemisphere.
Mr. President,
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was honoured to host the 2017 Caribbean Regional Seminar on Decolonisation, consistent with our responsibilities as one of the many Caribbean and Pacific small island States, and former colonies in Africa and Asia, whose self-determination was achieved under the watchful eye of the United Nations. The ""inconvenient truth"" is that the decolonisation process remains incomplete, and an intensification of effort is essential in achieving the goal of full self-government through the attainment of a legitimate political status option providing for ""absolute political equality."" This principle must be the guiding standard applicable to the small island territories, just as they were the standards to decolonise other former colonies. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains fully seized of this issue and was pleased to play its role in completing the unfinished business of decolonisation through the hosting of this 2017 seminar, and previous seminars in 2011 and 2005.
Mr President,

The issue of United Nations reform has gained momentum in recent months, and justifiably so. As a large and old bureaucracy, the UN has not demonstrated sufficient nimbleness or responsiveness to new and fast-paced modern challenges. However, the areas demanding the most immediate and far-reaching reforms are not budgetary allocations or staffing matters, but rather the political and organizational underpinnings of the most fossilized structures of the UN and the wider international architecture.
The litmus test for any serious talk of UN reform is the reform of the Security Council. Those who pay lip service to reform while ignoring the need for a reformed Council - with expanded permanent membership, special voice for island states, and radically revised working methods - are simply engaging in an exercise of attempting to reduce their financial responsibilities while maintaining an unjustifiable grip on disproportionate and outmoded power arrangements.
Similarly, the lessons of the global economic and financial crisis have yet to be implemented. Our inactivity has produced an extended period of halting and uneven recovery and an iniquitous globalization whose unequal distribution of benefits and burdens is spurring popular backlash worldwide. This General Assembly, and our Economic and Social Council, must squarely and frontally address reforms to our international fmancial architecture, in particular the Bretton Woods Institutions.
For Caribbean states, the issue of declining Correspondent Balking Relationships is a grave and gathering threat to our continued growth and our on-going connections to the global economy. The UN, the G20 and international financial institutions cannot shirk this issue as a private banking matter. It is a developmental threat of the highest priority, and it demands a coordinated, political solution.
Mr. President,
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines applauds your sustained focus on sustainable development. Our Government has located the Sustainable Development Goals at the centre of our national development strategies. In areas of climate change, pollution and biodiversity, we have banned Styrofoam products, banned the hunting of turtles, tightened restrictions on internationally permitted indigenous whaling activity, and implemented new coastal protection regulations. We are investing heavily in geothermal and solar energy, and expect to generate 80% of our energy needs from renewable sources within the next three years.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is also dedicating special funding to technology-based entrepreneurs, improving wages and occupational health legislation and investing in new modern medical facilities.

We have enacted an innovative Zero Hunger trust fund, with targeted interventions against food insecurity and unemployment in vulnerable populations, while simultaneously creating a contingency fund to aid in disaster recovery efforts.
We are serious and committed to the achievement of all of the SDGs by the year 2030.
Nonetheless, as you and the Secretary-General have recognised, achievement of the SDGs requires international cooperation and the cormnitment of new and additional funding. Ours is the only body that can generate and sustain the necessary political will and resources to give life to the ambition of the SDGs. The link between development and peace is well-established; and the link between peace and the United Nations is immutable.
Mr. President,
A substantial part of the backdrop or context of the continuing socio-economic challenges of the nation-states of our Caribbean civilisation is the awful legacy of underdevelopment which European colonialism has bequeathed to us as a consequence of native genocide and African slavery. The international campaign for reparations from the former colonial powers to assist in repairing this malignant legacy is urgent and timely. It deserves the full support of this Assembly particularly within this decade, declared to be focussed on the upliftment of persons of African descent.
Mr. President,
I repeat yet again the necessity and desirability for the responsible authorities in the Dominican Republic and the United Nations to address properly, once and for all, the respective issues of the denial of citizenship for persons of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic and the cholera epidemic which some of the UN troops in Haiti had initiated.
Mr. President,
In the quest for deepening multilateralism, international cooperation, and peace the glaring injustice of the continuing denial ofTaiwan's membership of the special agencies of the United Nations demands correction. The ghosts of a divisive past ought to be laid to rest; Taiwan's legitimate incorporation into the family of nations is long overdue.
Mr. President,
The travails of the people of Palestine arising from the illegal occupation of their lands continue to haunt us globally. This UN General Assembly has repeatedly pronounced in favour of the rights of the Palestinian people but the illegal occupiers backed by a handful of powerful states internationally have continuously thwarted the will of the international community. Peace in the Middle East will continue to be a mirage unless the national rights of the Palestinian people are recognised and upheld in practice.


i

i

i:

Mr. President,
As we speak in this hall today, we seek to amplify the echoes of the visionaries of yesteryear who stood at this podium to give voice to the system of multilateral cooperation and mutual respect that has defined our post-war existence. New challenges may arise, but the solutions are eternal: diplomacy, ambitious action, and respect for the sovereign equality of all member states. Multilateral diplomacy may be messy and imperfect. International law may be frustratingly inconsistent. The path of development maybe beset on all sides by natural and man-made obstacles. But, united, we have always been greater than the sum of our individual parts, and together, there is no challenge too great for the collective wisdom of our great nations and our great institution.
As new challenges confront us, let us hew ever closer to the undeniable strengths of our Assembly.
I thank you."
Samoa,"Mr President, Fellow delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen
Samoa warmly welcomes your assumption of the Presidency of the 72nd session of our General Assembly, at a time when our organization is going through unprecedented volatile and difficult times. We look forward to your leadership so that together we can chart a more safe, predictable and humane pathway in our journey through life's uncharted waters. You can count on Samoa's support as we work in partnership to translate into tangible and measurable achievements the overarching theme of your tenure ""Focusing on People Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable
Planet.""
Your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji demonstrated strong leadership during his successful presidency and we wish him well in his new calling,

Mr. President, Secretary-General Guterres is passionate and committed to turn the United Nations into an efficient and effective organization that is fit for purpose and readily responsive to the needs of the very people it was established to serve in the first place. In working to make the UN's focus more people-centered than about processes, Samoa assures the Secretary-General of its full support.
Mr President This week's annual general debate is the twentieth successive general debate of the General Assembly I have attended and addressed. My continuous participation is a measure of my conviction and my Government's unqualified faith in the value of the United Nations and the endless potential it holds to deal successfully with any issue of diversity and gravity that it is confronted with. The United Nations remains our choice of last resort and hope to provide the political will and the necessary commitment to address our challenges - hence why we want it to remain relevant, adaptable to changing circumstances and respond effectively to the current and emerging challenges facing
our world.
Mr. President, We meet this week against the backdrop of a world plagued with uncertainty and a sense of ebbing hope. We are losing the fight to free our world from poverty, instability and conflict abounds and we are no longer distanced and disconnected from deadly acts of terrorism and the devastation of natural and human-induced disasters. We are living in an environment of risk. Climate change is an existential threat. Allow me to pause and offer our sincere condolences to the governments and peoples of all the countries that have suffered from the recent devastation of hurricanes and earthquakes.

Mr. President, We cannot help but watch with trepidation and uneasiness the global dynamics nudging our world perilously close to a potential catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. As small island Pacific countries, we are no longer protected by our isolation - we are bystanders but with the greatest to lose in the unfolding power drama being played out in the Korean Peninsula. We pray for visionary leadership with sound moral judgment on both sides to ensure we give 'peace a chance'
It explains why I signed yesterday on Samoa's behalf the ""Treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons"". As a signatory to this historic treaty, we wanted to demonstrate unequivocally our aspiration to have a world without nuclear weapons. The conventional narrative that the possession of nuclear weapons will act as deterrent to make the world a safer place to live, is not borne out by the current realities otherwise the developments in the Korean peninsula would not have happened at all. We firmly believe that possessing nuclear weapons and adding new nuclear powers only make our world less safe, less secure and less peaceful - hence the need to rid our world completely of all nuclear weapons. No matter the noble goal for having such arsenals, availing them to the wrong and unprincipled hands is a recipe for doom and mayhem, as people, after all, are human and mere mortals.
But all is not yet lost. The adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants which offers a united approach to address the plight of the world's displaced peoples, the creation of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office aimed at enhancing the Organization's capability to assist Member States in implementing the UN Global Counter Terrorism Strategy and the historic, first ever Treaty banning nuclear weapons, are all positive developments moving
fo rwa rd.

Mr President, Climate change, like other global challenges, cross borders seamlessly. It has no respect for sovereignty and does not discriminate countries between rich or poor. Its dire consequences are real including those who remain in denial.
Climate change is a perpetual priority issue for Samoa and our Pacific region. In our small islands, as witnessed recently, natural catastrophes can decimate an entire country bringing with them great pain and upheaval to peoples' lives as well as set back the national economy for years. And we know this from repeated past experience.
Our islands limited resources and the lack of adaptive capacity makes the burden of rehabilitation a mammoth undertaking. While we applaud the resilience of our people to bounce back from any major natural disaster, the scars of these natural phenomena take years to heal and recover from. And if it's any consolation to our island states, even some of the well-resourced developed countries are still trying to recover and rehabilitate from the impacts of catastrophes which devastated their economies.
Mr President, Samoa remains committed to ongoing efforts to pursue respect for human rights and rule of law and does its part to contribute to this global effort.
A first ever United Nations human rights council expert group at Samoa's nvitationl visited last month to carry out a fact-finding mission to assess the progress made towards eliminating discrimination against women and the protection and promotion of women's rights in the country. Samoa is the first Pacific country to open its doors to this independent mechanism.

Mr President, We continue to place great faith in the rule of law and the vital protection it offers to all States, especially to weak and small countries like mine with no armed force and not affiliated to any military grouping. The International Criminal Court is an important part of the architecture of world peace based on the rule of law and we call for the early activation of the Kampala Amendments. The ICC was represented at the recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting earlier this month in Samoa.
Mr President Terrorism is an offence to humanity and against the core values of the United Nations. For Samoa, I reaffirm our strong support for the relevant Security Council resolutions against terrorism which provide a clear signal of our determination to suppress terrorist activities, including training, international movement and financing. Samoa continues to align its domestic policies and legislation to meet its international obligations to help fight terrorism as well as participate actively in the Pacific regional security initiatives.
In the context of peacekeeping, Samoa's unwavering support for the United Nations Peacekeeping work is underscored by seventeen years of uninterrupted police deployment to serve in missions in Liberia, Sudan, Timor-Leste and South Sudan, Darfur. Small as we are, Samoan police continue to serve side by side with officers from other countries in places that require the intervention of the United Nations. Our commitment is rooted in our firm belief in the role United Nations peacekeeping plays in helping to eliminate the causes of conflict and in bringing about peace and stability. We fully endorse and condemn sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping and this is why we signed the international compact initiative of the Secretary-General to

committing countries to eliminating these heinous acts in peacekeeping.
Mr President, The 2030 Agenda is our framework to put the world onto a path towards a sustainable and resilient future, for people, planet and prosperity. While the 2030 agenda remains high priority on the global agenda, and we see signs of momentum in terms of implementation, much work still needs to be done. The need to accelerate global action and awareness on the SDGs still remains. The adoption of the Pacific regional roadmap for SDGS complements Samoa's roadmap based on an integrated approach for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Samoa Pathway, Paris Agreement and Pacific Framework for Regionalism which are aligned to our national development strategy.
For Small Island Developing States, the SAMOA Pathway is their sustainable development roadmap which highlights their key tasks and priorities and links closely with the 2030 agenda. As we approach the 5 year review of the SAMOA Pathway in 2019, it is important to ensure that the comprehensive review of the UN support to SIDS is properly addressed and implemented. We need to study closely lessons learnt from the Partnerships registered for SIDS and encourage proactive follow up as well as pursue new partnerships for the group's sustainable development.
Several partnerships and Voluntary commitments specific to SIDS were launched during the Ocean Conference since the last annual SIDS Partnership dialogue. Prior to the mid-term review of the SIDS outcome document it is important to look at ways to improve implementation and addressing the gaps and emerging issues.

The success of the Ocean Conference was crucial to building momentum of SDG implementation given that the Ocean is the lifeblood of the planet. Addressing the targets of SDG14 for SIDS is catalytic to implementing several, if not all of the17 Goals.
With the new Blue Pacific concept for the Pacific region, and the concrete outcomes from the Conference, emphasis is to be placed on implementation. Samoa at the Ocean's Conference pledged 13 Voluntary Commitments that showcased national efforts towards the conservation management and sustainable use of the Ocean and its resources and engagement of communities.
During the Ocean Conference in June, I was appointed the Special Ambassador of the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development by UN World Tourism Organization. 2017 is a crucial year for sustainable tourism and given the reliance of many of our small economies on tourism, and the role it can play in SDG implementation; we will continue to promote the role of Tourism in support of peaceful societies and sustainable development
Mr President, Let me now turn to the regional context and share with you some of the decisions taken by the Leaders of our Pacific Islands Forum at their Summit which my country was privileged to host at the beginning of this month. We chose as the theme for our year-long chairmanship ""The Blue Pacific: Our sea of islands: Our security through sustainable development, management and conservation"".
In Samoa, we re-armed the Framework for Pacific Regionalism to drive our region's policy agenda towards the realization of our vision for a region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and

prosperity so that all Pacific people can lead free, healthy and productive lives,
We also endorsed The Blue Pacific identity as the core driver of collective action for advancing the Leaders vision under the Framework for Pacific Regionalism. This new narrative calls for inspired leadership and a long-term Pacific Islands Forum foreign policy commitment to act as one for the good of all, rather than a few. The Blue Pacific identity reinforces the potential of our shared stewardship of the Pacific Ocean, based on the explicit recognition of our shared ocean identity, ocean geography, and ocean resources. It aims to strengthen collective action by putting The Blue Pacific at the centre of regional policy making and united action for advancing the Forum Leaders' Vision for the Region.
With other Pacific Leaders, we discussed the key priorities for our region; a few of which I will highlight as their implementation requires collective and urgent action from this august gathering of the United Nations.
Mr President, Firstly, climate change remains a priority challenge for the Pacific region because of its existential nature and its security implications. Climate change is already happening; it cannot be washed away by the rising tides. It has significant security implications and its impact threatens the continued existence and viability as sovereign states of some of our low lying atolls. Even those countries, which have been in self-denial to date of the climate change phenomenon must surely now accept the weight of scientific evidence.
The implementation of the Paris Agreement is of high priority requiring collective action to address this existential threat. We are confident that Fiji's presidency of the November COP23 will focus the spotlight

challenges and the need for genuine partnerships to help us deliver on our ""nationally determined contributions"" as part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Pacific has also endorsed its Framework for Resilience Development as well as its institutional arrangements to support the elaboration and implementation of the Paris agreement
Secondly, the ocean and its resources continue to be critical to the livelihoods of our people and region. The impacts of Climate Change, Illegal Unregulated Unreported fishing and overfishing are threatening the sustainability of this crucial resource of our region. The Pacific Forum members will continue to be actively engaged on all Ocean related issues of the 72nd session of the GA including the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction process
Thirdly, we adopted the ""Pacific Roadmap for Sustainable Development"" and its implementation strategy. This demonstrates the seriousness our region places on implementing the 17 SDGs and the importance of a regional approach to meeting these international commitments. We continue to count on the important role of the UN and our partners to support regional and national efforts for SDG implementation particularly the building of our capabilities. We look forward to the Secretary General's reform and how the Forum can engage to ensure its priorities in terms of its SDG roadmap and the implementation of the SAMOA Pathway, Paris Agreement and other regional needs are considered in the reform.
And finally in the context of security, the Pacific Islands Forum remains committed to collective arrangements and mechanisms to assist regional governments recover from national conflicts and crises. The success of these arrangements together with the support of the UN, are already evident in the positive results of the Regional Assistance

Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). I am honoured to acknowledge the successful conclusion of the Regional Assistance Mission in the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) which brought together peacekeepers from all members countries of the Pacific Islands Forum.
Leaders acknowledged the successful conclusion of RAMSI and recognized it as a success story of regionalism and a workable example of regional cooperation and diplomacy, embodying more than a decade of partnership and cooperation amongst Forum members.
Leaders agreed to build on the Biketawa Declaration and other Forum security related declarations to expand the concept of security, inclusive of human security, humanitarian assistance, prioritising environmental security, and regional cooperation in building resilience to disasters and climate change.
The Pacific over the years continues to call for advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation. Issues such as radioactive contaminants in the Republic of the Marshall Islands are of great concern to RMI and the region. We count on the promised support of the relevant UN entities to respond accordingly to requests for assistance including working closely with the regional technical agencies. The US is also encouraged to take urgent action to address the issue.
Thank you."
San_Marino,"Mr. President, Mr. SecretatT-General, Excdlencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
On behalf of tee Government of the Republic of San Marino, I would like to congratulate H.E. Mkoslav Lajek on his dection as President of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly and to wish him a fruitful work. His experimce as Minister of For.eign Affairs of Slovakia and los deep kmowledge of hxtemational afs ae valuable resoLces for the United Nations. The San Marino delegation will ensure you, Me. President, its utmost colaborat-km dui:ing all works of the General Assembly.
At the beginning of his mandate as SecretalT-General of the United Nations, my countU would also like to offer heartfelt wishes to H.E. Ant6nio Guterres and thank him for the energy and determination akeady shown at the hehn of the United Nations in these first months of activiW,'
Mr. President,
i am grateful for the theme chosen for this Session: ""Focusing on people: str.ivh:g for peace and a decmt life for al! on a sustainable planet"", where issues so dear to the Republic of San Marino such as human rights, peace and sustainable development are at the centre of the agenda. This is a cross-cutting issue, since human rights are reflected in any action of the United Nations aimed at achieving peace, security, justice and sustainable development. The intematkmal comm.uni, must do its utmost to achieve these objectives in the coming years.
Mr. President,
In eveU situation of armed conflict, we are wimessing with dismay a systematic violation of human rights. Refugees and migrants are subject to discrhaination and to forms of abuse and trafficldng,
Racial and religious discrimination and intolerance persist in many parts of the worM. Inequality and social exclusion are at thebasis of the numerous and increasingly complex challenges that the United Nations is called to face.
In recent yeas, unfortunately, we have wimessed a growth of inequality and margJImlizatiotl not only in developing counties but also in the richest ones, where increasingly large sections of the population have to snuggle against growing poverty'.

This is a threat to global stability, since it lcads to an erosion of confidence in national and multilateral institutions and, in parallel, it contributes to fuelling nationalist and populist movements.
Collective commitment to human rights is therefore essential. The relationship between peace, security and respect for human rights is undeniable: the measures for the protection and promotion of human tights are essential to prevent conflicts and to support peace. Moreover, peace and sustainable development are vo complementary concepts: more inclusive and peaceful societies set the conditions for sustainable development and vice
versa.
Mr. President,
The complexi, level of the challenges that the United Nations is called to face today is unparalleled in the histoU of this Organization. The interconnected nature of the challenges reminds us that countries must act together to be more effective in the fight against climate change, global terrorism, poverty and to build more inclusive, safe and just societies for all.
As stated by the Secretary General in his report on the works of the Organization, it is important to bolster confidence in multilateralism and in particular in the United Nations. Ou counttT has ;dways believed in the power of dialogue and respect for others, values which underpin the peaceful coexistence among peoples.
Its profoundly egalitarian nature, universal participation and unquestioned legitimacy unequivocally reaffirm the value and the central role of fle United Nations as a forum for solving global problems.
The many and varied religious and cul0,,tal traditions present in our Organization must not be an obstacle, but rather a valJaable resource to achieve global solutions through a synthesis and mediation of diversities.
The Umted Nations must adapt quicMy to the new globa! challenges, but also to the new opportunities offered by an increasingly interconnected world, in order to be more effective in carlTing out its mandate.
Therefore, reforms are crucial to future world stability and t=aintenance of international peace and security, and must remain at the centre of our actions. We reject any downsizing of the role of the United Nations due to the impossibility of finding a common agreement on the }eforms needed to improve its functioning.

The Republic of San Marino is following with interest the revitalization process of the UN General Assembly, which must continue to be a reference point, a forum for the exchange of ideas and for conducting discussions, in which solutions based on a strong consensus may be achieved.
Shnilarly, the Security, Council reform should be an objective of all member States. As we have stated on previous occasions, our country believes that intergovernmental negotiations favour the search for an agreement based on a broad and strong political consensus, able to reflect the interests of all negotiating groups. San Marino calls for a reform that makes the Council more democratic, transparent, efficient and accountable. This goal can be achieved only through a continuous dialogu.e among the States and the awareness that overcoming the respective initial positions is essential to negotiate the broadest agreement possible.
The Republic of San Marino supports the SecretaD"" General's reform agenda, aimed at streamlinhg procedures, decentralizing decision-malting processes and achieving greater transparency and account,ability.
Mr. President,
Human rights are the raison d'etre Of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and of the 17 Sustainable DeveIopment Goals.
The Agenda defines our future and the vision of a peaceful, inclusive and safe society, where the burden of poverty has been elhwinated, prosperity is shared and a decent work may be offered to all.
It also reflects, together with the Paris Agreement on climate change, the member States' ambition and commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, thus giving to our planet and its inhabitants the possibility of living longer and in better condition.
The Agenda is ambitious because it is universal, integrates the three dimensions of sustainable development (social, economic and environmental) and applies to all States.
A year after the adoption of the sustainable development goals, their effective Lmplementation is today's real challenge. In many areas covered by the 2030 Agenda, unforttmately progress is not in line with expectations.
Much more needs to be done for the 700 million people living in extr.eme poverty and experiencing malnutrition. More targeted actions should be implemented to reduce maternal mortality and gender inequality', to ensure an inclusive and just education, to invest in sustainable energy and to provide healthcare to wider segments of the population.

The implementation of the 2030 Agenda is the responsibility of individual States, which should keep faith to their promises by incorporating sustainable devdopment objectives into thek development laws and polities.
A culttal revolution must accompany our policies in the coming years. In the Republic o San Marhlo, for instance, we have promoted initiatives concerning education for sustainable development in various sectors, such as education, construction, waste disposal and public transport.
Not only national Governments but also the ptivate sector and civil sociew play an important role in mobilizing the resources necessary for the im.plementation of dae Agenda. In this regard, San Marino recalls the important result achieved with the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which identifies various concrete measures to finance devdopment and lays the foundations of the global program of the Agenda.
Mr. President,
The 2030 Agenda states that' the rights of the most vulnerable people must be promoted and protected, The Republic of San Marino has always paid special attention to the most vulnerable groups, such as women, children, the elderly and the disabled.
San Marino, which is among the ftrst signatoU count, ies of the Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, intends to fully implement the Convention by adoptkag legislative frameworks and policies that favour the inclusion and full participation of people with disabilities in de country's working, social and cultural context.
Gender equalit?, must be a goal of the international conu-nunity. Unh)rmnately, women are still the victims of discrimination and violence in maW parts of the world, also in the most developed countries.
In support of the initiatives promoted by the Secretary-General, San Marino sig-ned the Compact to combat and prevent sexual abuse and exploitation in the context of Utaited Nations peacekeeping missions. We believe that the rights and dignity of the victims of sexual abuse should be placed at the heart of our collective efforts.
Children are unfortunately the most vulnerable victims of violence, abuse mad exploitation and the protection of their rights must be at the centre of out actions. San Matino supports the Ministerial Declaration of this year's High-Level Political Forum, wllich reaffttTned the commitment of the international con-mmnity ha favour of children, focusing in particttlar on
4

5
poverty eradication, the promotion o their participation and the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination.
Mr. President,
Re:fugees and migrants continue to be the subject of a violent discrimination. The enormous humanitarian challenge posed by large movements of refugees and migrants can be addressed only through greater cooperation and sharing of responsibilities and costs among aH States. This phenomenon has reached an unprecedented dimension in the lstory of the United Nations.
The Republic of San Marin.o supports the New York Declaration for refugees and migrants, adopted last September. It contains a series of bold commitments to address the challenges posed by the large flows of migrants and refugees, but it also intends to develop a plan for their implementation.
Similarly to the large movements of refugees and reign:ants; the United Nations is also called to face deep and complex humanitarian crises. As indicated in the Secretary G.ermrai's report on the activity of the Organization, in 2017 about 96 million people, more than half of which were women and children, received hmnanitarian assistance in more than 40 countries. The report shoves that in 2016 natural disasters caused the displacement of about 31 million people, three times more than those forced to flee because of armed conflicts. An unprecedented food crisis invoNes more than 20 million people in the African continent.
The Republic of San Marino has always supported the development cooperation projects and urgent interventions also through numerous international organizations, especially of the UN fany.
Our countt3., is grateful to the UN Secretary, Genera! for the rapid and fundamental action in favour of de populations facing humanitarian emergencies and to OCHA and CERF for their rapid response and substantial contribution.
Mr. President,
Today, the United Nations has recorded the largest deployment of peacekeeping operations (16) and special political missions (36).
The recent wars and those still ongoing have caused great sufferi*g to civilians, an unprecedented global hmnanitarian crisis, the tragedy of the great movements of migrants and refugees, as wel! as an increase of terrorism and violent extremism, of populism and intolerance.

Despite the negotiations for a politica! solution in Syria, which were resumed last January under the auspices of the United Nations, facitated by the Special Envoy of the SecretaUGeneral, to whom the Republic of San Marino gives its full support, the situation remains highly unceictakl, thus causing a massive displacement of civilians and at the same time posing a threat to the stability o the entire region.
Mr. President,
The Republic of San Marino supports the Secretary, General in his initiative ahned at strengthening prevention activities and conflict mediation. In this regard, my country will participate in the Italian initiative for the creation of a network of women mediators in the Mediterranean area, whose purpose is to contribute to peace processes through prevention and mediation.
The Umted Nations must be able to address in advance the causes of a possible conflict, by establishing relations with the various national or regional stakeholders and working to achieve sustainable peace,
More and more frequently, terrorism and violent extremism are generated and fed by armed conflicts and exacerbate ethnic, religious, political and economic tensions.
Violations of human rights by terrorist groups such as ISIL, A1-Qaeda and Boko Haram e very serious and include murder, kidnapping, forced conversion, human trafficking, slaveu, sexual abuse, as weU as destruction of places that have a religious or a culturd meaning for ethnic and religions minorities.
The self-proclaimed Islamic State and its associated forces are also responsible for numerous deadly terrorist attacks in Europe, Asia and Africa. The hternarional communit), and the United Nations must act so that those responsible for these heinous crimes are prosecuted. San Marino supports the activities and initiatives of the United Nations in the promotion of justice and the rule of law, Which form an integral part of the protection and pmmodon of human rights.
My country, welcomes the acdon of the Secretary-General, supported by the General Assembly of the United Nations, for the establishment of an Oqce of Counfer-Terroism, headed by a Deputy Secretary-General, in order toenhance coherent action by the United Nations and provide better assistance to member States in their fight against terrorism.
The disarmament activity plays a cruciaI role for peace and international security. The recent tests carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the context of a program

to build nuclear weaPons threaten security not only regionally, but also globalty and stress the need for a robust disarmament and non-prolifecation policy.
The Republic of San Marino took part in the negolations that led to the adoption of the Teaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons last July. The Treaty is an hportant step to achieve the corrunon goal of a world without nuclear weapons.
Mr. President,
to address the many and complex challenges of today, the United Nations must be more ef-fective and flexible. Member States must assume their responsibilities, including that of making our organization able to fulfil its mandate, which is to protect the citizens of the world.
Thanks to its century-old histo,y of peace and freedom, San Marino is a State with a strong identity. Our State is smalI, but proud to b i:ing its contribution to the United Nations Community:, Everythhxg we do should ahn at restoring the capacity and authoritativeness of the United Nations, so that it can continue to be the indispensable reference point of the klternatJ.onal cotnmunity.
Thank you."
Sao_Tome_and_Principe,"Mister President of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations
Excellency Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Heads of State and Government
Excellencies, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and External Affairs
Distinguished delegates,
Excellencies,
It is with a great honor and satisfaction that I take the floor at the General Assembly, for the first time, as Head of State of the Democratic Republic of So Tom and Principe. The 2016's elections, which elected me, witnessed once again, in an expressive and unequivocal way, the level of democracy in So Tom and Principe and the regular functioning of its institutions.
At the outset, allow me to dedicate, with great pleasure, my first words to His Excellency Miroslav Lajdk, whom ! congratulate on his election to the Presidency of the 72nd General Assembly of the United Nations, conveying our full support for his mandate and wishing that it will be very successful.
I would also like to Congratulate the outgoing President, His Excellency Peter Thomson for the manner in which he conducted the work of the previous General Assembly, judiciously, with enthusiasm and unselfishness, in an international context that has posed serious challenges to our Organization.
I also take the opportunity of such noble audience to address Your Excellency the Secretary General Ant6nio Guterres and congratulate you for your brilliant victory, insofar as your political clout is indisputable to lead

the United Nations and deal with the multiple global challenges, in the pursue of the necessary reform of the Organization, including its Security Council, and the efforts to promote peace, sustainable development and human rights.
Mr. President
The current challenges facing our peoples and countries, in the face of a complex international environment, forces us to deepen the guiding spirit that underscores the creation of our Organization, as the ultimate and global guarantor to seek for peaceful, lasting solutions, consensual and legitimized by international laws, sothat we may attain the desired objectives of peace, security, stability and progress of all Humanity.
As such, this ""is a sovereign occasion, so that together we can continue our reflection, in order to strengthen the role of this Organization.
To that end, it is therefore urgent to carry out essential reforms that respond to the dynamics of today's globalized world, that is, to enable the different specialized agencies, that make up the United Nations, to act swiftly and effectively, in a process which is intended to be inclusive of all nations, as reflected in this important document, such as the Charter of San Francisco, signed on June 26, 1945.
On the other hand, we must reinforce the awareness for the need to implement mechanisms that allow for greater inclusion in decision-making and strategic planning, which are the guiding principles of international finarcial institutions, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
We firmly believe that this is the only way for the economies of developing countries to be able to faster integrate the global development process, whose benefits are not yet fully reflected in our own countries, while allowing for the renewal and strengthening of the credibility of these institutions, which we consider to be of central importance to) the functioning of the global financial system and to support our economic growth efforts aimed at the social and human development of our populations.
Mr. President

The theme proposed for this Session, ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"" fits perfectly into the reality of the moment we live in and aligns with the challenges we face, in search of a better world.
Thus, because the primary focus of any national, regional or international policy is to prioritize the people and their yearnings for a better life, as well as the continuous improvement of the mechanisms needed to meet those goals.
The effort for world peace is urgent and encompasses fundamental values, which we are sure we all stand for and Strive to achieve. The serious conflicts which trouble the world are a constant concern, and its harmful consequences for the well-being of humanity, for the balance of relations between our nations and for our economic, social and human development, cannot but be strongly condemned by all of us without exceptions.
The divisions we are now seeing are, in our view, the result of the lack of a sincere, comprehensive and thoughtful dialogue between all parties. It is not possible to accept that in the name of religious fanaticism, isolationism, populist rhetoric misplaced in our time, I would even say of selfishness in accepting and living with the differences of others, continue to result in so much discord, aggravating tensions and the curtailing of so many lives, among them those of our children who, well cared for, represent the real future of our planet.
Therefore we call for dialogue, emphasizing the central mediating role of our Organization, to cease the tensions on the Korean Peninsula. It is also necessary for weapons to cease in Syria, where people live permanently under the threat of bombs that have destroyed the country and torn its social fabric, while claiming so many innocent lives. There is also a need to accelerate the process of dialogue and concord in the Middle East, to which we once again make the strongest appeal from this podium to find a peaceful and negotiated solution respecting the right of the Palestinian people to conduct their own destiny, thus respecting the basic principles of the United Nations.
Similarly, there is an urgent need to find a solution at the negotiating table for the tensions in Ukraine, the Western Sahara issue and our brother country, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, whom we greet warmly and wish that their institutions regain a rapid and regular functioning.

Even though the recent Ministerial Meeting of the African initiative for Peace and National Reconciliation in the Central African Republic, which took place in the Gabonese Republic on 17 July, has taken a step in the right direction, we have followed with great concern the deterioration of the security situation with incalculable humanitarian consequences, sadly pointing to a situation of genocide, thus our appeal goesfor the need that efforts should be made to avoid another humanitarian disaster in that African country.
Mr. President
We cannot but deplore the terrorist acts that unfortunately keep on claiming out so many lives in the whole world. The barbarity and disrespect for the precious good that is human life, committed through these indescribable acts, appalling and inhumane, Warrant our firmest and vehement condemnation.
In this regard, we underline the atrocities committed by Boko Haram group, among others, in our neighboring and sister country Nigeria, which has been leading to instability in the whole region and a severe slow-down to the implementation of sustainable development policies, with undeniable echo in the deterioration of the safety of the Gulf of Guinea, where maritime piracy acts and illegal activities associated with it have distressed our region.
The Democratic Republic of So Tom6 and Principe as a pacific, democratic and open to dialogue State will always stand side by side with its regional and international partners in all the initiatives that aim at eradicating this phenomenon from our societies.
Mr. President
If, as the theme of this Session invokes us, we really want to create the conditions for people tO lead decent lives, it is urgent to address the problem of migratory crises. Every day we are confronted with the tragedies that are afflicting thousands of people who, escaping conflicts and the conditions of misery that affect their countries, risk, in poor conditions, perishing in trips in precarious circumstances, in search of a better life. There shouldn't be any doubt that no one leaves their homeland, facing these risks, spontaneously.
There is a civic, ethical and moral responsibility to welcome these people, providing them with the indispensable humanitarian assistance, but also to create

the conditions for mitigating this phenomenon inthe countries of origin. This involves the adoption of concerted policies for the reception of refugees, as well as to provide support for countries of origin, to evolve in an environment of peace and stability, providing the necessary conditions for their populations to take part in the life projects they choose.
We also underlined the important work of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, under the shared presidency of Germany and Morocco, which began in January of this year and will run until the end of 2018, whose contributions to the United Nations Global Compact for Migration, we are convinced, will lead to this much-desired policy of improved global migration, to be adopted by the community of States in 2018.
We also welcome the recent French initiative which brought together a European-Africa joint mini-summit held in Paris at the end of August, with the aim of finding ways to overcome Africa's significant migratory flow to Europe, which has transformed the Mediterranean Sea into an authentic cemetery.
I cannot fail to mention the Sustainable Development Goals, whose priorities go directly to the core of what we have been expressing. Eradication of poverty and hunger; the promotion of social and economic development; the protection of the rights of all, gender equality and the empowerment of women; combating climate change; access to quality services and special attention to vulnerable groups. If achieved, as we believe, then .we will be able to see a positive evolution of the living conditions of our nations, so let us all work to that end.
In this regard, we highlight the efforts of the African Union, enshrined in the guidelines of the important and ambitious Agenda 2063, the implementation and success of which will contribute greatly to making these objectives more easily reachable. This is without a doubt an inclusive document, based on the cultural specificities of each country, which consciously demand from our governments a very clear commitment to its success.
Mr. President
As successful as we are atachieving the goals for peace, stability and progress on a world scale, none of this will make any sense if we do not know how to take care of our planet. Combating the phenomenon of climate change is perhaps the most complex objective for which all humanity is called upon to intervene. The

success of this fight is perhaps the greatest legacy we can leave to future generations.
In this context, the Paris Agreement is a historic and broad-based consensus on the challenges we face in this area and the financial and technological means to overcome them. However, the proposed measures are yet to be implemented. Every day we postpone this issue, more of our planet suffers. Increasingly extreme weather events cause irreparable damage to our ecosystem and life on Earth. I thus appeal to your political boldness, without prejudice to the understanding that each one should contribute according to the principles of common equity and responsibilities, while differentiated.
So Tom and Principe, a small developing island state, has spared no effort in this regard and I want to assure you of our firm commitment to be at the forefront of implementing climate change mitigation measures.
However, it should be noted that, along with so many other countries, funding for such measures lacks the support of the international community. Cooperation Agreements should be established with ambitious funding for climate issues, as well as ensuring effective and efficient transfer of technology by the more developed countries.
As you know, our economy is extremely vulnerable, depending on almost 90% of Official Development Assistance. In a context of international financial containment, it becomes necessary to think and design alternative ways of addressing such complexity. It was with this in mind that the current government decided to implement an ambitious transforming agenda for the 2030 horizon, fundamentally aimed at changing the paradigm of growth and economic and social development policies in So Tom and Pr[ncipe, with a strategic focus on the private sector of our economy. This new strategic direction, in what concerns its guidelines, is in perfect harmony with the aspirations of both the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063.
We hold the belief and have the ambition of its success, but we wil! not be able to do it without the strong support of our traditional partners as well as the international community.
In this regard, I would like to remind you that, based on the principle of recognition of ""Ore China"", the Government of the Democratic Republic of So Tom and Principe re-established, at the end of last year, diplomatic ties with the

People's Republic of China, which, we are certain, will contributed to the strengthening of the family of the strategic partners with which we intend to follow the difficult paths of development that we have proposed through our Transformation Agenda by the year 2030.
In supporting also the development efforts of Cuba's friendly people, we wish to renew our call for the efforts to the normalization of their relations with the United States of America so that as soon as possible we can watch the lifting of the embargo which has for decades been an obstacle to the country's progress.
Mr. President
In the era of the proliferation of technological means at the disposal of mankind, our societies, ever more attentive and informed, demand a renewed effort in the accomplishment of the noble mission of our Organization.
Let us therefore seek inspiration in its founding principles, in the quest for the peaceful resolution of conflicts; in humanitarian support to all those who need it; in the promotion of inclusive and constructive dialogue; in the protection of our ecosystem and in the promotion and guarantee of Human Rights, so necessary for the harmonious development of our nations.
The Democratic Republic of %o Tom and Pr[ncipe will continue to fight for such ideals, joining forces and willpowers for its materialization.
Thank you for your attention"
Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations,"Mr. President of the General Assembly, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,
I am here in a spirit of gratitude and humility for the trust you have placed in me to serve the world's peoples.
""We the peoples"", and our United Nations, face grave challenges.
Our world is in trouble. People are hurting and angry. They see insecurity rising, inequality growing, conflict spreading and climate changing.
The global economy is increasingly integrated, but our sense of global community may be disintegrating.
*****

3
Societies are fragmented. Political discourse is polarized. Trust within and among countries is being driven down by those who demonize and divide.
We are a world in pieces. We need to be a world at peace.
And I strongly believe that, together, we can build peace. We can restore trust and create a better world for all.
Excellencies,
I will focus today on seven threats and tests that stand in our way.
*****

4
For each, the dangers are all too clear. Yet for each, if we act as truly united nations, we can find answers.
First, the nuclear peril.
The use of nuclear weapons should be unthinkable. Even the threat of their use can never be condoned. But today global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at the highest level since the end of the Cold War.
The fear is not abstract. Millions of people live under a shadow of dread cast by the provocative nuclear and missile tests of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Within the DPRK itself, such tests do nothing to ease the plight of those who are suffering hunger and severe violations of their human rights.
I condemn those tests unequivocally.
I call on the DPRK and all Member States to comply fully with Security Council resolutions.
Last week's unanimous adoption of resolution 2375 tightens sanctions and sends a clear message regarding the country's international obligations.
I appeal to the Council to maintain its unity.
Only that unity can lead to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and -- as the resolution recognizes -- create an opportunity for diplomatic engagement to resolve the crisis.
*****

6
When tensions rise, so does the chance of miscalculation. Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings.
The solution must be political. This is a time for statesmanship.
We must not sleepwalk our way into war.
More broadly, all countries must show greater commitment to the universal goal of a world without nuclear weapons. The nuclear-weapon states have a special responsibility to lead.
Today proliferation is creating unimaginable danger, and disarmament is paralyzed.
*****

7
There is an urgent need to prevent proliferation, to promote disarmament and to preserve gains made in these directions.
These goals are linked. Progress on one will generate progress on the other.
Excellencies,
Second, let me turn to the global threat of terrorism.
Nothing justifies terrorism -- no cause, no grievance.
Terrorism continues to take a rising toll of death and devastation.
It is destroying societies, destabilizing regions and diverting energy from more productive pursuits.
*****

8
National and multilateral counter-terrorism efforts have disrupted networks, reclaimed territory, prevented attacks and saved lives.
We need to intensify this work. Stronger international cooperation remains crucial.
I am grateful to the General Assembly for approving one of my first reform initiatives: the establishment of the UN Office on Counter-Terrorism.
Next year, I intend to convene the first-ever gathering of heads of counter-terrorism agencies of Member States to forge a new International CounterTerrorism Partnership.
But it is not enough to fight terrorists on the battlefield or to deny them funds.
*****

9
We must do more to address the roots of radicalization, including real and perceived injustices and high levels of unemployment and grievance among young people.
Political, religious and community leaders have a duty to stand up against hatred and serve as models of tolerance and moderation.
Together, we need to make full use of UN instruments, and expand our efforts to support survivors.
Experience has also shown that harsh crackdowns and heavy-handed approaches are counterproductive.
As soon as we believe that violations of human rights and democratic freedoms are necessary to win the fight, we have lost the war.
*****

10
Excellencies, Third, unresolved conflicts and systematic violations of international humanitarian law.
We are all shocked by the dramatic escalation of sectarian tensions in Myanmar's Rakhine State. A vicious cycle of persecution, discrimination, radicalization and violent repression has led more than 400,000 desperate people to flee, putting regional stability at risk.
I take note of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi's address today  and her intention to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State chaired by Kofi Annan within the shortest time possible.
Let me emphasize again: The authorities in Myanmar must end the military operations, allow unhindered humanitarian access and recognize the right of refugees to return in safety and dignity. They must also address the grievances of the Rohingya, whose status has been left unresolved for far too long.
*****

11
Excellencies,
No one is winning today's wars.
From Syria to Yemen, from South Sudan to the Sahel, Afghanistan and elsewhere, only political solutions can bring peace.
We should have no illusions. We will not be able to eradicate terrorism if we do not resolve the conflicts that are creating the disorder within which violent extremists flourish.
Last week I announced the creation of a High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation. Those eminent individuals will allow us to be more effective in brokering peace around the world.
*****

12
The United Nations is forging closer partnerships with key regional organizations such as the African Union, the European Union, the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
We continue to strengthen and modernize peacekeeping  protecting civilians and saving lives around the world.
And since taking office, I have sought to bring together the parties to conflict, as well as those that have influence on them.
As a meaningful example, I am particularly hopeful about tomorrow's meeting on Libya.
*****

13
Last month, I visited Israel and Palestine. We must not let today's stagnation in the peace process lead to tomorrow's escalation. We must restore the hopes of the people. The two-state solution remains the only way forward. It must be pursued urgently.
Excellencies,
But I must be frank: in too many cases, the warring parties believe war is the answer.
They may speak of a willingness to compromise.
But their actions too often betray a thirst for outright military victory, at any cost.
Violations of international humanitarian law are rampant, and impunity prevails.
*****

14
Civilians are paying the highest price, with women and girls facing systematic violence and oppression.
I have seen in my country, and in my years at the United Nations, that it is possible to move from war to peace, and from dictatorship to democracy. Let us push ahead with a surge in diplomacy today and a leap in conflict prevention for tomorrow.
Excellencies, Fourth, climate change puts our hopes in jeopardy.
Last year was the hottest ever. The past decade has been the hottest on record.
Average global temperature keeps climbing, glaciers are receding and permafrost is declining.
*****

15
Millions of people and trillions of assets are at risk from rising seas and other climate disruptions.
The number of natural disasters has quadrupled since 1970.
The United States, followed by China, India, the Philippines and Indonesia, have experienced the most disasters since 1995  more than 1600, or once every five days.
I stand in solidarity with the people of the Caribbean and the United States who have just suffered through Hurricane Irma, the longest-lasting Category 5 storm ever recorded.
*****

16
We should not link any single weather event with climate change. But scientists are clear that such extreme weather is precisely what their models predict will be the new normal of a warming world.
We have had to update our language to describe what is happening: we now talk of mega-hurricanes, superstorms and rain bombs.
It is high time to get off the path of suicidal emissions. We know enough today to act. The science is unassailable.
I urge Governments to implement the historic Paris Agreement with ever greater ambition.
I commend those cities that are setting bold targets.
*****

17
I welcome the initiatives of the thousands of private enterprises  including major oil and gas companies  that are betting on a clean, green future.
Energy markets are telling us that green business is good business.
The falling cost of renewables is one of the most encouraging stories on the planet today.
So is the growing evidence that economies can grow as emissions go down.
New markets, more jobs, opportunities to generate trillions in economic output.
The facts are clear. Solutions are staring us in the face. Leadership needs to catch up.

Las Naciones Unidas estn dispuestas a ser un foro en el que los Estados Miembros, la sociedad civil, las empresas y el mundo acadmico puedan reunirse y hablar sobre el camino a seguir, en beneficio de todos.
Excellencies,
Finally, I want to talk about human mobility, which I do not perceive as a threat even if some do. I see it as a challenge that, if properly managed, can help bring the world together.
*****

25
Let us be clear: we do not only face a refugee crisis; we also face a crisis of solidarity.
Every country has the right to control its own borders. But that must be done in a way that protects the rights of people on the move.
Instead of closed doors and open hostility, we need to re-establish the integrity of the refugee protection regime and the simple decency of human compassion. With a truly global sharing of responsibility, the numbers we face can be managed.
But too many states have not risen to the moment.
I commend those countries that have shown admirable hospitality to millions of forcibly displaced people. We need to do more to support them.
*****

26
We also need to do more to face the challenges of migration. The truth is that the majority of migrants move in a well-ordered fashion, making positive contributions to their host countries and homelands.
It is when migrants move in unregulated ways that the risks become clear  for states but most especially for migrants themselves exposed to perilous journeys.
Migration has always been with us.
Climate change, demographics, instability, growing inequalities, and aspirations for a better life, as well as unmet needs in labour markets, mean it is here to stay.
*****

27
The answer is effective international cooperation in managing migration to ensure that its benefits are most widely distributed, and the human rights of all concerned properly protected.
But from ample experience, I can assure you that most people prefer to realize their aspirations at home.
We must work together to make sure that they can do so.
Migration should be an option, not a necessity.
We also need a much stronger commitment of the international community to crack down on human traffickers, and to protect their victims.
*****

28
But we will not end the tragedies on the Mediterranean, the Andaman Sea and elsewhere without creating more opportunities for regular migration. This will benefit migrants and countries alike.
I myself am a migrant, as are many of you. But no one expected me to risk my life on a leaky boat or cross a desert in the back of a truck to find employment outside my country of birth.
Safe migration cannot be limited to the global elite.
Refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants are not the problem; the problem lies in conflict, persecution and hopeless poverty.
*****

29
I have been pained to see the way refugees and migrants have been stereotyped and scapegoated  and to see political figures stoke resentment in search of electoral gain.
In today's world, all societies are becoming multicultural, multiethnic and multi-religious.
This diversity must be seen as a richness, not a threat. But to make diversity a success, we need to invest in social cohesion, so that all people feel that their identities are respected and they have a stake in the community as a whole.
Excellencies,
We need to reform our world, and I am committed to reforming our United Nations.
*****

30
Together, we have embarked on a comprehensive reform effort: -- to build a UN development system to support States in bettering peoples' lives; -- to reinforce our ability to safeguard people's peace, security and human rights; -- and to embrace management practices that advance those goals instead of hindering them. We have launched a new victims-centered approach to preventing sexual exploitation and abuse. We have a roadmap to achieve gender parity at the United Nations  and we are already on our way. Excellencies, We are here to serve: to relieve the suffering of ""we the peoples""; and to help fulfill their dreams.
*****

31
We come from different corners of the world. Our cultures, religions, traditions vary widely -- and wonderfully. At times, there are competing interests among us. At others, there is even open conflict. That is exactly why we need the United Nations. That is why multilateralism is more important than ever. We call ourselves the international community. We must act as one.
*****

32
Only together, as united nations, can we fulfil the promise of the Charter and advance human dignity for all. Thank you. Shokran. Xie Xie. Merci. Spasibo. Gracias. Obrigado.
*****"
Serbia,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Honorable Mr. President Lajcak, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on assuming this extremely important duty.
Honorable Excellency, Mr. Thomson, I would like to congratulate you on your successful presidency of the 71st session of the General Assembly. I avail myself of this opportunity to thank and to pay my tribute to the new Secretary General Mr. Antonio Guterres for his active engagement during the first year of his tenure, for a remarkably responsible duty of the Secretary General and for initiating reform process of great importance for the Organization.
It is my great honor to address you for the first time from this place in the capacity of the President of the Republic of Serbia.
We have carefully followed the world leaders in previous two days. It seems that we would not overemphasize if it would be said that almost everybody was speaking about the necessity of the reform of the UN, about peace and stability, often accusing someone else - a confronted party - acting as someone preventing mentioned peace and stability or as someone responsible for the difficult situation in the world. I would do my best to avoid that kind of approach.
Last year at this very place it was said that the situation worldwide was difficult. Today it is certainly more difficult than it was a year ago.
Today, ! take opportunity to speak in front of you not for attacking those who cannot defend themselves here, but neither for attacking those who wouldn't have arguments to defend themselves from the truth, i'11 speak about Serbia, its people, its reentering the world, a fact that world is accepting and embracing Serbia again, but that Serbia is trying to understand the world, even if it sometimes might not agree with great powers. Unlike some leaders, I have no need to patronize my people or to run election or non election campaign from this stage, because we have already won all our internal political battles. That's the reason why I'll speak about Serbia today, Serbia in the future as well as the future of the entire Western Balkans region I come from.
Why it is important to speak about the entire Balkans, especially its Western part. Because without broader and more serious insight into the problem we are facing, we will not be able to see let alone resolve our individual problems.
I would like to share with you a quotation by our famous writer Isidora Sekulic, who said the following:
!

""A peninsula is a separate world. Countries and nations in it, as if embarked on one boat, must have one common political problem and a political ideal, no matter how different they usually might be. The Balkan comes first, before all the countries in the Balkans, whenever the moment is difficult and dangerous, regardless of being dangerous politically or in terms of culture. (Will the Balkans for once open its sleepy eyes and see its paramount cultural capacity, if it plunges as a whole?)
Condition number one for the prosperous future of and for all us in that region is how to preserve peace and tranquility.
The Republic of Serbia invests a lot of efforts in stabilization of the situation in the region, which is our permanent commitment and politics. Just like we have been doing so far, we will continue to work devotedly and committedly on promotion of regional stability and cooperation; we believe that it is an investment in a better tomorrow for all of us. For today's success and progress in the future it is necessary, no matter how pathetic it might seem to someone, to preserve the peace and stability no matter what, which is a priority political task, with a daily hard work and learning as the most important social task and economic growth and reforms as a prerequisite for better life of, in the first place, poor ones and the middle class.
In previous period, we in Serbia have shown that with responsible politics of fiscal consolidation, even without huge privatization incomes, we could provide surplus in our budget; decrease unemployment rate from 26% to 12%; create flexible labor market by introducing modern laws, even when some much stronger countries of the developed West are having troubles with it. And more than anything, I am proud that we started to invest into creativity of our young people; that digitalization and artificial intelligence are becoming important topics in Serbia and not only in the most developed countries of the world. Of course, there are still so many things that we must deliver, and when you come from the Western Balkans the first question is whether we would be a part of some new conflicts, or we will have better and carefree future. In spite of numerous challenges, Serbia will keep investing efforts for creating conditions for new quality of relations within the region, based on mutual respect and commitment to common European future.
Today I would particularly like to refer to the political issues in the region and Belgrade's relations with Pristina. Having in mind the paramount importance of this issue for the Republic of Serbia, I will underline once again that reaching a political solution for the issue of Kosovo and Metohija is a national priority for Serbia. It's an issue that has a huge effect on our economy, but also on a clear future of the young people both in Serbia and in the entire region. You all know that we do not recognize the unilateral declaration of independence of the so called ""Kosovo"", but I will not speak about disrespect for our territorial integrity and sovereignty, instead VII speak about our efforts to resolve the problem. To try to find a solution for a centuries long problem, related to which great powers were not helpful back in 1999 and 2008. I'il speak about our efforts to talk about future with Albanian leaders from Pristina.
Yesterday I heard Michael Bloomberg saying that it is better to spend thousands of hours talking than one minute fighting.
2

Everything that has been achieved so far through Brussels dialogue was a result of difficult compromises, with unambiguous concessions on both, but still mostly on our side. Significant progress reached throughout this process confirms constructiveness and commitment of the Republic of Serbia to the dialogue. We also demonstrated readiness for compromises that were not easy, contributing thus to finding mutually acceptable solutions for many complex issues. I want to emphasize that in the last 4 years, after we started with dialogue process in Brussels, although there were some fights and quarrels, physical attacks against the Serbs in the territory of Kosovo and Metohija nobody has been killed in ethnic confrontations. For us Serbs and for Albanians as well it is a great step forward, and therefore i am eager to continue in the future with such political efforts.
Additionally we invested paramount efforts in stabilization of overall circumstances in the Balkans. We often stayed silent for insults and attacks coming from some other countries, because we knew that peace and reconciliation are more important than gaining easy political points.
Precisely because of that, Serbs are more than eager to continue with successful economic reforms, as well as with the idea for creation of the Regional Economic Zone, which we do not intend to give up on. Former Yugoslavia was widely respected as a market, and for its success in attracting investors and international attention. Today, we are too small as individual markets to have better and more prosperous performance, and therefore I firmly believe that unique customs zone and taxation system is the future of the region. For example, a farmer producing milk only 10 km away from the border loses at least 7-8% of its profit, just for wasting 48 hour to cross in the territory of another country.
And that better and improved economy is the second biggest task for all our nations and for Serbia as well.
The third thing that is not less important than the first and the second one, and that is uniting these both big tasks are economic progress and our aspiration for EU membership. Path towards the membership to the EU, which is our most important trade and investment partner, is seen as a path towards greater stability, economic progress and strengthening democracy acquis. In previous years, EU enlargement policy towards the Western Balkan countries acted as one of the most powerful instruments in political and economic transformation of the countries of the region into stable and modern societies. We believe that this policy, regardless of all the difficulties existing within the EU itself, as well as in the candidate countries and potential candidates, must continue in equally strong manner. We all want to be a part of the EU, but sometimes people in the Balkans and people in Serbia are treated in an unfairly different manner than those who had embarked that boat earlier.
We are not asking from the EU to speed up our accession process, but to treat us fairly and at least to some extent in the same manner like it had treated some of the already full Member States, that were admitted after 2003.

As you all know, Serbs are dignified people and we are expecting all other countries worldwide to respect us the way we respect them and their territorial integrity and sovereignty. We have never wanted nor will we want something that belongs to somebody else we only ask for equal respect for our country and its people.
i am proud that Serbia protects its freedom, independence and sovereignty and for acting as a country observing democratic principles. We will continue and never give up the politics of military neutrality, because we believe that such a politics is a politics of the peace and future. While we strive towards the EU and establish partnership relationship with the western countries, including and improving our relationship with the US, at the same time we keep cherishing the best possible relations with Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China. And not only that we are not ashamed of those good relations, we are proud of them. But we'll always stand ready to observe developments in today's world by not judging superficially what's right or wrong, or what's just or unjust. We have never threatened anybody nor we will, but we will always dare to say and condemn if somebody, by launching only a single missile forces inhabitants of the Japanese island of Hokkaido to spend a day or a night in shelters, i would like to remind that courageous and wise American President Dwight D. Eisenhower was prudent enough to say that ""every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."" Likewise, we will always show care and solidarity for Syrian, Afghan, Sub-Saharan or any other refugees. All the aforementioned will not diminish fierceness and sharpness in confronting international terrorism and radical Islamic movements like ISIS or AI Qaida, because we consider the democratic society of equal rights for all as the only possible society we want to live in and in which we see our future.
Honorable Excellencies,
We recognize fighting poverty and social inequality in the context of preventing the phenomenon of radicalism and strengthening extremism as a very important task. Integration of citizens of all religions and political and other affiliations into modern society based on common values, but with respect for right to identity and respecting everybody.
Distinguished Excellencies,
Serbia believes and expresses its satisfaction for the more and more important role of the UN not only in keeping peace and stability, but because of much more important tasks the Organization performs to the benefit of the mankind today. Each UN reform leading to the strengthening of its role will be supported by Serbia, because it means more discussions, rare use of force and less arrogance in international relations. And therefore our job is to do everything in order to enable more active role of the UN in processes worldwide.
Anyway, and I'll finish with it, the great Albert Einstein said: ""The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.'
Thank you for your attention!

Seychelles,"President of the General Assembly, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.
I would like to join those who spoke before me in congratulating Your Excellency, Mr Miroslav Lajcak (pronounced as MIH-roh-slahv L-EYE -chahk), on your election as President of this 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
I would also like to thank His Excellency, Ambassador Peter ThomSon, for making the small island developing states and the rest of the international community proud by his strong leadership of the 71st session.
Mr. President, May I start by saying that the thoughts of the Government and people of Seychelles go out to the millions of people in South Asia, Africa, the United States, and Mexico, and our island brothers and sisters in the Caribbean who have suffered unimaginable losses from floods, hurricanes and other forms of extreme weather these past months.
We-urge the international community to not only respond generously to these countries' calls for support, but to take far more seriously the need to upscale the urgent action required to prevent, prepare for, adapt to and recover from such increasingly destructive climate-related disasters.
Mr. President, Events around the world today sadly show that the theme of this year's General Debate, ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"", cannot be achieved without effective implementation of the principles of democracy and a concerted demonstration of will. This calls for good governance, transparency and accountability which are the foundation for the prosperity and security of a nation. Indeed, they put the rights and aspirations of the people at the centre of development where prosperity is shared by all.
We must create the necessary space within society where diverging views and ideas can flourish and be respected. Doing so helps promote unity, tolerance and respect in the population.
Mr President, Seychelles is, for the first time in its history, experiencing a system of political cohabitation where I as President and the head of the executive arm am working with a legislature dominated by the Opposition.
When I first addressed our legislature, the National Assembly, almosta year ago last October, I gave it my word we would work together to deliver a better future for our people.

Our cohabitation is working well. There is a new working environment; one in which there is dialogue, and one where we consult. And most importantly, one based on mutual respect.
We are reshaping Government, making it more inclusive and we are empowering our citizens, especially our youth, giving them equal opportunities to play important roles in the development of our country and the growth of our economy. In this context, we are improving the environment for free media to play a vital role in nation building efforts.
Together with the National Assembly, we are amending legislation relating to institutions, authorities and agencies to ensure they reflect the new principles of good governance. With greater transparency, good governance and accountability, the independence of institutions and authorities will continue to increase. They are the bedrock of our society.
We are writing a new chapter in Seychelles; where we work together to overcome our challenges and show respect for all opinions in the interest of a Seychelles that unites all of us despite our differences.
This openness and policy of discourse is at the core of my nation's willingness to secure a bold future for our people. I believe that Small Island Developing States such as mine are the moral barometers for what is right.
We do not shy from accepting and learning from others experiences but in this regard, we also have valuable lessons to share with others.
The path that we are charting in our country can serve as an example for all for the sake of tolerance and a globally lasting peace.

Mr. President, For there to be peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet, it is not enougl just to throw more resources - financial, human and others - into implementing the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change.
All these processes should be democratically governed, underpinned by transparency and accountability along the way, and in harmony with, and with respect for the natural environment in which we live.
In Seychelles, the private sector, civil society, NGOs and parliamentarians have joined with the public sector in a national effort to integrate the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals into our country's budget and development plans. Together we are drafting a new national development strategy and a more sustainable national development plan for Seychelles for the next 15 years called Vision 2032.
This exercise also includes the integration of Africa Agenda 2063 and the Samoa Pathway for small island developing states.
Mr. President, The same inclusive approach applies to stepping up our implementation of the Paris Agreement in the light of recent developments. According to the latest science, all stakeholders need to be involved if the international community is to drastically scale up our collective climate action to achieve our targets.
There is something I said at the COP22 climate summit in Marrakech last November that holds true even more so today as we head into COP23 led by our fellow small island developing state of Fiji supported by Germany.
Referring to the Paris Agreement, I said, and I quote, ""For the very first time in history, a global climate change deal, giving renewed hope to the world, has been reached.

We find ourselves at a crossroads and cannot afford to renege on our collective commitment to travel the moral path for the sake of humanity."" Mr. President,
From small islands come big ideas. Last year Seychelles reached an agreement with the Paris Club as well as others on a first-of-its-kind US;21 million debt-for-adaptation swap to protect 30% of our 1.37-million-square-kilometre exclusive economic zone, partly as ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change.
Also, we aim to launch the world's first blue bonds by the end of this year to raise another US15 million for sustainable fishing practices in our waters. Both these measures seek to establish innovative sources of financing to implement sustainable development goal 14 on oceans and seas and other interlinked SDGs as part of developing the Seychelles blue economy.
We thank our many partners at home and abroad who have helped us on this bold and exciting new path to sustainable development and resilience to climate change, and who continue to be actively involved.
In closing Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Fiji and Sweden for the great success of The Ocean Conference in June and its Call for Action.
As President of a large ocean developing state, I would like to reiterate SeycHelles' commitment to continue playing a pioneering role in finding innovative ways to respond to the Call for Action and implement SDG14 as an integral part of all the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda.
On this positive note, Mr. President, I thank you all."
Sierra_Leone,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen
I bring you fraternal greetings and very best wishes from His Excellency Dr.
Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone. President Koroma deeply regrets that he is unable to participate in this 72^ Session of the General Assembly due to unavoidable circumstances. He has however instructed me to deliver to you this message from him, and I quote:
""I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of responsibility to direct the work of the Seventy-Second Session of the General Assembly, and to assure you of my personal and country's support throughout your tenure. Let me also congratulate and warmly welcome our new Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio
Guterres.
I want to commend and thank your predecessors, Mr. Peter Thomson and Mr. Ban Ki-moon respectively for their distinguished leadership and outstanding commitment to advancing our collective ambitions and energy to maintaining global peace and security as well as achieving sustainable development and climate change for all.
I look forward to working with you in upholding and fulfilling our objectives as
set out in our United Nations Charter.
Mr. President,
Let me particularly commend the United Nations for its significant contribution to restoring peace, security, stability and economic reconstruction in my country. Sierra Leone, during our very trying times of war and its aftermath. I am happy to note that today. Sierra Leone is described by the United Nations through its Peace Building Commission as a proud storehouse of lessons for a seamless transition from war to peace, democracy and stability. These lessons have provided us with valuable and cost-effective tools for the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention. We have always been more than ready and willing to share them with other countries in a similar plight, especially within our membership of the g7+ group of post-conflict countries who are striving to exit fragility and promote resilience.
Mr. President,
The choice of the theme for this Session: ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet^, is apt and timely in an era of global uncertainties and challenges, including the emergence of new threats that tend to undermine our efforts in ^he promotion of the economic and social

advancement of all peoples'. For seventy-two years, through this organization, we have combined our efforts to prevent a major war, promote human rights and fundamental freedoms, justice and equal rights of men and women of all races. Yet, we are faced with unprecedented global challenges of enormous proportions. The seemingly unending cycles of conflict and violence, the destructive and devastating impacts of climate change, the spread of terrorism and the largest refugee, migration and humanitarian crises in recent history continue to question the effectiveness of our present international machinery, as well as our ability to promote peace and decent life for all on a sustainable planet. We should therefore generate innovative ideas and credible mechanisms that will bring all conflicts to a peaceful end; promote social progress, peace and security, human rights and fundamental freedoms; and secure better standards of life for humanity. We must remain steadfast to our commitment to building a sustainable planet for present and succeeding generations. This Assembly should in that regard, reflect on reform measures that will reinforce our collective obligation to upholding the purposes and principles upon which our organization was founded.
Mr. President,
Two years ago, this Assembly adopted the groundbreaking resolution 70/304 on strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes. It is Sierra Leone's firm belief that we must continue to build on gains made in our preventive diplomacy efforts, including heightened collaboration with each other, and among our regional organizations and actors, making use of experiences that have helped us achieve relative international peace and security. I am in that regard, heartened by the profound impetus of the preferential use of preventive diplomacy, as well as mediation efforts in the maintenance of international peace and security by the UN system. The good offices of the Secretary General, including the early warning system, and the international contact groups are important instruments in our pursuit to prevent conflict and must be further strengthened to effectively respond to any crisis situation. The effective utilization of Chapter VI of the Charter therefore remains the best option for this Organization in the prevention and peaceful settlement of disputes.
Obviously, mediation remains a powerful instrument for the prevention and settlement of armed conflicts and must be utilized to the fullest extent possible. My country has indeed benefited from mediation efforts under the auspices of the United Nations and ECOWAS. We have learned from experience that for mediation efforts to be fruitful, they must embrace such measures as the timely cessation of hostilities, credible cease-fire agreements and the timely deployment of peacekeeping and/or observer missions to undertake and supervise disarmament, demobilization and re-integration of ex-combatants.

Furthermore, the role of regional organizations in partnership with the United Nations must be further strengthened to ensure greater response at the regional level in implementing preventive measures such as early warning mechanisms. Regional organizations are usually better positioned to generate the necessary political will for conflict prevention within their regions. The role of the Feacebuilding Commission has been exemplary and the experience, expertise and knowledge that exist within its work in preventing countries from relapse should be tapped to prevent conflict from escalating into violence or war. In this regard, we encourage the sharing of the experiences gained and lessons learned by PBCcountry configurations.
Mr. President,
Since I assumed the leadership of Sierra Leone almost ten years ago, the country continues to make steady progress, particularly in the priority sectors of infrastructure, human development, agriculture and food security, democracy, international relations and inclusive governance, as outlined in my medium-term development plans, the ""Agenda for Change"", followed by the ""Agenda for Prosperity"". These transformative strategies have gone a long way in repairing and healing more visibly the damage and scars resulting from a brutal war, while also charting out the path for achieving sustainable socio-economic development and shared prosperity, and more particularly, for transforming Sierra Leone into a Middle Income country by the year 2035.
Mr. President,
Three years ago, in 2014, the unexpected and unprecedented outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease substantially wiped out the social and economic gains which Sierra Leone had painstakingly achieved over 10 years of progressive postconflict reconstruction effort. Shortly after being recognized as one of the countries with the highest growth rate in the world, our economy plunged very sharply, from record high GDP growth rates of 15.2% and 20.1% in 2012 and 2013 respectively, to record low rates of 4.6% and minus 21.7% in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The epidemic revealed fundamental systemic weaknesses that had remained to be addressed in post conflict Sierra Leone, especially in the health care system. The fight to end, eradicate and prevent the re-occurrence of the Ebola Virus Disease was largely achieved through a strong leadership community ownership and national resilience.
Mr. President
While we were on the verge of turning the corner in our post Ebola recovery strides. Sierra Leone was severely hit in the early hours of 14*^ August, this year, by torrential rainfall, leading to flash flooding in several areas of the capital city, as well as the collapse of the hillside of Mount Sugar Loaf, overlooking Freetown

and its environs, causing wide spread devastation. The impact was heart rendering, especially for women and children who were most affected. Over five hundred lives were lost; several persons were severely injured and traumatized; more than six hundred persons remain missing; about seven thousand persons were rendered homeless; and physical property and assets worth an estimated thirty million United States dollars lost. This year's rainfall is the third in a series of heavy torrential rains with devastating impact, most times on vulnerable groups in our cities: displacing hundreds of people, destroying farm land, businesses, properties and costing lives. These disasters are a stark reminder that climate change is real. They also demonstrate the level of Sierra Leone's vulnerability to climate change.
Let me once again, seize this opportunity to thank the international community for its support during these moments of grief and need, without which I could not have been counting the successes I am proudly reporting today.
Mr. President,
Under my leadership. Sierra Leone has enhanced political stability by strengthening institutions and laying the basis for good governance, allowing the institutions sufficient leverage and latitude to deliver on their respective statutory mandates. My Government has recorded significant milestones in the areas of gender equality and women's empowerment as well as in promoting youth employment and empowerment. We have established a more stable and regulatory environment for investment and wealth generation, which in the medium and long term will create employment opportimities for inclusive socio economic development of the youth, the disabled, and women. My Government's programmes on local government and decentralization have provided greater space for wider and deeper community participation in our development trajectory. Furthermore, the launch of the Open Government Initiative in 2008, followed by our membership of the Open Government Partnership in 2014, have together created an effective platform for transparent governance and citizens empowerment, thereby building trust and confidence between my Government and the People.
Mr. President,
With these developments. Sierra Leone is now on a solid path and will continue to consolidate the transition from war to peace, shore up democratic credentials, inclusive growth and a decent life for all.
Learning from the EVD outbreak, my Government is building a resilient health system that will be positioned to prevent, detect, and respond to any public health threat of similar nature. We have established public health laboratories nationwide, which do have full capabilities to test for viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola. The floods and mudslides are pointing to a greater emphasis on

the environment, in particular, land management, afforestation, affordable housing, urbanization, and slums upgrade.
The response of the international community in providing support and show of solidarity with us has been unprecedented and Sierra Leoneans do appreciate your kind and timely interventions. We have remained determined to accelerate the positive transformation of Sierra Leone, ensuring that Sierra Leoneans benefit from the dividends of our well-earned peace and democracy. We therefore look forward to more strategic engagement with our partners in effectively implementing the SDGs in Sierra Leone, especially in diversifying our economy with a focus on agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and manufacturing industries, as well as investment in education and health. Economic potentials remain enormous in these resourceful sectors for public-private partnerships, south-south, northsouth and triangular cooperation.
Mr. President,
Sierra Leone is at an advanced stage of preparation for another cycle of Presidential, Parliamentary and Local Government elections, which also marks the end of my second and final term as President of Sierra Leone. We have previously held three highly successful and widely acclaimed peaceful, free and fair democratic elections following the end of the civil conflict. Those are milestones that significantly demonstrate our exemplary performance in the consolidation of peace and security. The elections to be held will not be different in transparency, fairness and credibility.
1 will be leaving office with the sincere hope that successful implementation of the projects and programmes I have laid out will enhance Sierra Leone's attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. I will continue to roll out my Government's development agenda even more robustly, including an energy revolution, embarking on massive nationwide implementation of much needed solar mini grids aimed at providing energy to our remote areas. There is serious effort to digitalize the country as an enabler of accelerated development. It is my fervent hope that this momentum and development trajectory, defined by transformative strategies and catalytic actions, will be maintained with your sustained partnership with my successor. I therefore thank all development partners, both at the bilateral and multilateral levels, who have collaborated with us to support the strides we have achieved during my tenure.
Mr. President
As Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and
Government on the Reform of the UN Security Council, I would like to end my remarks by reiterating Africa's concern regarding the slow pace of the reform

process. We have heard this concern expressed by the current Chair of the African Union, His Excellency Professor Alpha Conde, President of the Repubhc of Guinea as well as by several other Heads of State and Government.
Mr. President,
Beyond the compelling urge to correct the historical injustice done to Africa, we must strongly reflect on the present geo-political realities which generally compel the reform and modernization of the UN system, particularly the Security Council. We must also reflect on the Continent's numerical strength, its growing economic power, its population dynamics, and its increasing role in the multilateral system. Against this background, Africa's demand, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration, is therefore even more legitimate, and ought to be redressed and treated on the basis of equity in the global governance system.
In conclusion, Mr. President, as we look at the work that lies ahead, let us not lose sight of our shared obligation in ensuring a peaceful and secure world by resolving our differences, including national and international disputes, through constructive dialogue. We must respect and prioritize strengthening the existing mediation mechanisms provided in the Charter.
1 am convinced that the pace of global development and the achievement of peace and security will be significantly accelerated if we appreciate the wisdom in redirecting resources from the current nuclear arms race to people-centered development. This will benefit mankind more than continuing the competition for superiority at our detriment. It will also facilitate the attainment of our desired twin goals of sustainable peace and development.
I thank you for your attention""."

1

I congratulate His Excellency Miroslav Lajcak on his

election as President of the 72^ session of the General

Assembly. I also congratulate Mr Peter Thomson ofFiji for his

leadership as President of the 7E' session.

2

We are meeting at a time of great imcertainty and

complex challenges globally. The old fault lines of race,

language and religion remain active. There is renewed anxiety

about jobs and inequality. New technologies and non-state

actors are challenging the international order. Terrorist groups

are using the intemet to spread their radical ideologies,

including in Southeast Asia. Cyber-attacks and fake news have

1

proliferated. Conflicts in many regions ofthe world remain and new ones have emerged.

3

In Northeast Asia, the DPRK's reckless actions are

raising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Singapore strongly

condemns the DPRK's missile and nuclear weapon tests in

violation of UN Security Council resolutions. We call on the

DPRK to avoid further provocative actions and to fully

implement the resolutions adopted by the Security Coimcil.

4

In Myanmar's Rakhine State, a humanitarian disaster

has occurred in the aftermath ofa terrorist attack on 25""'August

2017 and related acts of violence. This is a complex inter-

commrmal issue with deep historical roots. It is the

responsibility of every government to protect civilians

regardless of their ethnicities and religious beliefs. I visited Nay Pyi Taw last week and had a frank discussion with Daw

Aung San Suu Kyi. ASEAN Foreign Ministers will be meeting

later this afternoon. ASEAN supports Myanmar seeking a

long-term solution to restore stability. Singapore will work

with ASEAN and Myanmar to extend humanitarian assistance

to all affected communities.

Mr President,

5

Every country seeks to achieve the same thing: to

ensure the security and prosperity of oin: people; and to create

a better future for our children. But no country, no matter how

wealthy, big or powerful, can achieve this alone.

Multilateralism,

intemational

law,

constructive

interdependence and win-win cooperation are crucial for the

sustainable growth and prosperity of all oiu countries. A strong

multilateral system reinforces the resilience of individual

countries. This is particularly true for small states, which

depend on a rules-based multilateral system for our survival

and success. Today, I will speak on the importance of

multilateralism, an open global economy, and inclusive

economic growth.

Mr President,

6

My first point is that a universal, rules-based

multilateral system is essential to solving the complex

challenges facing the world. No nation can solve trans-

boimdary problems alone. We need to work with each other to

build consensus and find solutions to global problems. The United Nations (UN) plays a critical role, as a platform for cooperation, based on the principles of mutual respect, mutual
benefit and international law.

7

In fact, the UN remains the only universal body best

placed to address problems of the global commons. A good

example is the adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of

the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982, which is an enduring testament to

what collective political will can achieve. Today, UNCLOS is

the ""constitution"" that govems the use of the oceans.

8

The recent adoption of the Paris Agreement on

Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable

Development (2030 Agenda) showed that multilateralism can

respond to new challenges, especially when there is political

will and collective commitment. When dealing with global

issues like climate change, there is no alternative to

multilateralism. The UN must also deal with emerging global

challenges such as cybersecurity, counter-terrorism, and the

economic disruption caused by digital technologies, including

artificial intelligence.

9

If the UN is to remain relevant and effective, it must

also become ""fit-for-purpose"". There is much scope to

optimise S5mergies and minimise inefficiency. In this regard,

Singapore strongly supports the Secretary-General's efforts to

reform and restructure the UN; We welcome his management

reforms and his efforts to review the UN development system

as well as to streamline the peace and security architecture.

10

As a small state, Singapore has always been a strong

supporter of an effective UN. This year, we are proud that the

Forum of Small States (or FOSS), fovmded by Singapore in

1992, celebrates its 25*'' anniversary. Singapore is committed

to working closely with all states, including small states, to

support the work of the UN and to enhance its effectiveness.

11

Regional organisations are an important part of an

effective multilateral rules-based system. They help to

reinforce the principles of the UN charter and underpin

international law at the regional level. Equally important, they

help to build confidence and encourage habits of cooperation.

12

In Southeast Asia, ASEAN is celebrating its

anniversary. ASEAN has not only fostered regional economic

integration, it has secured regional peace and strengthened

national resilience by creating a sense of common identity in

the midst of great diversity. The prospects for ASEAN are

bright. Indeed, we have ambitious plans to do more, under our

vision of a united, resilient and innovative ASEAN

Community.

Mr President,

13

My second and related point is that an open global

architecture is essential for growth and sustainable

development. We have to make a choice between two models.

The first is a world divided by rival blocs, mercantilist

economies, proxy wars and zero sum competition. The second

model is an open interdependent world characterised by

enlightened national interests, win-win collaboration and

sustainable development. Singapore believes in the latter

model. In particular, an open, rules-based multilateral trading

system allows every country to prosper. For many countries,

especially small states, intemational trade and investments are

the primary pathway to growth and resilience. It is therefore important to remain steadfast in the face of rising protectionist sentiments. An open trading environment allows developing countries to export their goods and services and grow their economies. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is indispensable as it underpins the rules-based rhultilateral trading system and provides the framework for resolving trade
disputes.

14

The G20 is an important platform for discussing

global macro-economic and financial issues. However, it is

important that the G20 works closely with the UN and with non-members ofthe G20, in order to strengthen the multilateral system and to support the implementation ofthe 2030 Agenda.

We welcome the efforts of successive G20 Presidents to reach
out to non-members, in particular members of the Global Govemance Group, or 3G. As a grouping, the 3G will continue

to be an advocate for a more accountable and inclusive
framework of global govemance.

Mr President,

15

My third and final point is that inclusive economic

growth is a prerequisite to building resilient societies. Indeed,

the 2030 Agenda is fimdamentally a vision for achieving long

term inclusive economic growth, not only at the national level

but also at the regional and global level. It is a vision shared

by all countries. However, the challenge for every government

is to generate higher growth and create more jobs while

ensuring that no one is left behind.

16

In Singapore, we believe in hard work and self-

reliance. However, we also believe in taking care of fire weak

and vulnerable in every segment of our society. Our policies

on women, children, older persons, and persons with

disabilities, are designed to protect and uplift the most

vulnerable. We place great emphasis on racial and religious

harmony, and in building social cohesiveness.

17

Beyond resilience, successftil societies have to

embrace new technology and encourage innovation. The

digital revolution is fimdamentally changing the way we work.

the way we communicate and the way we live. We cannot wish away the change caused by disruptive technologies. We
have to restructure our economies and create new and better
jobs for our people. But this will not be an easy process.

18

The transformation caused by the digital revolution

will only be positive if we find ways to share the benefits

widely and reduce inequality. In Singapore, we have invested

heavily in education and skills training for our people, for both

the young and old, to give everyone an opportunity to build a

meaningful life. We want every Singaporean to have a stake in

our growth and success as a nation.

Mr President,

19

Let me conclude by saying that the UN has been a

catalyst for peace and development for more than seventy

years. It has made a significant difference to the lives ofpeople

around the world. In an environment ofincreased uncertainties,

the case for multilateralism becomes stronger, not weaker.

Now more than ever, we need the UN to help us find solutions

to difficult global issues. We need to safeguard and strengthen

our multilateral, rules-based system so that even the smallest country can survive and thrive as an independent, sovereign nation. We need an open global architecture based on
interdependence to secure sustainable prosperity for all. But
most of all, we need inclusive economic growth to empower all our people to lead a good and meaningfol life.

Slovakia,"Dear Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General.
Excellences, Distinguished delegates.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
It is a great pleasure to be here with you today.
Allow me to extend my congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the Presidency. And to wish you well in your endeavors during the entire session. I am convinced that under your leadership the General Assembly will swiftly and successfully advance its work.
Every single minute while I speak here twelve children die of hunger and more than one hundred is born to extreme poverty. Dozens die on preventable diseases. People die on this planet on diseases that we have been able to cure for decades. And it is responsibility of the people in this room to do everything in our powers to help them.
Challenges we face often don't require difficult strategies or unprecedented amounts of money. They need just our dedication and true leadership, on both sides. For those, who can help -- to give up on ignorance and selfishness. And for those who receive the help -- to put the people at the first place.
So, Mr. President, I want to commend you for choosing such a sound focus for this year's General Assembly session -- focus on our people, on striving for peace and decent life for all in sustainable conditions. Indeed, there is no bigger responsibility of us -- political leaders -- than to take care of this planet and to serve its people. Building safe, healthy, prosperous and just societies for every individual is not a mere ambition. It's our duty. It's the reason why our people trust us with the power to act on their behalf, to make use of limited resources our societies generate.
(13 I ll Z  )
Ladies and Gentlemen, our devotion to common principles, our virtue to keep promises, our ability to deliver results are the three most vital particles of any respectable public service. And there is no stronger enemy to the effort to make a real difference in this world than egoism, ignorance and narrow-minded national or personal interests.

It's the respect for the principles of peace and security that is essential to the life in dignity for all our people. These principles have been at the very core of this organization since its constitution. The first and the most important responsibility of us, the leaders, the members of the United Nations, is to stick to these principles and values, to enforce them and to punish those who violate them.
And yet far too many are dying in senseless conflicts or suffering in displacement resulting from the violence. The enormous human tragedies, material damage of armed conflicts and the refugee crisis depletes the muchneeded resources for social and economic development. This bloody reality of our times is a painful reminder of our ignorance and egoism.
Every year, after this gathering, we all return back to our homes. But there are over 60 million people who have no such place. People, who had to leave everything behind to save their lives and run away from poverty or horrors of war. These people don't ask for much. They just want to have a place to live, to raise children, to prosper with the loved ones. We need to make these people feel home again.
The way we treat our own people is as important to international security and peace as the way we treat each other. Recent findings about the use of chemical weapons by the Asad regime in Syria against its own citizens have to alarm all of us as much as the atrocities in Rakka, in Mosul and many other places in the world. All such horrors demonstrate how little respect is being paid to human lives -- to the very principle of humanity, especially when power games are played. Our resolve to act when the UN principles are at stake are often the last hope for those who desperately wait for our help trapped in the middle of the deadly violence, in the ruins of what they used to call their homes.
We are witnesses of short-sighted interests built on spreading instability, undermining collective efforts to secure peace and security. The very core of the UN Charter for securing peaceful coexistence among nations is crippled in the name of the selfish pursue, egoism of the so-called spheres of influence. Which is a fancy phrase too often misused only to cover violations of international order and to justify disrespect for sovereignty. It's a dangerous game of tragic outcomes and unintended consequences. We in

Europe can see it too. Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova, they all know the price of peace. They are all well aware of the pains of their sovereignty being undermined by an aggressive neighbor. Neighbor who thinks the rules does not apply to him.
So we shall not be surprised when things often go out of control and cause enormous and irreparable damage m to people, to countries and to this planet. Today we face one of the worst threats to international peace and security in recent history. North Korea openly threatens our world with nuclear weapons. Such a grave disrespect to human life cannot be tolerated. I strongly call on the North Korean regime to terminate its development of weapons of mass destruction and to return on the path of dialogue and building peace in the Korean Peninsula.
We need a collective resolve in the very spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. This organization must be firm in its principles and stand for what it has been created for. Some of us have a special responsibility to do so on a regional or international level. There is no room for geopolitical games or economic gains at the expense of our common security. It's millions of human lives that are at stake.
(po uzo)
We live the most prosperous times in the history of the humankind. We have all the tools and enough resources to help every human being on this planet to live a life in dignity, free from fear or hunger.
But there is one challenge which will test all the limits of our ability to
lead, to act together, to adapt, to reinvent our societies and the way we live our lives. We are beginning to see and feel the sinister consequences of our actions on the environment. Be it once-in-a-hundred years' floods repeating with high frequency, hurricanes that struck harder than before, or devastating droughts forcing people to abandon their homes. These disasters are not warnings of the future climate change. These powerful natural events are features of the new environment we live in.
Last year's adoption of the Paris agreement was an unprecedented demonstration of collective will to address challenges arising from the climate change our societies have to face. It may be remembered as a unique

iI
effort of the present generation of humankind to mitigate the consequences of our impact on the environment. It may become our ultimate legacy, a chance for our children to adapt and to live happily and safely again in the changed environment.
Our devotion to common principles, our virtue to keep promises and our ability to deliver results in this case is far more crucial than ever. No money, no short-term economic interests could possibly compensate the irreparable damage if we fail to act together and change our irresponsible behavior. The price of such planetary ignorance will be much higher than any we have ever paid.
Slovakia understands the urgency for collective action. We pushed for the swift ratification of the Paris Agreement under our European Union Presidency last year. I confirm that we will implement all necessary national measures to fulfill our obligations. Because The Paris Climate Agreement must be implemented in full.
Ladies and Gentlemen, This organization has served us well for decades. It has faced tough challenges. It excelled in some, it may have failed in others. But it has been the best we have had, with countless successes and with a well-deserved global authority. There are many pressing issues in today's world that had not been foreseen when the United Nations was created. Who would have imagined that one of the most important topics on the UN agenda would be the climate change? And yet we demonstrate we can somehow tackle such challenges. But it would be naive to think that just by applying the same old procedures we can achieve new results and address every new and unforeseen troubles. We need, as every organization, to adapt. I strongly believe we are capable of such adaptation. But let me underline strongly that while we strive for reform to be more efficient, the very core of the UN must be respected without exception. To succeed, it will require all of us to be responsible leaders, giving up on national egoism and ignorance -- to stand true to the principles of the United Nations Charter, to be honest with each other by keeping the

promises we give and to deliver results, in words and in deeds. Because there is no more noble task for us than to serve our people for them to live in peace, in dignity and in prosperity.
Thankyou."
Slovenia,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellences, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me start by congratulating His Excellency Miroslav Laj&k upon his election as the President of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly,.l wish him every success in discharging his duties. Mr

I would also like to congratulate His Excel!eny AntSnio Guterres upon his election as the Secretary-General. I commend his determination to promote the United Nations, its values and its goals, and his tireless endeavours to strengthen the Organisation.

Excellences,
The world continues to confront challenges to international peace and security. These are ever more complex and intertwined. Shocking images of human suffering are our daily reality. The consequence of armed conflicts, degrading environment, famine, lack of economic opportunities, grave breaches of human rights, and terrorism are just some of the global challenges. To be able to address them, effective international cooperation with the UN at its core is essential. We have the mandate and the responsibility to act. We must stand united to address global challenges together.
Despite the mentioned threats, I'm encouraged by a new dynamic and a strong push by the Secretary-General to bolster multilateralism and the UN reform agenda. I commend his strong will to make the UN stronger and fitt-er to sei-ve aS the bedrock of the international rules-based order. More than ever we need a strong UN to be one of the key actors for providing security, stability and life with dignity for all.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Two yearSago we,.,,,,v,..,,,'hi'-,,--,4 o mn,,f,-,n, ,,,,,o,v,, In agreeing on,,u,L4...;.V,E4;;I.U..I.JI ,I IE..;.I.I.1.
road map. Together, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Paris Agreement provide a framework and ,a vision for a more sustainable future of our planet and prosperity for all.

Now a true test is their implementation. This is not the time to go back on our promises. We need to turn them into real progress that will benefit people around the globe. Slovenia has embarked on this path with a sense of urgency. This is demonstrated, among others, in Slovenia's high ranking in the SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2017. Namely, Slovenia is among top 10 out of 157 measured countries in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
We are strongly engaged in protecting the environment and in ensuring its sustainability. We are determined to raise, awareness about the key factors shaping our sustainable future. For example, we recognize the key role of bees and other pollinators in preventing hunger, ensuring food security, improving human health, and in preserving the environment and its biodiversity. In this context we are proposing to the General Assembly to adopt the decision to declare the international day of bees and, therefore, announce May 20 as World Bee Day. I would like to thank all the states that already expressed support for this initiative and encourage others to do so.
Achieving sustainable development is only possible if the global community works together in a firm partnership between governments,
international organizations, civil society, academia and the private sector.

The same is true of large global migration and refugee flows. The shared responsibility and solidarity should be the guiding principle of our global approach. In this spirit Slovenia is constructively engaged in the process of consultations on the Global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration and. the Global compact on refugees. We believe that the adoption of both global compacts in 2018will be another major milestone in our path towards ensuring a life of dignity for all.
Excellences,
Without respect foi-human"" rights there can be no peace,, freedom,
promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms worldwide. But let's not forget that the primary responsibility for the fulfilment of human rights lies with the states.
Slovenia, as a current member of the Human Rights Council, is a strong supporter of human rights. In that spirit we continue to advocate a progressive approach to human rights issues, enhancing protection norms and standards at all levels.
Our main focus is given to the rights of children, to the support of gender equality and the empowerment of women as well as to the rights of older persons and in this context also the importance of the intergenerational collaboration.

There is still much to be done before we can ensure a life with dignity for all without discrimination.
More must also be done to mitigate harm to civilians, especially in the context of armed conflicts, and to prevent all forms of sexual violence. It is particularly despicable when people deployed to protect civilians engage in abuse. We therefore underline the need for a zero tolerance policy on all forms of sexualexploitation and abuse.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Respect for and the implementation of international treaties, decisions of international courts and tribunals and other sources of international law is indispensable for a functioning global community. Respect for the obligations arising from treaties and for other sources of international law is also embedded in the United NationsCharter. It is the very foundation of international peace and security. Moreover, it is an important guarantar of JdendlyJ_elations_aod cooperation among states. Slovenia recognizes the essential role of the rule of law and international law and has hence placed their respect in the very centre of our foreign policy.

In the rule of law context, ending impunity for the most serious international crimes remains an important goal for my government. Slovenia is committed to promoting international criminal justice, in particular the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The principles enshrined in the UN Charter attest to the natural partnership between the UN and the International Criminal Court. This relationship is expected to advance even further with the activation of the ICC's jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which is anticipated by the end of this year. We express our strong support for the swift
Understandably, the primary responsibility to prosecute atrocity crimes continues to restwith states. SIovenia, together with other leading states, will continue to actively pursue the improvement of the international legal framework for mutual legal assistance and extradition for domestic prosecution of the most serious international crimes.
Excellences,
Years and years of horrific war in Syria, conflicts in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Mali, and dire situations like those in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, to name just a few, continue to represent particular sources of concern. We call on all relevant parties to refrain from the use of force and invest in political dialogue.

Violent extremism and crimes committed by terrorist groups continue to plague the world. We must do all we can to prevent and stop them, in particular by providing viable alternative opportunities for youth. The UN plays a key role in countering terrorism, including the prevention of violent extremism. In this regard Slovenia welcomes the reform of the UN Counter Terrorism architecture. Slovenia also welcomes the resolution of the General Assembly which will strengthen the capability of the UN system to assist member states in implementing the UN Global CounterTerrorism Strategy.
As a strong supporter of non-proliferation and disarmament in the field of weapons of mass destruction, SIovenia is committed to treaty-based nuclear disarmament and arms control. We are of firm belief that we have to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons progressively through the full implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In this regard we strongly condemn the DPRK's violations of Security Council resolutions and of its international commitments. They pose a serious threat to peace and security in the
region-and-wider.
We must intensify our efforts to sustain peace everywhere, but most immediately in a wide range of fragile and conflict affected states. Conflicts cannot be prevented or resolved by addressing consequences alone; we must address the underlying causes. For this we need to think long term. The UN can help to defuse latent conflicts. Whenever possible we should opt for diplomacy, mediation and conflict prevention.

Excellences,
The emphasis must be on ""doing more collectively, timely and effectively"". This can be achieved only by a strong, robust, adaptable, knowledgeable and responsible United Nations. This is why Slovenia is very supportive of the reform efforts of the Secretary-General. Different parts of the UN system must be better coordinated. Duplication must be avoided, and the common goal must be to achieve tangible
results.
Let me conclude by assuring you that Slovenia is committed to
tangible, meaningful results that will advance peace, security, development and human rights for all.
Thank you."
Solomon_Islands,"Mr. President, Permit me to add the congratulations of my Delegation to those of other Distinguished colleagues on your election as President of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your great experience and wisdom as a diplomat will guide our work going forward in this session. I assure you that my delegation will, for its part, try to lighten your
burden by giving you the fullest cooperation throughout the proceedings of this august Assembly.
For your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, what can I say?
Not only was he Fiji's first President of a Session of our General Assembly but he was also the first Pacific Islander to assume that prestigious office. Among his many achievements was his championing of the 1,350 voluntary commitments made at the UN Ocean Conference held here in June. Allow me to thank the out-going President, Mr. Thomson, for a marvellous job done.
Mr. President,
Our world is going through difficult times. 2017 has been a year dominated by intentional provocation and natural disasters. As such, the decision to design our Theme ""Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet' is not only appropriate but indeed perfectly timed.
On this note, may I, on behalf of the People of Solomon Islands, extend our heartfelt sympathies to those affected by the recent natural disasters, in particular Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, We extend our sympathies to the families who have lost loved ones in the

recent earthquakes in Mexico (Mehiko). Whether it be tsunamis, cyclones, flooding or earthquakes, the Solomon Islands knows well the pain of having to live through such ordeals. Our hearts and prayers are with you. Mr President I believe that the theme can effectively be summed up in three words; ""peace, humanity and equality"". However, I am afraid, that the current status quo in the world today does not reflect those simple yet powerful words. Mr President, According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, approximately 65.6 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide at the end of last year. These statistics are the result of persecution, conflict, violence or human rights violations - consequences of human actions. Sadly, the majority of these displaced people are women and children. They are the most vulnerable to the evil designs of fellow human beings. They must therefore be protected. The protection of people is in the DNA of this organization. My government therefore reaffirms its support for the Responsibility to Protect. The international community must continue to stand firm in our fight to prevent crimes against humanity. Mr President,

I stand here with pride in saying that, today we in the Pacific continue to enjoy the world's most peaceful corner. Whilst we play a minor role in the geo-politics of this World, we are now once again caught up in the midst of global power play. Mr President, History shows that global events have often dictated those in the Pacific region. These were events beyond our control that were imposed upon us. These events have had lasting impacts on our peoples; Many of them negative. From bygone World Wars to Nuclear Tests to current instances of military provocation, we continue to deal with the remnants of these foreign imposed events. Mr President, For us in Solomon Islands, it was only a month ago that we celebrated 75 Years of the Anniversary of the Battle of Guadalcanal; a significant battle during the second world war. For many, World War II ended in 1945, but for us its remnants still remain. In the period between 2011 - 2017, approximately 37,000 unexploded ordnances weighing some 152,000 metric tons were destroyed. I thank the Governments of Australia and the United States of America for their assistance in this exercise. That exercise continues today. Mr President Again today, we are continually threatened by global power posturing that yet again attempts to dictate our fate as a region.

But today, we refuse to remain silent and it is on this note that I would like to register our strongest condemnation of the actions by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We too would like to echo the global call on DPRK to abide by the United Nations Security Council Resolutions.
Mr. President,
The recent testing of ballistic missiles by DPRK over the Pacific Ocean is an insult to the people of the Pacific. We are ocean people. The sea is our sanctuary. It is the foundation of our heritage. It is where our people source their food and income. Therefore, we denounce any pollution and contamination of our ocean that our pacific peoples depend on for our livelihoods. Mr President, As you are well aware, we in the Pacific supply approximately 60% of the worlds tuna market. This underscores the global significance of our region. Therefore, maintaining the health of our ocean is not only for the sake of our self-interest. The maintenance of our ocean, given its importance to global food security, should be in all our interest. As such, Solomon Islands reaffirms the principles enshrined in the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea for the peaceful use of the ocean spaces. Mr President, Whilst the threat of Nuclear Warfare is a genuine concern to us all, for us Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the impacts of climate change currently occurring at an alarming
rate on our shores, presents a clear and present danger.

Further to the above, ocean acidification now stands at 400 part per million carbon dioxide concentration, it has gone past safe level of 350 parts per million and soon it will begin to dissolve our corals at 550 parts per million.
Mr President, For us Pacific Island Nations, Climate change continues to be our enemy. We are continuously invaded by this enemy every day. In Solomon Islands, Mr President, we have lost 6 islands due to the effects of climate change. What was once a playing ground for children to play, is now inundated with water. For many of our peoples, talk of a sustainable world is becoming increasingly unattainable. We are in survival mode. The horrors of the impact of a nuclear attack is undeniable but the slow onset, caused by the adverse impact of climate change is just as cruel. Mr. President, If it's not happening yet, it shortly will. An unstable climate and the subsequent displacement and relocation of people can exacerbate some of the core drivers of conflict - such as migratory pressures, clash of cultures and competition for resources. These are threats to the very existence of humanity and could very well morph into threats to global peace and security. That is why the Pacific Small Island Developing States have been requesting the Security Council to also address the issue of climate change. Mr President,

The building of sea walls and wave breakers, to mitigate some of the impacts caused by climate change, while useful is nothing more but a mere band-aid solution. We call on all major emitters to meet their National Determined Contributions (NDCs) in reducing greenhouse emissions. We strongly urge the United States of America to reconsider its position on the Paris Climate Accord. Let us all stand together in solidarity to face the defining challenge of our time.
On COP23, Solomon Islands pledges its full support to Fiji as Chair. As a fellow Pacific Island country, we congratulate Fiji for your upcoming assumption of the Chairmanship and look forward to discussions on the effective implementation of Paris Climate Accord.
Mr. President,
On peace and security, Solomon Islands contributed a contingent of 5 Police Officers that had just completed their 12 months Tour of Duty in the United Nations African Mission in Dafur (UNAMID). This is Solomon Islands' first humble contribution to the maintenance of world peace.
Another 8 Police Officers, two of whom are women officers, are all set to go as soon as they secure their visas for Sudan. UNAMID was set up to protect civilians in Dafur where militia groups continue to be active and inter-communal violence still occurs. Work here could he made more effective if the UN's Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes is integrated into the pre-deployment and in-theatre training for all peacekeepers.
Mr President,

The mandate of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, fondly known as RAMSI, ended on June 30, 2017. On behalf of the People of Solomon Islands, I sincerely thank members of the Pacific Islands Forum for coming to our aid, to save us from ourselves. On this juncture, I would like to pay tribute to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice during the mission and thank their families for their loved ones' services.
I also would extend to Australia and New ZeaIand our deepest gratitude for their excellent leadership role in RAMSI.
RAMSI was premised on a regional security framework: the Biketawa Declaration. My Government is also very supportive of the Pacific Islands Leaders Communique from the 48th Forum Meeting calling for a comprehensive expansion and updating of the Biketawa Declaration. We believe that a Biketawa Plus that takes into consideration the security challenges the region faces today, as well as our collective responses to them, will contribute towards keeping the Pacific Islands region peaceful.
Mr. President,
Like other post-conflict countries, Solomon Islands will continue to face many challenges. Sustainable peace will require more than just effective policing or a functioning public service. It will require social and economic development initiatives that address the underlying causes of the conflict. Here I must thank the Peacebuilding Commission for facilitating our National Dialogue on Peace and Sustainable Development.
The Communique from this Dialogue clearly shows an inclusive and clear consensus on our priorities for sustaining peace. I therefore look forward for Solomon Islands to be formally declared eligible for peacebuilding support from the Peacebuilding Recovery Facility.

I must also thank the Board of the Green Climate Fund for approving 86 million US dollars for the Tina Hydro Project when it met in South Korea early this year. The project will create more than 200 jobs and will offset more than 44,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum in diesel emissions. It will also provide renewable energy, at a more affordable cost, to more than 100,000 people in and around our capital city of Honiara.
Mr. President, I have an issue here with the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf on the Ontong
Java Plateau (OJP) jointly submitted by Papua New Guinea, the Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands. Solomon Islands notes, with serious concerns, that the Commission, in its deliberation, has overturned the understanding we had reached with the Sub-Commission. And this concerns the connection of Duff and Anuta Islands to the continental margin of the OJP.
The Sub-Commission and our Joint Delegations reached mutually acceptable conclusions as a result of comprehensive interactions over two years. But we were not given the opportunity to address the amendments proposed by the Commission despite their serious implications for our Submission. Nor were we given the reasons for the amendments despite our repeated requests. We therefore have no other option but to consider making a revised submission.
A related issue is the negotiations on an implementing agreement under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea on conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdictions. The current negotiations undermine the fundamental principles embodied in the UN Charter and are grossly inadequate when addressing the

principle of adjacency, integration of traditional knowledge, transboundary and cumulative impacts as they relate to Small Island Developing States. There must also be some recognition for a funding mechanism that can adequately support the implementation of the proposed instrument.
Mr. President,
The preamble of the UN Charter speaks powerfully of our mission to 'reaffirm faith in the fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small."" This language clearly articulates the principle of universality, for all peoples and all nations regardless of their size and population. However, as we in this august Assembly speak of ""leaving no one behind,"" we are at the same time shutting the door to the people of Taiwan from participating in this universal process. We are therefore contradicting our own principles by leaving 23 million people behind. And yet the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda requires global partnership and the joint efforts of all stakeholders to mobilize all available resources. Taiwan is ready, willing and able to engage in and contribute to the wide range of substantive UN programmes for the welfare of humanity. If we are to focus on people Let's give Taiwan and its 23 million people a chance. If we are to promote peace and sustainability, let's give Taiwan and its 23 million people a chance. Let us not contradict the principles that the United Nations was established to represent and allow the rules to change subject to whose best interests are at stake.
10

Taiwan has been actively involved in UN programs and specialised UN Agencies. Despite the contributions of Taiwan towards the well-being of the citizens of the world, we continue to ignore the right of Taiwan to self-determination, as such, it is high time that this august body give due recognition to Taiwan as a legitimate member of the Family of Nations.
Mr. President, Article 73 of our Charter also speaks powerfully on fundamental human rights and in its 1960 'Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples', the UN General Assembly stated that ""the subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to world peace and cooperation"".
Thanks to this Article the people of New Caledonia will have a referendum in 2018 where they can finally decide, without fear or favour, on their political future. I wish them all the best. I must thank and commend the Administering power for working closely with the Committee of 24 on the issue of New Caledonia. I hope the same level of co-operation will also be shown on French Polynesia and that a C24 visit will occur soon. Mr President, Solomon Islands position on the aforementioned issues are premised on principles that we have consistently upheld. In this connection, Solomon Islands condemns the consistent human rights violations in West Papua.
11

Our Sustainable Development Goals that promote the notion of ""no-one left behind"" is synonymous to empty promises unless we, in the United Nations, take active steps to address the plight of the peoples of West Papua. Indeed, we have left them behind some 50 years ago when we, as a Family of Nations, noted their plight without much to add. Since then, the peoples of West Papua were never allowed the proper act of self-determination guaranteed by the inalienable right to self determination as expressed in UN human rights Covenants. Only international action -- by individual countries and from the leading organizational bodies of the international system, especially the United Nations General Assembly - can pave the way for the recognition of a people whose right to self-determination had been denied for nearly fifty years ago. Failing this, we as a Family of Nations will become complicit in perpetuating the suffering and being blind to the injustice; missing yet another golden opportunity to remain true to the saying of ""leaving no-one behind. At the 71st session, a group of Pacific Island nations called for this august body to address the human rights violations in West Papua. Today, I stand on behalf of my people and those in the Pacific region to reiterate that same call on this august body to address the plight of West Papuan women, children and men. Our people are watching, West Papuans inside West Papua are watching, praying and are hoping for a brighter future. They have come in numbers to express their hope for a better future. We as leaders have this responsibility of ""leaving NO-ONE BEHIND"".
12

I would therefore encourage Indonesia to engage in more constructive dialogue, including with West Papua to find a way forward in addressing the aspirations of the people of West Papua. I urge the UN to proactively engage in these dialogues as well. Mr. President,
Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread violations of human rights worldwide - my country and region included. Violence against women is an obstacle to gender equality in economic opportunities and livelihoods. The final Pacific Regional Millennium Development Tracking Report published in 2015, highlighted that violence against women was an impediment to achieving the MDGs. If our region is to achieve the SDGs we will need to intensify efforts, and increase support and cooperation to end violence against women and girls.
The Solomon Islands Family Protection Act 2014, was a national response to this urgent need to curtail the increasing rate of family violence. It was to ensure that homes in Solomon Islands, as important units of the community, are peaceful and safe for all members of a family. The Act covers any type of abuse that happens in the home between perpetrators and victims of domestic violence. Yes, we have made big strides in not just counting women but more importantly in making women count.
Mr. President, As a Small Island Developing State and Least Developed Country with inherent structural capacity constraints, we greatly rely on the United Nations system to support and augment our national efforts in implementing national development programs.
13

It is our hope that this expectation is met by concrete and measurable deliverables on the ground by our UN partners.
My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General's reform agenda and applauds his vision to reposition sustainable development at the heart of the United Nations. It's guiding framework, the 2030 Agenda, with its pledge to leave no one behind, is indeed our boldest agenda for humanity. For my country, this bold agenda will have to include fair representation in the recruitment of staff to the UN Secretariat. Despite only having one national at the UN Secretariat, we have not been invited to sit the young professional's exams for two years in a row now. We nevertheless remain steadfast in our support and encouragement of action for a strong and effective United Nations and we stand ready to support the Secretary-General's noble efforts in transforming the Organisation, including the Security Council.
Mr. President,
The UN is still the town hall of our global village. People know what it does but don't see much value in it. It is inevitably imperfect. As the organization's second Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, famously said ""the UN was not created to take humanity to heaven but to save it from hell"". Its imperfections, however, only mean that we need to work harder to make it better. Let's do it! Thank you Mr. President.
14"
Somalia,"Bismillahi Rahman! Rahim Mr. President
Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations Honourable Delegates,
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is an honour to address the 72""^ Session of the UN General Assembly.
I bring you warm greetings and good wishes from our President, H.E. Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmaajo, and the entire Government and People of the Federal Republic of Somalia.
Allow me to first congratulate the President of the 72""^ Session of the
UN General Assembly for assuming this role, and for ably steering this august body toward a successful gathering. This year's session also coincides on International Peace Day.

Yesterday, we observed the International Day of Peace. A day that called for togetherness and solidarity with those who have been forced to flee
their homes and those who leave home to seek a better life. The theme of
this year's General Assembly, speaks of peace and a decent life in a sustainable planet. The similarity in focus, goes beyond coincidence to acknowledge that the pursuit for peace, decent life, respect, safety and dignity is a global need yet elusive for hundreds of millions of people in the world today. From Syria to the Central African Republic, from the Rohingya people of Myanmar to the people of Libya, the number of protracted and new conflicts remains unacceptably high. The Somali people have for many years been the victims of war, famine and poverty, which has seen them displaced internally, while others made the perilous journey abroad. We therefore know too well, the necessity for others to open their doors to distraught and disillusioned people who just like us are looking for a safe and dignified living. I take this opportunity to thank all those who, even in challenging times, continue to uphold this spirit of oneness, of sharing and caring.

Mr. President,
Somalia is rising and we are determined to stay the course. Our aim is to contribute positively to the progress of our region, our continent and the world. Despite enormous challenges we are, among others, improving security, re-establishing law and order and conducting the necessary political and socio-economic reforms. The progress achieved so far, is because the Somali people have embraced a new dawn and our relentless partners continue to walk with us in our journey towards peace and prosperity. We will continue to formulate measures to strengthen Somalia's progress including in revenue generation, however, there are some serious challenges beyond the control of the Somali government. Debt relief would have the effect of unlocking concessional financing, attracting foreign investment and providing an opportunity that is critical to sustaining our reform efforts and consequently reinvigorate our economy. We are already working with International Financial

Institutions towards this objective and through this forum, seek your
support.
Mr. President:
Terrorism remains one of our pressing challenges, with its repercussions felt globally. As such, our unity in addressing this scourge, collectively and sustainably, is critical. No effort should be spared in neutralizing the growth and influence of international terrorist organizations such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda who as we know, are key influencers oflocalized terrorism. Efforts to step up military interventions against such groups should be re doubled. In Somalia, we have made significant strides, which have weakened the capability of Al-Shabaab. In this regard, I would like to thank AMISOM for their sacrifice, unfailing support, dedication and solidarity in the fight against Al-Shabaab. To ensure the sustainability of such gains, we are focused on strengthening the military capacity of our national security forces. However, the arms embargo imposed against Somalia is a severe limitation towards this objective. The Federal

Government of Somalia will continue to work with the Security Council and relevant actors on our roadmap towards lifting the arms embargo. Poverty and lack of education and livelihood opportunities remain contributing factors to the growth ofviolent extremism. Across the world,
disillusioned youth are at heightened risk of exploitation by criminal networks, including terrorists. The urgent need to invest in education, skills building and livelihood opportunities for our youth is crucial. Addressing these key strategic elements to counter terrorism is an enormous task, which requires a holistic approach and resources to match. We continue to call upon friends of Somalia to help us in this
important undertaking.
Mr. President,
We cannot talk about a sustainable planet without demonstrating
commitment to make this world livable for ourselves and the future
generation. Somalia is one of the countries ravaged by a vicious cycle of man-made and natural disasters created directly by environmental degradation. Rains are scarce, leading to crop failure and death of livestock, which subsequently leads to drought and famine. Currently the

humanitarian situation of millions of Somalis remains fragile as the bite of the current drought, which still threatens to develop into famine, continues. Our National Development Plan stipulates a clear and realistic roadmap to breaking this vicious cycle. However, Somalia, and many other countries who are on the receiving end ofclimate change are unable to find the resources required to tackle this ever-growing problem. In this regard, we urge all member states to continue improving Paris Climate Agreement which has the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change. Similarly, developing countries such as ourselves need investment in long term initiatives including infrastructure development, water conservation, innovative food and livestock production and creation of livelihood opportunities.
Mr. President,
We need to get better at streamlining global development and aid structures, especially for fragile states. We need to revisit the prevailing paradigms and take bold and innovative steps to improve this architecture. The New Deal Engagement in Fragile States, agreed in

Busan South Korea in 2011, was certainly a great step in that direction. Somalia fully embraced this agreement. Yet with all its strength, the New Deal for Fragile States needs improvement. That said, the mutual accountability principles embedded in the framework are exactly what fragile countries like us need. Often times, pledges are made, only to be neglected later. That should not happen as fragile countries rely on such support to rebuild their state. Conversely, development partners are often frustrated with the weak transparency and accountability institutions that exist in fragile countries. That is a legitimate concern, and we as fragile nations need to do better by tackling corruption and plugging leakages. Somalia has recently taken bold steps to address corruption. The AntiCorruption Bill, critical for putting in place measures for good governance and accountability has been approved by the cabinet and tabled for enactment by parliament. The leadership of my country has also reiterated its zero tolerance to corruption.
Also relating to funding, we must find predictable funding for non-UN peacekeeping missions. This is particularly true for AMISOM in

Somalia. For over a decade, they have registered tremendous success yet they continue to operate in uncertainty of funding each year. We believe that investment in peacekeeping is a worthy investment in peace-building and state-building and we have seen the dividends of this investment in Somalia. I look forward to engaging our partners on this matter in the coming weeks and months.
Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, Excellencies: A fundamental element of peace-building and state-building is how any country treats its marginalised and the voiceless. Women are crucial in decision making and investment in society. In spite of our many challenges, Somalia has made significant steps in this regard. During the 2016 election, the number of women in our bi-cameral Parliament increased from 14 percent to 24 percent. Although we missed our 30 percent target, we did improve markedly from a few years ago. Six months ago, when I was forming my Council of Ministers, I appointed six women to my Cabinet. They hold some of the most important portfolios in our nation, including trade and industry, health.

youth and sports, women and human rights and humanitarian affairs. In Somalia, women played an instrumental role during our worst times. In addition to being mothers and wives, they dominate the informal economy. Many living as refugees and migrants remain the lifeline of their families through remittances sent to Somalia. Similarly, youth are vital to peace-building and state-building. The number of youth in our Parliament has increased exponentially. And I have also appointed a number of very young people to key cabinet positions. One of them. Abbas Siraji, was tragically killed in May this year. He was a beacon of hope for Somalia's young people. Having grown up in the world's largest refugee camp in Kenya, he worked hard, studied, and worked for various UN agencies. I appointed him to the Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction at age 31. Although he is no longer with us, his appointment spurred the potential of thousands of young people across the country. He showed them that, life in the refugee camps, as harsh as it was, didn't mean the end of hope.
Distinguished Delegates, Excellencies:
10

One of the core tenets of this United Nations is human rights. We are working hard to ensure the respect for human rights of all people. The establishment of institutions such as the national human rights commission that is mandated to protect and promote human rights will
be a significant step towards in this direction. Vital legislations on human rights such as the soon to be approved Sexual Offences Bill, provide the tools to fight impunity of sexual perpetuators. Even though we are fond
of our traditions, it should never be a reason to condone impunity and my government is determined to find ways to harmonise our traditional dispute resolution and our conventional justice system in a manner that respects the human rights of its people.
Mr. President,
The United Nations continues to the worlds most important common
platform for nations to develop and strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations. It is a core UN principles for states to respect each others political independence sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is a
11

principle that should be promoted and upheld at all times, especially when engaging with fragile state such Somalia.
Mr President,
In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to add my voice to the reform process of the United Nations. This organization has worked for peace and stability for decades and I strongly believe that the Secretary General's reform agenda will most certainly lead to a far responsive and dynamic institution. As a country that has greatly benefited from the UN system, we have also seen that it can improve its overall efficiency.
With that, I would like to conclude by once again reminding all ofus, that we must redouble our efforts to focus on peace and decent life for a sustainable planet and that will take a collective recognition that, what happens in one comer of the world impacts another comer of the world.
Thank you, and may Allah bless you all.
12"
South_Africa,"Your Excellency Miroslav Lajck, President of the General Assembly; Your Excellency, Mr Antnio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations; Your Majesties; Your Excellencies; Distinguished Delegations;
Mr President, I wish to congratulate you on your election as the President of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly.
I assure you of South Africa's full support in the implementation of your priorities and responsibilities throughout your term. We also commend Mr Peter Thompson of Fiji for his exceptional leadership during the 71st session of the General Assembly.
I also wish to warmly congratulate Mr Antnio Guterres, on his appointment as the Secretary General of the United Nations.
1

We also congratulate Mr Ban Ki Moon on his successful tenure.
Mr President, You have chosen an appropriate theme for this debate, given the challenges facing the world today, namely; ""Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All On a Sustainable Planet"".
The theme encompasses the three pillars of the United Nations of peace and security, humanitarian affairs and human rights as well as socio-economic and sustainable development.
The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals two years ago, in order to continue the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, marked a significant shift and historic moment in the life of the United Nations. We all committed ourselves to address the challenges of poverty, underdevelopment and inequality.
However, a lot more still needs to be done to promote a more equal and just socioeconomic world order, so that we can achieve the SDGs.
The current structure of the global economy continues to deepen the divide between the global north and global south.
While a few enjoy the benefits of globalization, the majority of the peoples of the world still live in abject poverty and hunger, with no hope of ever improving their living conditions.
Even within the developed countries, the gap between rich and poor remains wide and is of serious concern.
2

We need the political will and commitment from global leaders to address the challenges and obstacles posed by this untransformed structure of the global economy, if we hope to achieve the goals and ambitions of Agenda 2030.
These unequal and unjust economic power relations manifest themselves sharply in Africa. For example, our continent is endowed with mineral resources, but it still has the highest number of least developed countries.
Many of the developed countries in the world continue to fuel their development from the resources of the African continent.
The continent also continues to lose a significant chunk of its resources through illicit financial outflows. Africa loses billions of dollars which would otherwise be utilized to develop the continent, and to provide for education, healthcare, housing and other critical basic needs for the African populations.
Money laundering, tax evasion and tax avoidance, corruption, and transfer pricing by multinational companies are some of the biggest challenges to economic growth and stability.
They undermine the integrity of the global financial system, efficient tax collection and equitable allocation of resources.
We appeal for the cooperation and commitment of every member state of the United Nations, and the International community at large to address this phenomenon.
Developed countries in particular, have a historic and moral obligation to contribute to achieving a fair global economic environment, and to eradicate the scourge of illicit financial flows from the continent.
3

The UN should also be at the centre of addressing this problem.
We, therefore welcome the UN General Assembly's adoption of the resolution on promoting International Cooperation to Combat Illicit Financial Flows, which is a preliminary step towards a global architecture to tackle the scourge and impacts of illicit financial flows.
Mr President, The issue of global peace and security continues to be one of the pillars of the UN's agenda.
South Africa reaffirms its commitment to cooperation between the United Nations and regional and sub-regional organizations, particularly the African Union, in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security. We welcome the continued support for the AU's efforts to resolve conflicts on the African Continent through promoting ""African solutions to African problems and challenges"".
As Africans we are doing everything possible to reach our goal of silencing the guns by 2020, as contained in our Agenda 2063, a Continental blue print for a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Africa. In this regard, we continue to make significant progress in resolving challenges of peace and security in our continent.
We hope that soon, the sister people of Libya will be able to live in peace and harmony, in a United and democratic country. In 2011, the African Union called for dialogue to resolve the crisis in Libya. Unfortunately, some among us here opted for guns and bombs.
4

Today, those countries are making little effort to promote stability in Libya. The major focus and preoccupation has become how to deal with the flow of migrants arriving in Europe from our continent and the Middle East, which are just mere symptoms.
The war in Libya contributed a great deal to the destabilization of the SAHEL region and all the way to Central Africa, creating a corridor for illicit trafficking in arms as well as terrorist activities.
In fact, had our warning been heeded that the supply of arms to civilians in Libya and the arming of civilians in Syria would cause loss of life, great instability and mayhem, the world would be more peaceful today. South Africa continues to call for an immediate end to the violence and for a Syrian led political transition and a negotiated settlement reflecting the will of the Syrian people.
In both instances of Libya and Syria, we strongly cautioned against seeking to resolve internal challenges of sovereign states by imposing foreign solutions through military means.
It is hoped that lessons will be learned from these tragic episodes in order to make the world a more peaceful place.
Mr President, We continue with our call for calm in the Korean Peninsula. The situation cannot be allowed to get out of hand.
As a country that voluntarily dismantled its nuclear weapons program, South Africa is of the firm view that there are no safe hands for Weapons of Mass Destruction.
5

The only viable solution to the problems of nuclear weapons is their total elimination as expressed in the recently UN adopted Treaty banning Nuclear Weapons. It can no longer be acceptable that some few countries keep arsenals and stockpiles of nuclear weapons as part of their strategic defense and security doctrine, while expecting others to remain at their mercy.
We are concerned that any possible accidental detonation would lead to a disaster of epic proportions.
We are making a clarion call to all Member States of the UN to sign and ratify the Ban Treaty in order to rid the World and humanity of these lethal Weapons of Mass Destruction.
We reaffirm, at the same time, the inalienable rights of states to peaceful uses of nuclear energy as reinforced in the Non Proliferation Treaty.
South Africa is today the biggest and proud producer of medical isotopes used in treatment of cancer patients globally. We will continue to harness the peaceful uses of atoms in addressing challenges of socio-economic development.
Mr President, As we stand here, the UN Security Council is paralyzed and is unable to carry out its Charter responsibilities for maintenance of International Peace and Security.
We remain steadfast in our call for the reform of this critical organ of the United Nations.
6

We hope that our Secretary General, working with the entire membership can provide some impetus to this long awaited ideal. Failure to do so will result in the UN irreversibly losing its legitimacy.
Mr President, We take this opportunity to express our empathy and solidarity with all the victims of the devastating hurricanes, monsoons, floods and drought as a result of the phenomenon of Climate change.
These phenomena are proof that Climate Change is real and that if we do not act now, future generations will suffer untold consequences. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a milestone in the history of efforts to address Climate Change and all its consequences. We should resist all efforts to unravel and undermine the Paris Agreement.
Our efforts should be directed at the mobilization of the required resources for its implementation.
Mr President, For South Africa this 72nd session of the General Assembly coincides with the centenary anniversary of Oliver Reginald Tambo, who led our liberation movement, the ANC, for three decades in the struggle against Apartheid and racism in South Africa.
OR Tambo travelled all over the continent of Africa and the globe, mobilizing international support for the struggle against racial discrimination and the oppressive Apartheid regime. He strongly believed in the role of multilateralism and the centrality of the UN.
7

It was for this reason that he spent a lot of time in the corridors and rooms of this UN building, mobilizing members to take a firm action against the Apartheid regime in South Africa.
As we celebrate what would have been OR Tambo's centenary birthday, we take this opportunity as a country once again, to thank the UN and the international community for support and solidarity for our struggle for liberation.
Mr President If OR Tambo were still alive today, he would have pleaded with this august organization to do all it can to support the struggle of the Palestinian People from occupation, and also to support the struggle of the people of Western Sahara.
The world has preached a two-state solution to the situation in Palestine, yet we have watched the expansion of illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
We appeal to the General Assembly that the same resolve shown in supporting the South African struggle for liberation should be shown towards ending the Apartheid practices against the people of Palestine. We also wish to remind the General Assembly that the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination continues to be undermined, challenged and denied. The United Nations must remain seized with this issue, for the benefit of the people of Western Sahara and the African aspirations of integration and peaceful coexistence.
I also wish to register South Africa's disappointment at the June 2017 decision of the US administration to reverse the progress that was registered in the past two years towards ending the Cuban blockade.
8

Mr President, South Africa stands ready to work with the UN to promote peace, human rights and sustainable development. As said by our liberation icon Oliver Reginald Tambo, ""We seek to live in peace with our neighbors and the peoples of the world in conditions of equality, mutual respect and equal advantage."" Mr President, I thank you.

South_Sudan,"Your Excellency Miroslav La.j&k, President of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly,
Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,
Honourable Ministers,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good Morning.
Mr. President, 1. I am honoured to give this statement on behalf of H.E. President Salva Kiir Mayardit, the President of the Republic of South Sudan who unfortunately could not be present here today due to pressing domestic commitments back home.

2. I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as President of this 72nd Session of the General Assembly. South Sudan affirms it commitment to play its role in supporting you as you lead this historic session.
3. ! would like also to take this opportunity to congratulate Hon. Antonio Guterres and his deputy Hon. Amina Mohammed for winning the confidence of this August House, South Sudan stands ready to cooperate and work closely with you.
Mr. President, 4. The theme that you have selected for this Session ""Focusing on People: striving for peace and a decent life for aft on a sustainable planet"", resonates very well with the aspirations of our nation for peace, unity, development and prosperity.
5. Your selected theme is in inline with the declaration of this year 2017, by H.E. President Salva Kiir Mayardit, as the ""Year of Peace and Prosperity."" This solemn declaration is intended to cement our resolve that the aspirations our people have fought long and hard for are realised. However, Realization of peace is greatly impeded with insufficient

resources. We commend the efforts of the IGAD, African Union and international partners to shun and isolate political actors that seek power through violence. We urge all stakeholders to continue embracing this common position and renew our commitments to further build on the progress that we have made to ensure that our people inherit a future that we always envisioned and aspired to.
6. Nonetheless, we do not wish to delude ourselves that peace, unity and development can be achieved overnight, but require relentless and concerted efforts, dedication and commitment by all partners, which we are pursuing willingly, consciously and vigorously.
7. We strongly befieve that 'peace is not a one day affair or event.' For us and our friendly partners in peace, there is simply no other viable alternative than making peace. Nonetheless, realisation of peace takes time. Attaining peace in South Sudan is a process, it requires our collective efforts. It is a consistent and persistent build up of positive steps towards achieving a world that we envision for the future generations in our country, in our continent and the world at large.
4

8. it is, therefore, against this background that the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGONU) has embraced the full implementation of the Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS) as the only instrument pivotal to achieving this mission and vision.
By way of updating this August House, allow me Mr. President, to highlight some of the important steps that our government has taken to further enhance the achievement of peace in our young country.
9. The TGONU continues to stand by its commitment to implement the unilateral ceasefire, which was announced by H.E. President Salva Kiir Mayardit in May 2017 with calls to estranged opposition groups to reciprocate this extension of an olive branch still ongoing.
10. With support from friendly partners, the government has embarked on implementing key aspects of the Transitional Security Arrangements such as the Security Sector Reform, Cantonment of

forces and training of Joint Integrated Police (JIP) in an effort to demilitarise our communities. We hope that the recently graduated JIP for Juba will be an example, that can be emulated in other security sector institutions especially through the overhaul and restructuring of the SPLA into a professional National
Army.
Mr. President,
11. The TGONU is spearheading grassroots intercommunal peace initiatives as ongoing communal conflicts characterised by cattle rustling, child abduction, high bride dowry and land disputes can be serious stumbling blocks to peace. It is absolutely important to find ways to transform the way our communities interact with each other and the international community should encourage and support government efforts and invest in efforts aimed at addressing these local conflicts, so that success stories can be replicated all over South Sudan at the different faces of dialogue. It is in this area that ! would like to highlight the role of young South Sudanese as either agents or detractors of peace. If I may use an example of how an inter communal feud,

charactedsed by cattle rustling and child abduction escaJated almost into an uncontrolled conflict simply because the youth from the different communities were incited to violence, makes us appreciate our collective effort in ensuring the situation in South Sudan can only be salvaged through no other means than embracing peace.
I wish also to highlight the important role that South
Sudanese women continue to play as peace builders and custodians of these inter-communal peace initiatives.
It is against this background that the TGONU, with the support of religious leaders, UNMISS, UNDP and other partners, is engaging in grassroots ""people to people"" peace by way of investing in improving the economic activities between communities like building markets, rehabilitating schools, constructing fishing storage facilities and peaceful disarmament of armed communities have improved relations between
warring communities, host communities and IDPs.
12. Currently in South Sudan, we are optimistic of the return of peace. Lately, we have witnessed

refugees and Internally Displaced Persons(IDP's) gradually voluntarily returning to their villages and several steps within communities indicating the direction of co-existing and living in harmony.
There will be challenges and reversals, but the big picture should be the direction of movement. We are very much open to listening to counsel and joint action but we also expect our partners to acknowledge and reciprocate progress, demonstrate some sense of respect and trust. An overtly confrontational approach risks creating a siege and bunker mentality. However, we are confident that soon violence and wars shall be stories of the past.
13. The National Dialogue Initiative (NDI), which was declared by H.E. President Saiva Kiir Mayardit, is making strong and steady progress with regards to
government's commitment to address a number of political and security issues with the view of creating an enabling environment for dialogue. Amongst others, major steps taken include: (1) release of prisoners including journalists, (2) expansion of the Steering Committee to include all the relevant stakeholders in the country, (3) ongoing reach-out to

opposition figures, and (4) declaration of unilateral cessation of hostilities.
14. The National Dialogue initiative, a process whose primary objective is promoting reconciliation and enhancing confidence in the peace process so as to not only make dialogue the only viable option to resolving conflict but also as a foundation to the National Constitutional Review process.
At this juncture, I would like to note that the steering committee of the National Dialogue has began to embark on engagement with all shades of political opinion,in particular those living outside South Sudan, in order to ensure that: (i) inclusivity in the national dialogue is achieved. (ii) the outcomes of the National Dialogue are reflective of all the components of South Sudanese Community. The Steering Committee is also engaging teams of resource persons who will go to all the states, counties, Payams and Bomas (localities) to organize meetings with representatives of the relevant groups to seek their views on the grievances held by their people, and to ensure that these are effectively addressed and corrected. The results of these discussions in the states shall be

reported to the Steering Committee, which will in turn present these to the larger National Dialogue Conference. The process will end with recommendations and resolutions that shall be presented to the national leadership under the presidency and to the national parliament for final adoption and implementation.
is. Our government is supportive of the efforts aimed at revitalizing the implementation of the peace agreement- We recently convened, in our capital Juba, a meeting of IGAD Council of Ministers to deliberate on ways to further expedite the preparation for the establishment of the High Level Revitalization Forum, which is envisaged to focus on practical ways to expedite the implementation of the peace
agreement.
16. Today South Sudan enjoys cordial relations with its neighbours. These countries, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda are: (1) hosting South Sudanese refugees, (2) providing corridors for humanitarian access and (3) supporting development projects, which further enhance the efforts of the TGONU to bring peace. We are dependent on these
3_0

good relations in order to revive and increase oil production; construct and maintain important road infrastructure; and provide electricity in the border towns, which are key ingredients for boosting the economy and work as incentives for peace.
17. On Abyei, our government reaffirms its willingness and readiness to implement the African Union High Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) Proposal of September 21st, 2012, which was accepted by H.E. President Salva Kiir Mayardit as presented by the Panel= We are hopeful that the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan will soon resume cooperation in implementing this proposal.
Mr. President, 18. ! would like to report to this August House that our government is cooperating with the
United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and facilitates the deployment of the Regional Protection Force (RPF). In the past few months we have witnessed the arrival of members of the advanced RPF as agreed with the United Nations. The government reaffirms its commitment to work closely
11

with the United Nations, AU and IGAD in seeing the smooth implementation and operationalization of the mandate of these troops in South Sudan.
19. The TGONU continues to work towards ensuring that humanitarian access to those in need is unhindered. This has been done through continuous and open dialogue with aid agencies and striving to have more humanitarian corridors opened up. With your permission Excellency, I wish to commend the concerted efforts of the various humanitarian agencies that positively responded and worked to reverse the famine situation in parts of South Sudan, and some gains not withstanding, I would like to urge that continued support is necessary in achieving a hunger free South Sudan. I would like to take this opportunity to express our condolences and prayers to the families of those humanitarian aid workers who lost their lives in the line of duty in South
Sudan.
20. While we appreciate that saving lives is important, we ought also save livelihoods. We cannot continue to clean the floor while the tap is open. The old paradigm that humanitarian intervention
12

first and development later is not a viable policy in the case of South Sudan. It is important to incentivise peace and stability through a balanced approach to development and embracing a new way of working. Stabilisation and Recovery initiatives are essential, and emergency support needs to be effectively complemented with some level of economic dynamism that provides new platform for social cohesion and resilience-building. As partners we all need to do business different. As government we will redouble our efforts to ensure access and improve the enabling environment for humanitarian intervention, it is our expectation that a smart combination and calibration of development and humanitarian support is needed to maintain the positive momentum.
21. Our ultimate goal and responsibility is to give an opportunity for peace to all South Sudanese which will enable them to choose their own leaders through free, fair and credible elections. Our focus for the remaining months of the transitional period, therefore, is to ensure that adequate preparation and creation of conducive environment for these elections are at the forefront of our priorities, and will see to it
13

peace is realised and that sufficient resources have been allocated in this regard.
Mr. President, 22. These efforts are core building blocks and prerequisites for boosting confidence among and within our communities, which will stimulate them to voluntarily and gradually return to their homes. I would like to reiterate our stand that we are of the opinion that these efforts can only be sustained 'ifand-only-if all political actors continue to respect and reciprocate the unilateral ceasefire declared by H.E. President Salva Kiir earlier this year.
23. Mr. President, the progress that we speak about can only be witnessed once we start to see progress in the reforms of the United Nations Security Council. It is an urgent task to realize the reforms of the United Nations Security Council, since the current composition and function of the Security Council does not reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century.
14

In order to achieve concrete progress on the Security Council reforms, it is imperative to launch text-based negotiations in the Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) during the 72nd session of the General Assembly.
24. In this regard, South Sudan wishes to add its voice in expressing its concerns regarding the rising tensions in the Korean Peninsula. South Sudan supports the call of the international community urging North Korea to fully comply with the relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches.
25. South Sudan urges North Korea to show sincere will and concrete actions towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
26. In regard to climate change, although South Sudan green house gas emissions are negligible, it is one of the worst Countries affected by climate change. The Country is experiencing recurring droughts and according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change it is the fastest warming Country in the region in terms of flooding, loss of
15

biodiversity and livelihoods. I am glad to inform this August House that South Sudan has ratified the Paris Agreement and has prepared its National Determined Contributions and National Adaptation Programme of Action to implement the projects embodied in both
documents.
Mr. President, 27. Allow me at this juncture to extend my appreciation to the member states of IGAD, the IGAD plus, the AU, TRIOKA, China, Japan and the broader international community for their support to the peace process and development in my country. While we appreciate that South Sudan, as a nation, cannot operate in isolation, the direction of the way forward must be ""South Sudanese-Led' and solutions ""home grown"" if we are genuinely striving to achieve sustainable results.
Long Live South Sudan! Long Live the United Nations!
i thank you, Mr. President.

Spain,"Mr. President ,
Mr. Secretary General,
Heads of State and Government,
Ladies and Gentlemen ,
Please allow me to first welcome the election of Miroslav l.ajcak as President of the Assembly and to wish him every success in his important role . This seventy-second session is the first during the term of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The Secretary General can count on Spain's unwavering support for his work.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Spain is eager to make meaningful contributions to a fairer and freer world , a world with greater solidarity.
This assertion of our compromise is particularly relevant following the barbaric terrorist attacks that were perpetrated in Barcelona and Cambrils on 17 August. From this platform I wish to express the sincere gratitude of the people of Spain for the multitude of heartfelt displays of support and affection we have received from around the world . Terrorism will be vanquished through unity , perseverance and the full weight of the law.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Spain is a free and open society. Our rights and freedoms are safeguarded by our Constitution, which stablishes a social and democratic rule of law system . The Spanish Government cannot and will not relinquish its defence of the rule of law and the values that underpin our political and legal system : freedom , equality, justice and political pluralism . Spain's public authorities have a duty to protect the rights and freedoms of all Spaniards. Any defiance of the rules of democracy is a grave assault on our peaceful and free coexistence. The act of pitting a supposed legitimacy against the constitutional rule of law inevitably leads to violations of fundamental rights of millions of citizens and is incompatible with the democratic system .
With the same conviction and determination with which we defend the constitutional rule and democracy in Spain , we do reaffirm the values , purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations . As His Majesty King Felipe VI said, standing at this very spot a year ago , the Charter ""not only lit up the dark days of the past, but also now lights up our present and our future "".
Mr. President,
Spain undertook our 2015-2016 term on the Security Council with a sense of responsibility. We made significant contributions in the fields of non-proliferation, the fight against terrorism and support for its victims, preventive diplomacy, the humanitarian agenda and also to increasing the Council's transparency. It is with this same dedication that we will serve on the Human Rights Council in the 2018-2020 term, should we be entrusted with this responsibility on 16 October. Defending and fostering human rights is a priority in Spain's foreign policy .
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The modern world is highly interdependent. Extreme poverty, hunger, desertification , global warming and protection of woodland and the oceans are all crucial, pressing challenges that require concerted efforts . Spain reaffirms its full commitment to Agenda
6

2030, from which we have drawn inspiration for our policies. We are preparing for the voluntary review of progress on the Agenda in July 2018 . The 2030 Agenda requires an enormous collective effort, to ensure that no one is left behind. We must work against inequality, promote prosperity and provide job opportunities to young people, in order for our planet to remain habitable for future generations . The future habitability of large areas of the world is inextricably linked to compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. We must act accordingly.
Mr. President,
Large displacements of people have reached unprecedented levels in recent years. The two Global Compacts on Refugees and Migrants that we have undertaken to adopt in 2018 should confirm the concerted, equitable and humane response to the phenomenon of refugees, contributing to the orderly management of migrant flows to the benefit of the countries of origin, transit and destination. Both phenomena deserve a differentiate attention.
Mr. President,
The scourge of war and threats to peace unfortunately still persist in many places the world over .
For seven years now we have been mentioning the conflict in Syria from this dais. We are comforted by the decline in hostilities and by the victories against Daesh, but we are still greatly concerned that individual interests are being placed before a political solution which, thanks to a UN's mediation, may lead to a genuine transition .
The UN is also playing a central role in promoting a political agreement in Yemen that will put an end to the world's most serious humanitarian crisis today.
In Iraq, the Iraqi government has been able to successfully recapture Mosul and other realms of terror from the hands of Daesh. Spain wishes to contribute to the new Iraq through , among other actions , the training of its security forces. Spain supports Iraq's reconstruction and reconciliation among its citizens, and rejects political ventures that detract efforts from the priority of consolidating a free, democratic and united Iraq.
In Lebanon, we welcome the recent renewal of UNIFIL's mandate, to which Spain's Armed Forces are contributing in a relevant way .
We trust that a rigorous compliance with the agreement with Iran will contribute to nuclear non-proliferation and peace in the region .
In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict it is necessary for the parties to recover the spirit of Madrid and come back to the negotiating table . The status quo is not sustainable. We are concerned by the trends we are observing on the ground, which are going against the two-State solution . Only two democratic States , living side by side, within secure and recognized borders would finally make it possible to meet the legitimate expectations of Israelis and Palestinians.
Spain has always given priority to the Mediterranean region , which we aim to make a space for peace and prosperity. To this end , it is crucial to encourage greater cooperation, such as that fostered by the Union for the Mediterranean.
Peace and prosperity in the Maghreb countries are of a particular interest to Spain .
My country welcomes the UNSG's declared intention to relaunch talks between the parties in the Western Sahara conflict. We trust that his new Personal Envoy will make it possible for them to move towards a political, fair, lasting and mutually acceptable solution
7

which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara , within a framework of provisions that are compatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
Also in Libya, the SG's new Special Representative has Spain's full support to contribute to a political solution for a united country on the basis of the Political Agreement.
Spain pays special and preferential attention to the Afr ican continent. Africa needs peace , stability, economic growth and solid institutions. We firmly believe in the potential of African countries , which will flou rish when conflicts end, peace becomes consolidated and social cohesion deepens.
Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia are two recent success stories that should lead the way for the other conflicts that are still ongoing in the continent. We reaffirm our conviction that the solution of these conflicts entails understanding them in thei r integrity and the cooperation in the pursuit of inclusive development solutions.
We are following with deep concern the situation in Mali, the Central African Republic and South Sudan . Here , I would like to pay tribute to the Blue Helmets who lost their Jives in these countries and in other United Nations missions. Spain has close ties with the Sahel countries. We want them to see Spain as a close neighbour, a country full of solidarity on which they can rely to combat terrorism and humanitarian crises such as that affecting Lake Chad.
We are concerned by the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . We call for respect for the constitutional provisions and for the dialogue in order to seek solutions, to lay the foundations for peaceful coexistence. Likewise , we call on the authorities of Burundi to act respons ibly and with respect for the constitution .
Since 2001 , the international community has invested significant resources to support Afghanistan, and last year it reaffirmed its commitment to that country. Spain deems it crucial to protect the promise of an Afghan society free from extremism and terrorism, respectful of human rights, including the rights of women and children .
Mr. Pres ident,
The nuclear and ballistic proliferation programmes of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea have become one of the principal threats to international peace. North Korea's renewal of nuclear and ballistic testing in January 2016 was in flagrant defiance of Council Resolutions, and severely undermines the international nuclear non-proliferation regime , to which Spain is fully committed . Spain once again reaffirms its call to the North Korean authorities to turn from a path that inevitably leads to the political and economic isolation of that country , and to sincerely embark on a way forward through substantive negotiations for a complete , irreversible, and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula .
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Latin America and the Caribbean are going through a period of deep changes in order to renew their institutions and search for mechanisms of integration. In this sense, we believe the Alliance for the Pacific is a successful model of political and economic coord ination , and that its dialogue with Mercosur opens a hopeful future for the region .
Spain welcomed with satisfaction the peace agreement reached in Colombia. We would like to actively contribute to peace-building. We have taken part in the UN Mission to supervise the abandonment of weapons, we are heartened by the positive development of this process and we are open to participating in the new Mission that will verify the
8

reintegration of FARC guerrillas, beginning on 26 September. Besides , we are accompanying as well the consolidation of the peace process through development actions we are promoting in the bilateral , European Union and multilateral levels. We also welcome the prospect of a cessation of hostilities with the ELN, and we offer to contribute to this effort.
Spain is as well a brother country of Venezuela's. Thus, Spain fervently desires for the Venezuelan people to live again in democracy, peace and freedom. We call upon its government to, within the context of the current regional efforts , carry out a real dialogue with the opposition , a dialogue respectful with the Constitutional framework, with the integrity and separation of powers , and of the human rights , leading to the liberation of all political prisoners , the celebration of fair and transparent elections, and the end of the humanitarian crises. It is about returning the Venezuelan people its voice. My country will not spare efforts to make this agreement a reality .
Mr. President,
Spain supports CICIG's (International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala) difficult and necessary work for strengthening the rule of law in Guatemala, and encourages the continuation of the cooperation between the Guatemalan authorities and the CICIG . We hope that the recent disagreements between both parties may be overcome through dialogue and conciliation. CICIG is an important tool supporting Guatemala to reach governability, the correct functioning of the institutions, the prosperity, the well-being of the Guatemalan people, and its contribution to Central-American integration.
The development and stabilization of Haiti represent as well a major objective for Spain . My country has participated in the UN Mission from its onset. We will continue supporting the United Nations' efforts in the new chapter opened by Security Council Resolution 2350 .
Mr. President,
The rule of law in the international sphere cannot allow breaches of the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. The annexation of Crimea represents a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in a clear transgression against international law. It is regrettable that such an act could occur in 21st-century Europe . We are also concerned by the persistence of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Its solution requires compliance with the Minsk agreements. The OSCE monitoring mission deserves all our support.
Mr. President,
The European Union is one of the most admirable legal and polit ical constructs to arise after the Second World War. It has brought Europe unprecedented peace and prosperity. The United Kingdom 's decision to leave the Union saddens us, but we will work so that the negotiations on a new relationship between the United Kingdom and the Union end with an agreement that preserves a close and fruitful relationship between both parties.
Mr. President,
In the context of Brexit , Spain has made a generous proposal to resolve the question of Gibraltar. It combines the unwavering claim of Spanish sovereignty over the colony , with a statute that benefits the Rock 's inhabitants so that they may continue to enjoy the advantages of EU membership . We invite the United Kingdom to negotiate an
9

agreement based on these assumptions , which puts an end to an anachronism that seems completely outlandish in the context of the excellent relations between our two countries. We must not let more time go by without fulfilling the United Nations mandate calling on us to negotiate the question of Gibraltar.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen , The Hispano-Roman philosopher Seneca wrote, ""It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that the y are difficult."" We have no choice but to dare to face, together and with determination, the problems that afflict us. With commitment, perseverance , and humility, we can make great progress. The road is long, and admits no delays . Let us make fulfilment of the San Francisco Charter's aspirations for peace, sustainable development, and human rights the imperative goal that guides our work during this session. Thank you very much , Mr. President
10"
Suriname,"Mr. President, Excellencies Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,
On behalf of His Excellency Desir Delano Bouterse, President of the Republic of Suriname, I wish to extend to Mr. Lajck congratulations on his election to preside over the General Assembly.
Suriname is grateful to the past Chair for his efforts in addressing the issues of the small and vulnerable states within the SIDS construct. We wish Mister Peter Thomson success in his new role as Special Envoy of the Secretary General on Oceans.
Mr. President,
Allow me to address critical issues related to the theme of this year's session, which are directly related to Suriname and the Region we belong to.
Natural disasters and Climate Change Suriname, Mr. President, cannot but give special attention to the extraordinary fashion in which the annual hurricane season has presented itself in the Caribbean. Our thoughts go out to the many families, the mothers, the children, the elderly and the sick who are living the worst possible nightmares!
We are convinced that those affected will be comforted with the hope that all is not lost, since the world community stands with them and pray for the betterment and speedy recovery of our Region.
We also acknowledge, the suffering in Mexico, as a result of the recent heavy earthquakes, and express our deep felt sympathy for those victimized.
Excellency, these events confront us with the relativity of human power and state power, whether unilateral or multilateral.
A quick review of the damage caused by the recent natural disasters, shows us the destruction of the means of production and physical infrastructure.
This, Mr. President, has created a social disruption that goes far beyond the immediate needs of the victimized societies!
We, also observe that the world at large, demonstrates a strong sense of solidarity when calamity strikes and humanitarian assistance is urgently needed.
However, to alleviate the desperate condition of the peoples, we must, in our international efforts, address the calamities in a further and wider perspective.
We must assist the respective Governments in restructuring the socio-economic and physical infrastructure, in a way, that these states can become more resilient and reduce their vulnerability in the future. This will require the development of innovative concepts and an intensive sharing of global experience! Combining forces at a global scale has become crucial.
1

Furthermore, it will imply aggressive mobilization of adequate resources. Such, necessary resource mobilization, will face obstacles. We will have to face the fact, that a number of the more affluent nations, entertain inward looking policies that do not augur well with the pressing need to join hands in solving these, truly global, problems.
The past weeks made it very clear to all of us that the forces of nature do not discriminate. President, no they don't and Suriname strongly supports the view that nations should proportionately contribute at a global scale if we want to survive as humanity!
When scientists indicate precise and foreseeable natural disasters, it is obvious that we should take precautionary measures, mitigate possible dangers and adapt existing structures to minimize the effect. Becoming more resilient remains the only way forward. It is in this regard unacceptable that Caribbean countries including Suriname are being graduated into Middle Income Countries, with a zero option to obtain concessional loans.
Mr. President, I add my voice to the lamentation regarding the fact that the vulnerability of these countries should be taken into account when classifications are applied.
Thus, it is ironic that Suriname is facing such threats of climate change, while at the same time our country is making a tremendous contribution in mitigating climate change. As a high-forested, low-deforestation country with 93% forest cover - which is the highest of the world - Suriname provides regulation services to the global climate, including as a carbon sink.
In addition to providing livelihoods to indigenous and tribal communities, our forests are biodiversity hotspots, with an impressive number of endemic and international significant species. Our forests also support fresh water regulation as part of the unique Amazon ecosystem, and provide employment and income generation through an active forest industry. Above all, we have set aside for conservation purposes, 1.6 million hectares of pristine rainforest, referred to as the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, as a gift to humanity.
While Suriname's greenhouse gas emissions have been historically negative, it is a challenge to enhance the country's economic development while maintaining this unique position in the world.
To achieve this goal, Suriname is ready to partner with Governments, the global community and other stakeholders to transform our economy, in which environmental protection, including through REDD+, social advancement and economic prosperity, take central stage. Our Multi Annual Development Plan, recently adopted by Parliament, is testimony to this vision for our nation's sustainable development.
Non-interference and non-intervention
On the issues of non- interference and non- intervention, Mr. President, I draw your attention to the following.
2

The natural disasters I just referred to, coincide with growing political conflicts which may well lead to a serious loss of human lives and the destruction of human achievements. A number of these conflicts are related to a stark disrespect for the basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations since 1945.
Non-interference in the affairs of sovereign states, and non-intervention are not empty principles. They are based on a firm belief that all peoples are equal and that the prevailing structures of government and democracy cannot be prescribed externally.
Recent interventions in the Middle-East have not created better societies. On the contrary, we have witnessed divided warring factions that can hardly be qualified as an improvement to the Governments that were ousted.
Suriname also has experienced the ill effects of interference in internal affairs. The destruction of infrastructure and means of production amounting to approximately 300 million US dollars, and much worse, is the fact that hundreds of children were deprived of access to education and proper health care.
Today, as a nation, we are still suffering from the results of the so-called foreign supported internal strife that disrupted societies in the interior, characterized by a socio-economic order that lasted for more than 300 years.
Suriname knows what interference means and the only way we have dealt with it, is by insisting on dialogue, resulting in the signing of the Peace Treaty in May 1992. So, when we tell the world that non-interference and non-intervention are principles to adhere to, at all cost, we are talking from our own experience.
Over almost three decades, Suriname's commitment to peace and development through the promotion of dialogue and the implementation of broad based social programs, remained in full accordance with the principles and guidelines of the UN. Dialogue in the spirit of mutual respect has led to peace and prosperity.
In this same vein, in 2012 the legislator passed an Amendment to the Amnesty Law of 1992. This, by applying amnesty to the full period of political violence in Suriname covering the period of 1980-1992. In doing so, the legislator complied with article 8 of the Constitution, which bans discrimination and guarantees equal rights to all citizens.
This amendment further provided for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, allowing for a clear distinction between politically motivated violence and criminal acts.
Mr. President, allow me to inform this gathering that in 2015 this road to peace and sustainable development of Suriname enjoyed full acceptance, noting that a greater majority elected the incumbent Government. Moreover, civil society has taken up the responsibility to advance the peace process through the implementation of initiatives contributing to the cause of truth finding and reconciliation.

Against the backdrop, Excellency, of the aforementioned developments, it is with concern that Suriname took note of the unverified and biased comments published by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers.
Therefore, Suriname categorically rejects the assertions of this special procedures mandate holder, who didn't provide the Government an opportunity to respond in a timely manner.
Mr. President,
The 71st General Assembly marked a milestone in the way the world views the 5 decades old unilateral Economic, Commercial and Financial Boycott against Cuba. Last year, there was not one state that voted against the resolution to bring a definite end to this unilateral decision that has proven to be unproductive from all angles.
However, the current reality obliges us to continue expressing our deepest concern, since we learned about the continuation of this detrimental and unilateral policy. Suriname therefore, with absolute respect for the sovereignty of each nation to determine its own policies, urges that constructive dialogue and cooperation must prevail, and that bridges must be built on the basis of equality and respect for independence and sovereignty.
Suriname rejects any measure that might strengthen the blockade, which is in violation of international law, the sovereignty of States, the principles of nonintervention in internal affairs and self-determination.
My Government reiterates the critical importance of these principles, and underscores the relevance of the processes of dialogue, diplomacy, peaceful resolution of conflicts and political and economic cooperation as building blocks for stability, peace and democracy in the Americas.
In this line of thought we encourage the U.N. Member States in general, and especially the South American and Caribbean States, to deal with the problems of our sister nation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in a constructive manner. Let us keep on stressing the need for dialogue between all parties. History proves that interference and intervention have never turned out successful!
Mr. President, Suriname is deeply concerned about the current developments in the Korean Peninsula. We believe that the interests of the Korean people must remain paramount in whatever configuration for a sustainable solution. First and foremost, the Korean people must be given guarantees that the use of violence can never be a solution for the problem.
Whether this originates in North Korea or elsewhere, the only remaining road to a sustainable solution will be dialogue and negotiations for the dignity and well-being of the Korean people in their struggle for peace and development.
The example of South America and the Caribbean in remaining a Nuclear Free Zone, could well serve as a model to be followed. The absence of nuclear weapons creates an environment conducive to dialogue and meaningful negotiations.

Tolerance and mutual respect as a condition for sustainable development
Mr. President
The global village is becoming ever more inter-dependent. Different cultures and ethnic orientations are rapidly becoming the basis for racial and global conflicts. Therefore, we have to find new paradigms to effectively limit the dogmatic adherence to religious and social concepts. Showing tolerance and mutual respect have become a must if we want to guarantee future generations' peace and sustainability.
The Government of Suriname is following the recent re-emergence of right wing extremism, framed in populism in many quarters of the world, not only with keen interest, but also with a certain degree of concern.
This development has the potential of putting the social cohesion within countries and bilateral relations between nations under severe pressure. Thereby affecting opportunities and the potential for cooperation.
Suriname has worked tirelessly to achieve national unity, which has resulted in a very diverse and well integrated society where tolerance forms one of the basic principles which underpins its very existence.
Thanks to the type of nation we have built, very disturbing and destabilizing factors such as right wing extremism, ethnic and religious intolerance cannot have or find a place in our nation, neither will it ever be able to take root and grow.
Suriname, today, enjoys an exceptional era of tolerance and mutual respect, with Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims and other religious denominations living in an atmosphere of peace and mutual respect.
Suriname, with roots from all continents of the world, has become, through intensive dialogue and mutual respect, a shining example of the importance of not entertaining supremacist concepts.
Therefore, the Government of Suriname is considered best positioned to understand and analyze the current global trend which needs to be reversed with immediate effect.
Suriname stands ready to share its experience and best practices with other sister nations on the issue of nation building, based on diversity, pluralism, integration and peace.
Then I am convinced that others will better understand one of the important motto's of Suriname: ""Diversity is Power"".
Socio-Economic challenges
My Government strongly believes, Excellency, that focusing on people is the quintessence of the application of power. Suriname is an example in kind.
As a nation, we have recently faced the ill effects of a largely commodity-based export economy. The sharp downturn in oil and gold prices in recent years--combined with the unfortunate closure of the century-old bauxite and alumina complex-- challenged Suriname's macroeconomic management since mid-2015.
5

By any international standards, Suriname faced a severe shock that was compounded on the balance of payments side, by the sharp increase in imports related to two major investment projects in oil and gold mining, that together accounted for about 35% of annual GDP.
We estimate that the economy contracted severely by more than 10 percent in 2016, requiring unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy adjustments and some temporary balance of payments support.
To stabilize the exchange rate, reduce domestic demand, and reestablish a viable balance of payments position, the monetary authorities sharply curtailed credit creation in the country, with credit to the private sector contracting in nominal terms.
Since October 2016, the exchange rate has stabilized, monthly inflation rates have fallen to less than one percent, and the country has returned to a current account surplus position.
Our macroeconomic response to the external and fiscal pressures started in earnest in August 2015 with a massive contraction in Government expenditure and increases in taxation.
The Government acknowledges that the extractive sector, producing gold, fossil fuels and other marketable minerals will remain critical for our economic development in the foreseeable future. We accept this reality, being fully aware that the wealth created must be deployed in financing a well-planned initiative to expand our economy in a sustainable manner.
With this objective in mind, the Government has recently adopted very important legislative measures. One, dealing with the establishment of a Sovereign Wealth and Stabilization Fund; the other, introduces the institutional framework which will facilitate Foreign Direct Investments.
As outlined in our Multi-Annual Development Plan, Suriname intents to strike a balance between the export of commodities on the one hand, and export of final products in sync with the services industry, on the other hand.
Mr. President,
Suriname acknowledges her citizens as the most important resource for its development. In spite of the challenging budgetary constraints, the socio-economic policies of the Government remained people oriented. The continued application of the Basic Health Care Law provides for proper health care for the entirety of our population.
In addition, as announced by President Bouterse, and as part of the Social Contract, adequate housing, access to education, youth participation, engagement and sports development, job creation, care for persons with disabilities and the elderly have remained priorities for sustainable development and growth!
In conclusion
6

Excellency, the message delivered by Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, assured us of his commitment to the theme of this year's meeting. Suriname pledges its full support and cooperation.
The implementation of the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in sync with the necessary reform of the United Nations, will carry a lot of weight. This will be a formidable challenge and, therefore, my Government believes that in addition to domestic resource mobilization, consideration must be given to accessible financing for development, capacity building, innovation and the transfer of technology for developing countries from a wide array of financing mechanisms.
Mr. President,
Having addressed these matters that are of vital importance for the survival of humanity, based on the principles of the United Nations, we bring to mind an Amerindian saying, that we have not inherited the Earth, but that we have the Earth on loan from future generations. It is up to us to give this wise saying its substance.
Mr. President, I wish in the final analysis, to underscore and reiterate the utmost importance of youth involvement and participation at the highest levels. In this regard, my Government has made it a priority to create the conditions for youth to be part of decision making processes. I refer to young people among others, as Innovators, Members of Parliament and Cabinet and as CEO's within what we refer to as the ""youth-adult partnership"". In fact, in 2010 our Government established a special Ministry responsible for Youth and Sport Development. It gives me pleasure to announce that this year, youth representatives are part of my official delegation to this 72nd session.
Furthermore, it is through political will that more women in our society can excel to the highest echelons of political decision making.
Mr. President, the 2030 Agenda envisages a world that guarantees all inhabitants of our planet, a climate conducive to self-development, of respect for human dignity, of tolerance towards other cultures and the ultimate goal of giving our planet the gift of diversity based on mutual respect.
Mr. President, finally,
It is up to each one of us, regardless of our status in society;
It is up to each nation whether big or small;
It is up to this multilateral organization to focus on People and strive for Peace and a Decent live for all on a Sustainable Planet. We owe it to ourselves, yes, we owe it to this and coming generations!
I thank you and God Bless you.

Swaziland,"Mr. President Miroslav Lajk, Your Excellencies, Heads of States and Government, United Nations Secretary-General Mr. Ant6nio Guterres, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr, Presidentf
Allow me to express our sincere congratulations to you on your election as the President of the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
We commend you for immediately identifying six overarching priorities for your tenure that touch on attaining peace, giving impetus to the SDGS, climate change commitments, equality and human rights for al!, among
others.
These priorities truly capture several of the current troublesome global challenges and we took forward to working c!osely with you on these issues.
The Kingdom of eSwatini would also like to commend the leadership of the new Secretary-General, who is committed to transforming the UN to be fit for the 21st century.
Mr, President
The reform of the United Nations and its attendant bodies has been discussed for a substantial period of time. My delegation believes that fresh impetus must be given to this process and tangible progress made.
We are therefore encouraged by the intentions of the Secretary-General to refocus our attention on the reform agenda. The reform of the Security Council is a key aspect of the process and no transformation could be complete without its fundamental change.
To this end, the Kingdom of eSwatini wishes to reiterate Africa's call for permanent membership to the Security Council in accordance with the Ezutwini Consensus.
The United Nations is urged to listen to the voice of millions of Africans who want to contribute to the welfare of the global community as equal partners.
We are confident that under the able leadership of the Secretary-General, the UN will scale to greater heights and support countries in implementing the 2030 agenda and the Paris Agreement.
1

The United Nations staff is also congratulated for their remarkable work in supporting inclusive and sustainable development, tackling diseases, promoting peace and stability and creating a conducive environment for mankind to live in, sometimes under extremely inimical conditions,
The theme of this session"" ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent mile for all on a sustainable planet"" resonates perfectly well with the motto of the Sustainable Development Goals of ""Leaving No One Behind'.
This theme is indeed cross-cutting in nature as it impacts every aspect of life, It calls upon all of us to work towards creating peaceful countries, continents and a sustainable worId where people can lead a peaceful and prosperous life.
In this vein, we wish to urge the UN member states to join hands in addressing the issue of nuclear threats that have the potential to disturb the world peace.
No country has the right to make the world an unsafe place to live and we owe it to our people and to future generations to put a stop to it.
Terrorism still remains a threat to the safety of our people in various parts of the world. It is a setback to key developmental issues that deserve the priority attention of the UN.
The Kingdom of eSwatini is committed to peace and a decent life for all. We are also firm believers in the principle of consultative decision-making. This involves a transparent and all-inclusive undertaking that grants every citizen an opportunity to voice their views in order to constructively contribute to the social, eccnomic, cultural and political development of the country.
Our country is committed to the SDGs as they provide a framework for development for the global community to strive for inclusive and sustainable development of our respective countries.
We have taken several initiatives for mainstreaming and localization of the SDGs through public awareness campaigns, consultations, education and training at all levels.
The Kingdom of eSwatini has also integrated the goals into the National Development Strategy which was revised to capture its linkages with the SDGs and the African Union Agenda 2063.
2

Appropriate institutional arrangements are now in place for proper monitoring of implementation of the goals at all levels.
Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for ""Urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"".
The urgency is now a global reafityand recent weather episodes such as hurricanes, floods and mudslides across the world have shown that no nation is immune from its impacts. The Kingdom of eSwatini is no exception.
The southern African countries, including our Kingdom, faced severe drought conditions in 2015/20!6. Its devastating effects, aggravated by the fall of the army worm, adversely affected crop production.
Funds from other projects and activities were diverted to mitigate the challenges.
The scale of the drought led the SADC region to declaring it a natural disaster. We are thankful to the UN, development partners, the international community, NGOs and other local organizations for supporting us during this period.
Government will continue with her programme of providing farming input subsidies to our farmers, The development of adequate water harvesting infrastructure to enhance food sufficiency will also remain a top priority for the country.
We urge donors and all nations, to not only fulfill their pledge towards the green fund, but to also adopt policies to strike the correct balance between production Of essential products and environment sustainability to protect and preserve the world for future generations,
Mr. President,
The net enrollment ratio in primary school increased significantly from 79.2% in 2000 to 97.7% in 2015 in the Kingdom.
This is a reflection of efforts by the country to ensure that all children have access to education irrespective of their socio-economic status,
Government provides for the needs of our children. Greater focus is placed on assisting those who are orphaned and vulnerable through various programmes

that ensure they too are able to access free primary school education and are provided with adequate nutrition through school feeding schemes.
In our quest to achieve a decent life for all, and in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Africa's Agenda 2063, the Kingdom of eSwatini has put in place several all-inclusive initiatives which are aimed at ensuring that no one is left: behind.
Government also provides grants to the elderly as a way of supplementing their livelihood.
The Kingdom is also developing innovation parks that will capacitate our young people with creative skills to enable them to contribute to the sustainable
development-of the country. "" .....................
We woutd like to forge partnerships with wefl-established ]nternationa! parks to leverage-and learn from their experience.
We have urged our private sector to take advantage of this initiative. We believe that this initiative, coupled with many others, will help nurture a future generation that is skilled and Well equipped to provide so}ut]ons to tackle the socio-economic challenges and youth unemployment facing our nation.
The Kingdom will be hosting the SADC University of Innovation and Technology. This institution is expected to produce highly skilled manpower and also provide solutions to transform economies thus enabling countries in the SADC region to meet their skills gap.
We seek the support of highly educated facilitators and the international community to make this project a reality.
Tackling poverty, hunger, disease burden and improving the basic standard of living of our people has been at the centre of our Vision 2022 and National Development Strategy.
The importance of human capital investment and promotion of the interests of vulnerable groups are a crucial step towards economic growth and prosperity.
]: have full confidence in the innovative and educated workforce that has demonstrated an indomitable spirit and resilience in overcoming the severe social, economic and environment challenges we have been confronted with in recent times.
4

As a result, ""Rising Above Adversity to Create Prosperity for All"" has been our national guiding theme for 20t7,
The critical importance of the demographic dividend to Africa's transformative development has been acknowledged by African leaders.
They have recognized the urgent need to accelerate the implementation of the African Union roadmap to harness the demographic dividend through investment in our youth.
The HIV and AIDS pandemic remains one of our priority areas as it continues to undermine our sustainable development objectives. It is stretching our health resources to the limit, calling for collective action by the government, international donors and other stakeholders to address it.
As a nation, we have taken a decision to attain an AIDS-free status in 2022, a vision that is in line with the global agenda to end AIDS by 2030.
Mr: President, we are happy to informthis august house of the positive results we have attained through our concerted policies in tackling this
scourge,
Key findings from the second Swaziland HIV Incidence Measurement Survey, SHIMS2, reveal that we have achieved more than 70% viral load suppression among adults living with HIV.
We have also achieved a major reduction of nearly half in HIV incidence between 2011 and 2016,
While we are encouraged by these results, we wit! continue to do everything within our ability to ensure that there are no new infections.
We are also happy to mention that our efforts to tackle malaria eradication is being recognized.
We are honoured that the African Heads of State and Government, during their AU Summit held in Addis Ababa in January 2017, elected us to be the chair to lead the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA).
Tomorrow we shall be having a side event for malaria here in the UN headquarters. Malaria is a scourge that requires .our concerted efforts to eradicate it from the face of the earth. We are aiming at partnering with our private sector in Africa and beyond to mobilize resources to combat it.
5

We appreciate the support from our partners and further appeal to financial institutions, development partners and donors to join us in this fight since it has handsome dividends for our populace in our beloved African continent.
Mr. PresideBtr
Among the political issues that have continued for too long is the continued denial of the right of the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to participate in the un system.
Taiwan has shown significant commitment to the ideals of the United Nations and has aligned her priorities with those of the organization. Humankind, -therefore, ha  16 to benefit from Taivan' experTehCe t0wards-our globai agenda as a member of the un.
t re-affirm the full commitment of the government of the Kingdom of e-Swatini towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals,
However, it is worth noting that while our goals may be universal, we do not all share the same capabilities and capacities for implementing them.
Hence, recognizing the resource and capacity constraints, there is a need for enhanced resources, capacity building, technology transfer and South-South Cooperation to support lower middle-income countries, along with LDC's, to achieve the ambitious and transformative agenda.
]: thank you - may the almighty god bless us all."
Sweden,"Mr President, Secretary-General, Excellencies,
In 1954, former Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjld, stated that ""the United Nations was not created to bring us to heaven, but to save us from hell"".
The need for a United Nations that seeks to save us from humanity's worst impulses remains. However, in these days of uncertainty we must also learn from - and build on - what is positive in our world, and in the United Nations.
In his important address on Tuesday, our Secretary-General laid out the threats and challenges we face; and how we can overcome them. Delivering a peaceful and prosperous future will depend on collective action.
This is the moment for multilateralism, not unilateralism. We must grasp it or risk the consequences.
The United Nations is at the centre of this effort. It is a tailor-made space for the world to find the solutions to the common challenges of our time. And, despite the, sometimes justified, criticisms, it is clear that we still believe in the United Nations' power. If we did not, Presidents, Prime Ministers, business and civil society leaders would not be here this week. I believe that we all recognise, that in the face of global challenges, `going it alone' is no longer an option.
1

The United Nations, founded to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to promote better standards of life in larger freedom, has prevented a repetition of the catastrophic wars that preceded its founding. Extreme poverty has fallen to an historic low. Life expectancy continues to climb. Millions of people are reached every year with life-saving humanitarian assistance.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustaining Peace Agenda are a powerful illustration of what we can achieve together.
These agreements are the strategies for our common future. We must now ensure that this organisation has the structure and tools needed to support countries' to deliver them.
The broad support for the Secretary-General's reform agenda illustrates the importance we attach to an effective United Nations, its role at the centre of multilateralism, and as a platform for the delivery of our common commitments.
The scope of the reforms being proposed by the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General reveals the complex task at hand. The Peace and Security Architecture must better prevent conflicts and sustain peace. The UN Development System must be radically reoriented to achieve the 2030 Agenda. And, to deliver these changes, modern management skills and systems will be essential.
More importantly, we must recognise that these reforms cannot be pursued in isolation from one another. People do not experience life in pieces. Their needs must be central. Peace and security, economic and social development, and the protection and promotion of human rights are mutually reinforcing  in responding, all pillars of the UN system, as well as our own bilateral efforts, must also be interlinked and mutually reinforcing. This calls for new ways of thinking and working.
2

Sweden fully subscribes to the principles for reform articulated by the SecretaryGeneral: a country-level and people centered perspective, gender-parity, decentralized responsibility and decision making, and reformed budget procedures.
Secretary-General Guterres, Deputy Secretary-General Mohammed, you have our full support for your efforts.
On our part, we, as member-states have a responsibility to act coherently, to avoid micro-management and to ensure long-term, stable and adequate financing. More flexible funding is necessary. We firmly believe in core and un-earmarked funding. We cannot allow ourselves to cherry pick to accommodate domestic interests; this will not give the organization the stability it needs.
I am proud to tell you that Sweden will increase our development cooperation budget by an approximately USD 350 million in 2018, bringing our budget to its highest ever level, and delivering on our commitment to devote 1% of gross national income to ODA. In addition, we will support the Secretary-General's efforts with kronor, as well as words, by making available additional flexible funding for reform.
In the immediate term, faced with record-levels of humanitarian need, the humanitarian system requires urgent funding to save lives and end suffering. In the longer term, investing in the 2030 Agenda and the sustaining peace agenda will build resilience.
Excellencies,
Let me focus now on three particular areas in the remainder of my remarks.
3

Firstly, nine months ago Sweden joined the UN Security Council. As the General Assembly elected us to the Council, it is only proper that I report back to you on what we have been doing on your behalf. Our approach to the Council is simple. While we each come with our national perspective, and while we will not always agree; as Council members, we are bound together by a responsibility to the charter and the world.
To this end, Sweden works with all members to deliver meaningful outcomes from the Council's discussions. We work closely with the other elected members, who represent the broader membership, and bring important perspectives. We are also talking with many of you, as part of our commitment to speak with countries on the Council's agenda, not only about them. Delivering real outcomes for those who need them is a responsibility that goes beyond our national interests.
And needs are growing. The number of major conflicts is on the rise. However, as the Secretary-General has said, neither war, nor peace, is inevitable. They result from the choices we make. Many of the conflicts on the Council's agenda have come about not because we failed to see them coming  the signs were there - but because we failed to respond early enough or quickly enough.
And, prevention means not only choosing to heed the warnings when they come, but investing in peaceful societies to avoid the causes of conflict emerging in the first place. As leaders within our communities, and as national leaders, we must choose peace, invest in peace, deliver peace. And, the UN system must be configured to support us.
4

Sweden has made conflict prevention a central pillar of our Council membership. We have underscored the need for the Council to recognise the primacy of politics in peacekeeping mandates, and the need for long term political strategies that aim to prevent conflict and sustain peace by addressing root causes. I believe we are making progress.
This is evidenced by the Council's support for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Gambia, for the peace process in Colombia and for the transitions in Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire, as well as its cooperation with the African Union to bring stability to Somalia.
As Chair of the Council's Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, Sweden has sought to strengthen the protection of children in conflict zones. Protection of children today, prevents conflicts tomorrow.
Nonetheless, we have more to do. The situation in Myanmar is a haunting example of where the seeds of conflict went unresolved, with tragic consequences. It is now urgent that the violence end, that the population be protected, that human rights be respected, and that dignified return be allowed. Humanitarian access is essential. Sweden supports the recommendations of the Annan Commission. We urge the Myanmar government to implement them without delay.
In Syria, prevention also failed. The price paid by the country and its citizens has been unimaginable and horrific. Sweden will continue to work through the Council for nationwide humanitarian access. And for a political solution, which is the only option for long-term peace and a better future for Syria.
5

In South Sudan, the civilian population has also borne the brunt of a nearly 4-year long devastating conflict. I welcome recent initiatives by South Sudan's neighbours. I urge the Government and all other parties to increase humanitarian access, to lay down their arms and engage in a meaningful process to end this conflict.
We continue our longstanding engagement in trying to advance the Middle East Peace Process. As the Secretary-General said during his recent visit to the region, the two-state-solution is the only way forward. Only a negotiated settlement between the parties and an end to the 50 years of occupation, can achieve this goal  Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security. We need to resolve this conflict once and for all. Doing so will have implications for peace that go beyond the holy land and the Middle East itself.
Perhaps the greatest threat to international peace and security is the unacceptable and repeated provocations by the DPRK in pursuit of a nuclear weapons programme. We call upon the DPRK to cease further testing, fulfil its international obligations, and turn to a path of sincere dialogue on de-nuclearization. All states must implement the measures decided upon by a united Security Council. Sanctions must be combined with political efforts to pave the way for a peaceful solution. We welcome the Secretary-General's pledge to make his good offices available to this end.
Excellencies,
Lasting peace requires the involvement of the entire population, meaning that the full, equal, and effective participation of women must be hardwired into all of our efforts towards sustaining peace. This brings me to my second point, Women, peace and security.
6

As a representative of the world's first feminist government, this issue is close to my heart. From speaking with many of you, I realise that I am far from alone in my strong conviction that women's participation in peace and security efforts is essential for sustainable peace.
Ensuring women's participation must be at the centre of the UN's reform efforts. Sweden is working tirelessly to put the Women, Peace and Security agenda into action in all aspects of the Council's work, from including gender reporting in mission mandates to adding listing criterion for sexual and gender-based violence in sanctions regimes.
Sweden's feminist foreign policy is an agenda for change aimed at increasing rights, representation and resources for all women and girls, based on the reality of their lives. We urge all countries to form their own feminist policy and to ensure that everyone, women, men, boys and girls are treated equally.
Excellencies,
My third, and last point, is our common responsibility for global development. The 2030 Agenda provides the pathways to achieve the peaceful, sustainable and equitable societies we want. All countries  rich and poor - share the responsibility of turning this promise into a reality for millions of people around the world. It will not be done by governments alone. All stakeholders from across society have a part to play. Ensuring that the UN Development System is transformed to support these efforts will be critical.
7

Measuring our progress against the Sustainable Development Goals will be essential both for decision making and accountability. Sweden has developed a set of national goals, linked to the SDGs and our national budget, which we are using to measure the development of our society.
As we all know, the strength of the 2030 Agenda is in the inherent interlinkages between all 17 goals. Each goal is equally important and interdependent; nonetheless, I would like to highlight two goals.
First, the goal of Reducing Inequality: Globalization has opened the world, strengthened economic growth and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. However, we have failed to spread the benefits of globalization equally. We must do better. As part of our contribution, in 2016, Sweden, together with an initial core group of states, business and trade unions, launched the Global Deal for Decent Work and Inclusive Growth. The Global Deal is a partnership developed with the ILO and the OECD with a focus on enhanced social dialogue and sound industrial relations, which are crucial to reducing inequality.
The second goal I would like to mention is that of Healthy Oceans and Seas. The oceans connect us all. Without water, there is no life. Therefore, the deteriorating condition of our oceans must ring alarm bells for us all. Sweden was pleased to cohost, with Fiji, The Ocean Conference that took place in June. The multi-stakeholder participation, and commitments made, highlighted the fact that saving the oceans will require all sectors of society to play their part  and that they are ready to do so.
The oceans are also affected by, and in return affect, our climate. We are already seeing the devastating impact of extreme weather events. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of such events. Left unchecked, climate change will wash away development gains and increase instability and conflict.
8

To those few that still doubt the overwhelming evidence that climate change is real, I ask: are you really willing to take the chance? Especially when we see that new technologies offer the opportunity to simultaneously reduce emissions and grow economies. Sweden is already proving this is possible and has set a goal of zero net greenhouse emissions by 2045.
All countries must join the effort to achieve the decisive transformations needed to reduce emissions and prevent the worse effects of climate change from happening. With 160 State Parties to the Paris Agreement so far, the global commitment remains strong.
Excellencies,
In his address on Tuesday, the Secretary-General told us ""We must act as one, because only together, as united nations, can we fulfil the promise of the Charter and advance human dignity for all.""
He is right. The expression that ""We are all in this together"" has perhaps never been so apt. As our world becomes more integrated, so do the challenges and threats we face. We cannot go it alone, we must stand together. Multilateralism is the only path to peace and prosperity.
Thank you.

Switzerland,"Working together for a strong UN  for the benefit of us all
Statement by the President of the Swiss Confederation, Son Excellence Doris Leuthard,
for the High-Level Week of the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, 19 September 2017
The spoken word is final!
President of the General Assembly Secretary-General Heads of State and Government Excellencies Ladies and Gentlemen Humanity has indeed made considerable progress since the beginning of this century in the fight against the worst evils in the world, such as hunger, extreme poverty and poor access to education. Nevertheless, there are still 795 million people going hungry, and every ten seconds a child dies of starvation and malnutrition. In addition, we face further challenges: climate change, global inequality, conflicts and humanitarian disasters, as well as forced displacement and migration. No country, no actor alone can find solutions to the challenges of today. They are simply too big; they are too complex; they do not stop at borders; and they concern the whole community of nations. We therefore need a forum where we can meet. We need a forum where we can develop solutions and monitor their implementation. We need an actor with the necessary legitimacy throughout the world to help implement solutions.

In other words, we need the UN, and we need a strong UN. That we are living at a time when this has to be re-affirmed is a warning sign! In order to maintain and strengthen the UN's ability to act, we need to make new investments. Switzerland is actively working to this end.
Investments in content are our top priority. It is important that the UN focus on issues that are of high relevance both now and in the future. In this respect the UN member states have taken decisive steps in recent years. I am thinking of the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Climate Agreement, and efforts to shift resources from post-conflict activities towards prevention  in order to sustain peace.
It is essential to drive implementation forward. The 2030 Agenda is a good example in this regard. Its success will be measured by what it achieves.
Important steps have also been taken within the UN. Switzerland especially welcomes the reforms that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is implementing in the three areas of peace and security, development, and management.
In the area of peace and security, Switzerland supports the Secretary-General's focus on prevention. The reason is clear: the cost of a conflict is a multiple of what it costs to prevent one  in humanitarian, economic and financial terms.
Human rights are a key factor in strengthening prevention. Switzerland therefore calls on all countries to support the `Appeal of 13th June', which aims to put human rights at the heart of conflict prevention. Reinforcing mediation capacities also strengthens conflict prevention. Furthermore, yesterday the High-Level Panel on Water and Peace initiated by Switzerland made recommendations here in New York on how water-related conflicts can be better prevented. The UN and regional organisations can make major contributions in this respect.
Switzerland is actively involved in efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons  the use of which would have disastrous humanitarian consequences  and to eliminate them completely. It firmly believes that a solution to the issue of nuclear weapons and security on the Korean peninsula can only be found through negotiations and a diplomatic process.
Trust is also an important aspect. Success in prevention requires the trust of the people concerned. For the UN, this means that a good partnership with the host state and its people is crucial. Sexual exploitation and abuse destroy such trust. Switzerland therefore supports the commitment of the Secretary-General to fight any form of sexual exploitation or abuse by UN staff in the field. As part of its commitment, Switzerland will make a contribution to the UN Trust Fund for victims of sexual exploitation and abuse.
In the area of development, we welcome the trend towards encouraging more joint initiatives by different UN agencies.
I would like to highlight two areas as examples of where we are confronted with major challenges: migration and digitalisation.
At the end of 2016, there were so many displaced people in the world as there had been at the end of the Second World War. Most of them are displaced within their own country. In Europe for instance, individual countries must agree on a solution to the migration issue that is based on solidarity and in Libya the political situation must be stabilised.

Switzerland is working to ensure that the Global Compact for Migration addresses at the international level not only the challenges but also the opportunities that migration entails. There is still a long way to go, and the willingness of every state is needed. We are pleased that we are able to make a concrete contribution to the success of this undertaking through the co-facilitation of the Global Compact for Migration by our permanent representative in New York.
Digitalisation is changing the world at an incredible pace. It also presents a huge opportunity. At the same time, it is a challenge that stretches across borders. Issues such as access to the internet for all, the impact of digitalisation on sustainable development, and cybersecurity must be jointly addressed. The 12th Internet Governance Forum, which Switzerland will host in December 2017, will provide us with the opportunity to discuss these issues.
In order to maintain the ability of the UN to act, we must also invest in processes. Because the UN not only stands out for the nature of its work but also for its way of working. A strong UN system means an efficient and modern UN system. For this purpose we need management reforms.
An especially important aspect of our interconnected world is dialogue. Dialogue needs time and commitment on all sides.
It must be broad-based and include all relevant actors. Climate protection, for example, demonstrates that political dialogue among states is not enough.
Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, clearly demonstrate that the Paris Climate Agreement must be rapidly implemented. Scientists have come to the conclusion that such events will become the new norm if action is not taken.
The private sector, in dialogue with scientists and policymakers, is working on solutions and is an essential factor for innovation, progress and development. Science diplomacy and an exchange with scientists will enable us to make the right decisions. As political decision-makers we must ensure our policies are evidence-based.
Switzerland firmly believes that investing in a well-functioning multilateral system  and especially in an effective and efficient UN  is worthwhile. In view of the challenges and the interconnectedness of the world today, going it alone is not an option.
Thank you for your attention."
Syrian_Arab_Republic,"President of the seventy-second session of the United Nations General Assembly,
I would liketo congratulate you on yourelection as president of the current session of the General Assembly and wish you all success. I would also like to thank your predecessor for his important role at the helm of the General Assembly during the previous session. I congratulate Mr. Antonio Guterres on his appointment as Secretary-General of the United Nations and wish him the best in carrying out his responsibilities in service of the principles and purposes of the
UN Charter.
Ladies and gentlemen,
As we meet again, our world is facing mounting challenges and dangers on a daily basis, and a persistent standoffbetween two sets of forces: forces that seek to control and dominate nations and their riches, by turning back the clock, re-establishing a unipolar world order, fueling chaos and war, and violating international and humanitarian laws; and opposite forces that work tirelessly to create a more balanced, secure, and just world, one that respects the sovereignty of states and the right of peoplesto exercise self-determination and build their own future.
As we meet again, many people continue to pay dearly and sacrifice their lives, security, stability and livelihood, as a result of the policies of certain countries. Those countries falsely believe that they could use terrorism as a tool to satisfy their greed and further their ill-conceived agendas, which do not serve the interests of any people, not even their own. No people has
suffered at the hands of terrorism more than the Syrian people, who, for six years now, has
fought against terrorists pouring from all over the world, supported by parties from the region
and beyond.

For more than six years, Syrians have endured the worst and have made great sacrifices to defend their coxmtry in the face of a terrorist war of unprecedented brutality, which has spared no one and no-thing, targeting irmocent people, services, the infrastructure and cultural heritage. Despite it all, Syria is determined, more than ever, to eradicate terrorism from every part of the country, without exception, thanks to the sacrifices of our army and the steadfastness of our people.
Mr. President,
Since the beginning of the war, our state policy has followed two main tracks: combating terrorism, and working hard towards a political solution that stems the bloodshed and restores stability.
On the counter-terrorism front, the Syrian Arab Army along with its supporting forces and allies are making daily achievements, clearing out territories and uprooting terrorists. However, the threat of this plague persists, claiming the lives of Syrians on a daily basis, and depleting the country's resources. We must all xmderstand that terrorism and the underlying Takfirist extremist ideology will continue to spread like a tumor throughout the world and haunt all of our people unless every one of us demonstrates a genuine will to cooperate to confront it together. Any such endeavor must respect the sovereignty of states and the interests of the people, and must let go of the illusion that terrorism can be used as a tool for political gains and
narrow interests.
On the political front, the Syrian government has spared no effort since the early months of the crisis to stop the bloodshed. The success of local reconciliations would not have been possible without the leadership's political support and the numerous amnesty decrees issued by President Bashar Al-Assad, which allowed everyone who had taken up arms to lay them down
and resume their normal life.

These successful reconciliations have allowed tens of thousands of IDPs and refugees to
go back home and helped improve the living conditions of a great number of Syrians who had fallen victim to terrorist crimes. Syria is determined to scale up reconciliation efforts, whenever possible, because it is the best means to alleviate the suffering of Syrians and restore stability and
normalcy.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Since day one, the Syrian government has positively considered all initiatives to put an end to the war. However, these initiatives eventually failed after states that supported and fuelled terrorism decided to persist in their aggressive policies against Syria and its people.
As for the Astana and Geneva tracks, the Syrian government has shown seriousness and commitment and has done its best to provide the necessary conditions for these efforts to succeed and achieve their goals.
We are encouraged by the Astana process and the resulting 'de-escalation zones' and hope that it will help us reach an actual cessation of hostilities and separate terrorist groups, such as ISIL, Al-Nusra and others, from those groups that have agreed to join the Astana process. This will be the real test of how committed and serious these groups and their 'Turkish' sponsors are. So far, Turkey under Erdogan has persisted in its aggressive policies against the Syrian people and has continued to labor under the illusion that terrorism will help serve its subversive agendas in Syria and the countries of the region. Turkey's position stands in stark contrast to the positive and constructive role played by Russia and Iran.
Notwithstanding its commitment to the memorandum on the 'de-escalation zones', Syria reserves the right to respond to any violation by the other party. Syria also stresses that these zones are a temporary arrangement that must not violate the territorial unity of Syria.
The Syrian government reaffirms its commitment to the Geneva process and further progress on that track. This process has yet to bear fhiit in the absence of a genuine national

opposition that can be a partner in Syria's future, and as countries with influence over the other party continue to block any meaningful progress.
Mr. President,
It is truly unfortunate that these countries that block a solution in Syria are members of this international organization, including permanent members of the Security Council.
The Syrian government has always insisted that any solution in Syria must respect Syria's non-negotiable principles, which are a red line for all Syrians. These include the complete rejection of terrorism, the territorial imity of Syria and its people, and the rejection of any external interference in political decisions regarding Syria's future. Only Syrians have the right to make such decisions, whether now or in the future.
Ladies and gentlemen,
For decades, Israel has continued its unscrupulous thuggish actions with full impunity. This usurper entity has occupied Arab territories in Palestine and the Golan for more than seventy years and has committed horrific crimes against innocent civilians. Israel did not stop there. It has publicly interfered in the Syrian crisis since its early days. Israel has provided all forms of support to Takfirist terrorist gangs, including funds, weapons, materiel, and communication equipment. Israel has also bombed Syrian Army positions to serve terrorist agendas. Coordination between the two was at its best when terrorist groups decided to target Syrian air defense assets used to defend Syria against Israeli aggression. The unlimited Israeli support to terrorists in Syria did not come as a surprise. After all, the two share the same interests and goals. However, let me be clear: It is delusional to believe, even for a moment, that the crisis in Syria will make us forget our inalienable right to recover the occupied Syrian Golan fully to
the lines of June 4, 1967.
For more than six years, states and parties that were behind the war on Syria, have continued to peddle lies and falsely accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons.

despite a confirmation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that Syria has fully eliminated its chemical program. This is enough proof that there is an ill-conceived intention to tarnish the real image of the Syrian government in the international public eye, and come up with new excuses to continue the aggression against Syria in favorof terrorists and their supporters. This was the case when the United States blatantly attacked the Shayrat airbase, claiming that it contained chemical weapons used in the alleged Khan Shaykhun attack. And as was the case alter every accusation of this kind, we confirmed our readiness to receive and cooperate with UN investigation teams.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Certain countries have boasted about fighting terrorism in Syria and having the interests of Syrians at heart. They have established 'coalitions' and held dozens of conferences under deceiving titles, such as 'fnends of the Syrian people'. It is quite ironic that those are the same countries that are shedding the blood of thousands of Syrians by supporting terrorists, bombing innocent civilians, and destroying their livelihoods.
The so-called 'International Coalition' led by the US, which was created three years ago to allegedly fight terrorist groups such as ISIL, has killed much more innocent Syrians, mostly women and children, than terrorists and has destroyed vital infrastructure that Syrians have worked for years to build. It has also used phosphorus bombs and other internationallyprohibited weapons before the eyes of the whole world.
We cannot understand the silence of the international community in the face of these crimes. The international community has not condemned or sought to stop these crimes, even though the Syrian government has made a number of appeals to the Security Council to assume its main responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. The Syrian government has urged the Council to implement its own resolutions on counter-terrorism, in particular resolution 2253, and prevent the Coalition from committing more crimes against the citizens of
my country.

Ladies and gentlemen,
While the coalition failed to make any meaningful progress against the terrorist group of ISIL, the Syrian Army, along with its allies and friends, has been able to secure real and significant gains and drive out terrorists from large parts of the Syrian Desert. In what was considered a strategic achievement, the Army was recently able to break the siege imposed on the city of Deir EZZor and its people by ISIL more than three years ago. This achievement will significantly improve the humanitarian situation in the city and contribute to the fight against terrorism in general.
We have declared more than once that it is impossible to combat terrorism without coordination with the Syrian government. This is the only way to make real gains in the war on terrorism. Any presence of foreign troops on Syrian grounds, without the consent of the government, is considered a form of occupation, a wanton aggression, and a flagrant violation of
international laws and the Charter of the United Nations.
Mr. President,
The war that the most powerful countries and terrorist groups are waging against Syria is not only a military war. It has taken other forms, no less brutal or aggressive, to break the will of the Sjoian people and punish it for its firm support of the Army in its efforts to defend Syria's political independence and territorial unity. For this reason, those countries have imposed a suffocating economic blockade on Syria, in blatant violation of international law, to destroy the livelihoods of Syrians and increase their suffering.
These unilateral coercive measures have been imposed on vital sectors, most notably health care services. Syria used to have an advanced health care system. Today, however, Sjrians are denied access to many types of medicine, even those used to treat life-threatening conditions, such as cancer. Such sanctions are a clear sign of the hypocrisy of certain countries that shed tears over Syrians while practicing a different form of terrorism.

The refugee problem is one of the consequences of terrorism. As Syria will need the efforts of every Syrian over the upcoming period, the Syrian government has made the retum of Syrians to their homes a top priority. To this end, the Syrian government has embarked on a mission to liberate and secure the areas occupied by terrorists and improve the basic living conditions of all Syrians.
Mr. President,
Given the United Nations' failure to uphold its own Charter and the principles of international law, we must all consider reforming this international organization to be able to effectivelyplay its role and to defend the legitimate rights against the law of the jungle that some are trying to impose.
Our nations yearn for a safer and more secure, stable and prosperous world. Such a world will remain a fantasy as long as certain countries believe that they can go around, spreading chaos, creating troubles and imposing their will with full impunity.
Ladies and gentlemen,
My country, along with its steadfast people and its brave army, supported by our loyal allies, is marching steadily towards the goal of rooting out terrorism. The liberation of Aleppo and Palmyra, the lifting of the siege of Deir Ezzor and the eradication of terrorism from many parts of Syria prove that victory is now within reach.
I am confident that, when this unjust war on Syria is over, the Syrian Army will go down in history as the Army that heroically defeated, along with its supporting forces and its allies, the terrorists that came to Syria from many countries and received large support from the most powerful countries of the world, including arms, funding, training, access and political cover.

Those terrorists have tried and failed to impose their backward ideology on a peaceful nation that
has been for decades a cradle of civilization.
The annals of history will recall for generations to come the achievements of the Syrian people and their steadfastness in the face of a barbaric terrorist campaign and unjust measures, which have compounded their suffering and deprived them of their basic needs. The Syrian people have stood their ground, against all odds, because they knew that this was a war that sought to eliminate their country, and with it, their own existence. They are an example to follow by any people who might face, now or in the future, similar attempts to break their will and deny them their freedom and sovereignty.
Thank you Mr. President."
Tajikistan,"Distinguished Mr. President, Distinguished Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished Delegates, Heads of State and Government, Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajcak on his election as President of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly and wish him every success in the implementation of his most noble duties.
May I also express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Peter Thomson for his continuous support of Tajikistan's national and international initiatives during his tenure of presidency at the 71st session of the UN General Assembly.
The dynamic processes of globalization over the past decades, on the one hand, contributed to the expansion of political and economic ties among countries, to integration among different regions of the world, and, on the other hand, brought about massive challenges to the people of the planet.
In this context, the concerted efforts of the UN member states at ensuring safe and peaceful life for the people have encountered serious obstacles.
In this regard, the United Nations, as a reputable and global institution is called upon to effectively continue carrying out its mission to coordinate consistent efforts of member states at responding to modern challenges and threats.
Mr. Chairman,
Under the circumstances, it is impossible to raise and address major issues of the day without a comprehensive reform of the United Nations.
The reform should contribute to enhancement of the UN capacity to timely and adequately respond to the developments around the world and to efficiently meet today's challenges and threats.
The principles of the UN reform should be in accord with the principles and goals of the UN Charter, including the UN Security Council as its main body.
We call for a broad and equitable representation in the UN Security Council, particularly of the developing countries.
Distinguished Participants,
Today we are witnessing horrific and tragic events that are taking place across the globe.
The spread of terrorism and extremism, armed inter-confessional conflicts, transnational organized crime, and illicit drug trafficking pose a serious threat to security of the countries.
Intensification of terrorist, extremist and other radical movements in the hotbeds of the world poses a threat to security of people on a planetary scale.
2

I wish to reiterate that the horror and brutal acts of these forces have nothing to do with holy religion Islam. On the contrary, they go against the moral teachings, tolerance and humanistic values of Islam.
Confronting these threats requires that all UN member states take stupendous efforts, in compliance with the international law, and refrain from double standards.
The Government of Tajikistan, continues taking consistent concrete steps to address threats and challenges, and to ensure peace and stability in the country, in cooperation with its partners and international organizations, particularly the relevant UN agencies,
Implementation of the second phase of the Tajik's National Strategy 2020 on counteracting terrorism and extremism is one of the effective instruments we use to carry out our commitments.
The UN central and coordinating role in development and implementation of timely measures for addressing conflicts in the hotbeds over the world has acquired a greater importance.
The success of our joint actions to prevent and resolve conflicts, to seek for peaceful ways of crises and disputes settlement, primarily depends on how effective we use the instruments of preventive diplomacy and mediation.
In this regard, Tajikistan believes that the problem of the Democratic Republic of Korea can be resolved through continued constructive negotiations, by peaceful means and within the framework of a bona fide implementation of the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.
We regard peace and stability as guarantors of sustainable social and economic development, dignified and peaceful life, creation of favorable conditions for further development of civil society, and observance and protection of human rights in each of UN member-states.
We, Tajiks, are well aware of the value of peace and the need to defend it. Our people experienced numerous hardships in the first years of the country's independence. As a result of the imposed civil conflict thousands of citizens of our country lost their lives.
Only through peace and stability in the society we had been able to achieve sustainable economic development, reduce poverty and improve people's well being.
On this basis, by promoting multilateral and mutually advantageous cooperation with many countries of the world we undertook the necessary steps to ensure regional integration.
Mr. Chairman, We cannot remain indifferent to the military, political, and socio- economic situation in
the neighboring Afghanistan, which raises our grave concern.
Today it is obvious that sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan are key to ensuring stability and security in Central and South Asia and other neighboring regions.
In this regard, we consider it essential that the international community continue coordinate its efforts and adopt effective measures for a comprehensive resolution of the Afghan problem.
In this regard, it is important to get Afghanistan involved in the process of regional integration through strengthening economic and trade relations with this country.
We call on the international community to render targeted assistance and support to Afghanistan in restoring its social and economic life and developing transportation and communication infrastructure.
3

Tajikistan, which shares 1400 kilometers of border with Afghanistan is willing to make its contribution to this honorable endeavor.
Transport and road connectivity of both countries, implementation of power transmission lines' projects, including CASA-1000, training and professional development of experts in different areas, these are just a few areas, which are currently in the focus of Tajikistan's attention.
Combating illicit drug trafficking, which is among the main sources of funding international terrorism, needs joint efforts of the international community, regional and international organizations.
To this end, Tajikistan has established efficient cooperation with the relevant UN agencies, regional organizations, as well as with partner countries at the bilateral level.
Currently, the National Strategy 2020 on combating illicit drug trafficking is being successfully implemented in the country.
Mr. Chairman,
Adoption of 2030 Agenda by the international community is a milestone for sustainable development and involves all sectors of society to this process.
Tajikistan over the past years made a great stride towards implementation of Sustainable Development Goals.
The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, in cooperation with the relevant UN agencies, has developed and adopted a Mid-Term Development Strategy 2020 and National Development Strategy 2030.
The strategies have been developed in line with the Global agenda on sustainable development, and we believe that their timely and effective implementation will contribute to the achievement of the global Sustainable Development Agenda.
Tajikistan was among 44 countries, which presented their Voluntary National Review last July during the High Level Political Forum on sustainable development.
To ensure successful implementation of Agenda 2030 it is necessary to help least developed and developing countries to participate through providing support especially in the area of financial support and advanced technologies. In our opinion, increasing Official Development Assistance still remains one of the main issues of the day.
It is worth mentioning that geographical location of the land locked developing countries and lack of access to sea pose serious obstacles to their sustainable development.
In such circumstances, these countries need much more assistance of developed countries and international financial institutions in their efforts to develop infrastructure, to improve transit transport systems, simplify trade policies and regional integration.
For this reason, joint global development requires comprehensible partnership at all levels.
In this regard, the UN bodies especially the Economic and Social Council, can and should also play an important role.
We also call on the developed countries and international structures to ensure favorable conditions for labor migrants in receiving states and support the countries of origin in creating new jobs.
We are convinced that greater focus on urgent economic, social and ecological issues would contribute to the timely implementation of 2030 Agenda.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
4

Two years ago we adopted the Paris Climate Agreement, whose comprehensive goals and targets identify obligations and efforts of the international community at adaptation to the climate change and transition to a ""green"" economy.
Regrettably, as a result of climate change the number of natural disasters is on the rise in dozens of countries around the world, and not all of them have the capacity to ensure relevant protective measures.
In this regard, we suggest to enhance the mechanisms for providing comprehensive assistance to the countries affected by the natural disasters, and to this end, establish international and regional funds.
With 93 percent of its territory covered by mountains, Tajikistan, due to its geographical location, also remains vulnerable to destructive consequences of natural disasters.
Every year our country witnesses various kinds of natural disasters, including those related to water that cause damage to the national economy worth hundreds of millions US dollars, and claim human lives.
Climate change accelerates melting of glaciers that brings about the rise of water level in rivers, which, in its turn, has a negative impact on the main sectors of national economy, particularly, hydro energy, agriculture and industry.
In Tajikistan over the last 30 years, more than 1,000 glaciers out of the total 13 thousand, have already degraded.
And this happens at the time when the capacity of Tajikistan to use industry - the main source of carbon dioxide emission- is not that huge, and 98 percent of the country's energy is produced at hydroelectric power stations that generate environmentally sound energy.
Currently, 60 percent of the Central Asia water resources are formed on the territory of Tajikistan.
This means that the continued acceleration of glaciers melting can negatively affect the process of water resources formation in the region.
In this regard, time has come for us to translate words into actions and implement the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Based on this Agreement Tajikistan is currently developing National Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change.
In our opinion, at this stage, one of the ways to achieve the Paris Agreement goals is to adhere to the recommendation of the ""pure"" economy and efficient use of renewable energy sources.
In this context, we reiterate our commitment to the global initiatives ""Sustainable Energy for All"" and the International Decade ""Sustainable Energy 2014- 2024""
Mr. President,
Tajikistan is strongly committed to continue its contribution to the implementation of the UN water agenda.
It is with great delight I note that in December 2016, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus the Resolution entitled ""International Decade of Action ""Water for Sustainable Development, 2018-2028"".
We are confident that an implementation of the new Decade at the national, regional and international levels will contribute to the achievement of the water-related sustainable development goals and will help to preserve this invaluable resource for future generations.
This morning, we have conducted a High-level Event, entitled ""Towards Implementation of the International Decade of Action ""Water for Sustainable Development"", 2018-2028 at the
5

UN Headquarters, where participants exchanged their views on effective ways and mechanisms for advancement of the new International Decade and achieving the SDG-6 .
Furthermore, in order to review and deliberate on proposals and adopt Action Plan for the Decade, we intend to organize on World Water Day, 22 March 2018, in New York a special event on the occasion of launching the International Decade for Action ""Water for Sustainable Development, 2018-2028"", and host a High-level International Conference on Water for Sustainable Development in Dushanbe next June.
We have a strong conviction that UN member states, international and regional organizations, international financial institutions, civil society, think tank organizations, women and youth will work together to implement the goals and objectives of the Decade to ensure dignified life of the people around the globe and for a better, safer and more secure life of future generations.
Thank you for your attention.

Thailand,"Mr. President,

/

1. I am sure I speak on behalf of everyone here that our hearts and prayers are

witti everyone in the Caribbean now facing the devastating effects of hurricanes,

especially in Dominica and Puerto Rico. Our prayers are also with people of

 Mexico in the aftermath of the deadly earthquake on Tuesday.

Mr. President,

2. Over the past few days, the words ""we the peoples"" have been echoed in this august assembly many times. Thailand shares the view of Secretary General Guterres and many member states that we need to focus more on the people and less on bureaucracy. The United Nations must be less about debates but more about actions and can truly impact changes on the ground.

3. At the General Assembly this year, it is gratifying to hear world leaders focusing on people. Indeed, the life, survival, 'ond prosperity of a nation depend on the quality of life of its people. When people live decent lives, they thrive, and in turn nations and our planet prosper. On the other hand, if people are still struggling with their daily lives, having nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, no schooling or healthcare access, then the advancement of nations would be an unrealizable ambition. That is why we must focus on people.

4. In fact, we have long focused on the people in Thailand. Our Late King, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, told us to listen to the people and to learn from them. He said that those living in the community know best about their conditions and needs. Development must not be top-down but bottom-up, and must vary according to specific contexts. His Majesty laid the groundwork on this people-centered approach through the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP), which stresses self-development and places emphasis on everyone's potential to mold one's own furore and live in harmony with nature. When each person can contribute meaningfully to his or her community, the life of the nation will surely begood.

-2-
5. Based on the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, the Royal Thai Government envisions the lives of our people and the life of our nation to become ""Stable, Prosperous, and Sustainable"". Our key national frameworks, namely the 2017 Constitution, the 20-Year National Strategy Framework, the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan have all been formulated to focus first on people. Thailand has stepped up efforts to put in place a decentralized areabased development policy to empower those who will be affected and create a space to appreciate local wisdom and knowledge.
6. At the same time, Thailand is seeking to utilize Science, Technology, and Innovation to strengthen human capability and foster an enabling environment in our development paradigm. Currently, we aim to build a value-based economy under the ""Thailand 4.0"" policy. The value-based economy encompasses a circular economy, in which resources are utilized efficiently and in an environmentally friendly manner; a distributive economy where development is inclusive; and an innovative economy where growth springs from ideas and knowledge. This value-based economy under Thailand 4.0 requires human wisdom even more than high technology. And that is why we are focusing on our people and putting human life cycle development as our priority.
7. Since 2002, we have successfully embarked upon our Universal Health Coverage System (UHC). UHC is an investment in our people and our future. At present, 99.87 per cent of the population enjoys some kind of health coverage. The UHC has helped prevent over !00,000 households from falling into poverty over the past decade. As Chair of the Foreign Policy and Global Health Initiative, Thailand will present a draft resolution at this UNGA session to mark 12 December as World UHC Day. We hope to receive support from member states in this regard.
8. Another recent example of how we focus on people is our National Strategy on Elimination of HIV/AIDs (2017-2030). By 2030, Thailand aims to reduce new HIV infections, reduce HIV/AIDs related deaths, and cut down discrimination related to HIV and gender. We are also proud to say that in 2016 the World Health Organization recognized Thailand as the first country in Asia and second country in the world to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.
Mr. President,
9. The world is going through a critical time, facing a series of common challenges, such as extremism, terrorism, ongoing conflicts, and irregular migration, along with environmental degradation, climate change, and natural disasters. Another grave concern is the nuclear threat which is looming over us and feels more realnow than ever before. It is at times like these that humanity is being truly tested.

3
10.Two days ago Thailand signed and deposited our instrument of ratification to the Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty. We are proud to be among the first countries to do so. We wish to call on others to do the same. By doing so, we are sending out our message to our children and grandchildren that we do care.
Mr. President,
11. Thailand shares the international community's grave concern over the situation in the Korean Peninsula, and the recent nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK. We encourage all parties to find a peaceful solution, along with full implementation of UNSC Resolutions.
12. Thailand is also deeply concerned about ongoing violence and conflicts elsewhere in the world. And as a neighboring country, Thailand cannot turn blind eyes to the situation in the Rakhine State, which recently forced hundreds of thousands to leave their homes. We are fully aware of the complexities of these humanitarian situations that cannot be solved overnight. These situations call for long-term political and socio-economic solutions. Sustaining peace and sustaining development must go hand in hand.
Mr. President,
13. To enable people to have decent lives, we must build inclusive societies where every person has a sense of belonging and feel that their voices are heard and their views counted. We must empower the most vulnerable in our societies those suffering in poverty, women, children, persons with disabilities - and leave no one behind. Their rights and dignity must be respected. They must be protected by law and have equal access to justice. Only then can we realize a truly inclusive society with sustainable peace and development.
Mr. President,
14. Multilateralism and the United Nations, in particular, have a great role to play in fostering the quality of our people's lives. The United Nations must take transformative steps to live up to today's reality and expectations. Development programs, financial and technical assistance, peace operations, security sanctions, resource mobilization, environmental protection programs - all of these must truly enhance the quality of life of the people.
15. The work of the United Nations must have real impact on the ground. The United Nations must be able to identify challenges based on the needs and particular situations of each country, and must be able to adapt its work in a responsive and flexible manner. It must also address the root cause of each problem, especially by addressing structural gaps and working more on prevention, rather than only curing the symptoms.

16.We look forward to hearing more details on the UN Development System reform, and how it would impact changes on the ground, enhance resource efficiency, and synergize works of regional commissions and UN country teams. We also wish to hear about innovative resource mobilization and enhanced partnerships with all stakeholders, especially the private sector, academia, and civil society. Partnerships, particularly with Science, Technology, and Innovation communities would bring about the transformative push required for achieving SDGs.
17. We must learn to mobilize the diverse strengths of each and every one of us. We must ensure that local wisdom and community knowledge are appreciated and integrated into our efforts. We must create a culture of partnerships based on mutual trust and respect.
18. On our part, Thailand recognizes and appreciates the diversity of strengths of each stakeholder. We value the sharing of knowledge and experiences. It is in this spirit that Thailand has lmmched the ""SEP for SDGs Partnership"" to encourage the sharing of theSufficiency Economy Philosophy in advancing SDGs. As part of our efforts to promote South-South cooperation, last year, Thailand supported the reopening of the UN Office for the South-South Cooperation for Asia and the Pacific in Thailand and has provided human resources to the Office.
Mr. President,
19. Last but not least, focusing on the people is not only about working on external conditions. The first step of a successful transformation is to work on the mindsets, especially of children and youth. We must not forget them. Their voices must be heard. The future belongs to them. Therefore, we iiaust ensure that children today grow up to become citizens of the world with global mindsets.
20. Everyone can be an agent of change. If one can have a decent life, feeling content with what one has, eventually that person will want to give and to share. Our role as governments, Mr. President; is to support the people, creating an enabling environment for them to be able to give and to share, and let the people driveihe change.
21. I thank you, Mr. President."
Timor-Leste,"Excellencies, Mister President of the UN General Assembly Mister Secretary General of the United Nations
I extend my congratulations to Mr President Miroslav Lajk on his election by the General Assembly as well as my best wishes of success, and I salute the outgoing president Peter Thomson for his leadership in conducting the work of the 71st session.
We, the United Nations
It is a happy coincidence that I was given the opportunity to address this General Assembly today- on this very same day, 18 years ago, the first Australian and New Zealand personnel of the INTERFET, the International Force in East Timor, arrived in my country, occupied at the time. The arrival of that UN-mandated force on 20 September 1999 put an end to the bloodshed and paved the way for us to attain national independence voted for the majority of the Timorese people at the referendum for self-determination held under the supervision of the United Nations, pursuant to international law.
On behalf of the Timorese people, I reiterate my heartfelt gratitude to the United Nations and to all civilians and servicemen who, under the flag of the United Nations, protect innocents and, ultimately, save lives.
Another happy coincidence - though rare- is that among us here today is another key player in the process that led the international community and the UN to shoulder their long deferred responsibilities for the self-determination of the Timorese people. The key player I'm talking about is Secretary General Ant6nio Guterres. As Prime Minister of Portugal, the action of Antonio Guterres, guided by values and ethical imperatives, was decisive for Timor-Leste to be considered today a success story - a joint success of the Timorese and the United Nations - as others have pointed out several times in recent years.
Values of the international community
I warmly welcome the theme of the General Assembly, 'Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life [or All on a Sustainable Planet'. These are, without a doubt, tasks for our generation. Allow me to assure you that Secretary General Ant6nio Guterres is the right man to promote and inspire the beginning of this common path whose success depends on the intense commitment of us all.
The recent history of Timor-Leste vividly reminds us that when civil values, on which the very existence of the United Nations is built, take the lead - and inspire decisions - in the international scene, the UN and international law become powerful and decisive forces to settle conflicts and restore peace. Portugal's action in the 1990s, combined in 1998 and 1999 with the action of the governments of Indonesia, Australia, and the United States, and the

3
support of the European Union and other world powers, were living proof of the United Nations' ability to save lives and help make the world a safe place. The stability of the international scene is a function of the respect for International Law.
The UN and Timor-Leste have benefited from extraordinary individuals. I recall and salute lan Martin; and I evoke the memory of the Special Representative of the Secretary General in Dili between 1999 and 2002, our dearly departed friend and brother Srgio Vieira de Mello. The sensibility and competence, the capacity for dialogue and political achievement of these and of a few other leaders made it possible for us to achieve together better results despite the trail of unprecedented devastation found in the country when it became ours. The nature of leadership is important for the unfolding of the political and social processes - and can be decisive for success, The professional and human qualities of our dearly departed Sergio Vieira de Mello - diplomat and leader - must continue to inspire us on a daily basis so that the UN does not fail to meet the heartfelt yearnings for stability and development opportunities of many peoples around the world.
The first 15 years
Timor-Leste celebrates this year the 15th anniversary of the Restoration of Independence which tool< place on 20 May 2002. Over these last fifteen years, the partnerships we have established with the UN, their specialised agencies and development partners have led to important and inspiring results, i'm afraid I do not have the time to expand further on this topic. I will only say that over these last years we have achieved what few thought possible:
The mortality rates of infants and children under the age of five have dropped by half. According to the World Health Organization, Timor-Leste managed to reduce malaria incidence from 220 in 1,000 cases (2006) to i in 1,000 - including cases registered in remote areas. In 2002 there were 19 doctors in Timor-Leste. Today we have nearly 1,000 trained by the solidarity-based cooperation of the people and the government of Cuba. There are doctors in every village of Timor-Lesteand several new hospitals. My country was declared leprosy-free by the WHO for the first time in centuries.
And last, in 2002 life expectancy at birth was 60 years. Today it is 68 and a half. The progress made in several areas was acknowledged by the distinguished medical journal The Lancet which ranked Timor-Leste as the country that has made the most progress since 2000 when it comes to the Sustainable Development Goals.
We consider Education, as is the case with Healthcare, a key priority. The enrolment rates in primary education stands at nearly 100% of school-age children and youths. We have recently introduced a new curriculum at primary education level and have given priority to the construction of new schools and the improvement of school equipment, in particular in recent years. The guiding thread of these and many other measures is the improvement of the quality of public schools.

4
The progress we made has translated into the human development index reported by the UNDP, the United Nations Development Programme: over the past 6 years, this index reached on average O.610. In 2002 it was 0.375.
International Integration
The most important achievement of the Timorese people over the course of these 15 yearsthe foundation of other achievements - was peacebuilding and reconciliation at both national and international levels. Peace and reconciliation were made possible by the vision of the national leaders, by the courage to reject vengeance and by the genuine adherence of Timorese society as a whole to this vision.
We have established solid relations of friendship and intense cooperation with Indonesia and Australia; we are working towards further strengthening our relations with neighbouring ASEAN countries, the association to which we have submitted our application for membership. The strengthening of Timor-Leste's regional integration is a key priority of our foreign policy. I rejoice at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of ASEAN and salute this association for its decisive contribution towards transforming Southeast Asia into a safer, stable, more democratic and prosperous region, ranking amongst the highest growth rates in the world and offering increased well-being to the peoples in the region.
Sustainable development
In Timor-Leste, now that peace and stability have been achieved, we are putting our efforts into creating better conditions for economic and social development. This includes, namely, improving the development conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises and the private sector in general, and promoting the diversification of the non-oil economy.
The goal that we have set for ourselves in our Strategic Development Plan, approved in 2011, is that by 2030 'Timor-Leste will have joined the ranks of upper middle income countries, eradicated extreme poverty and established a sustainable and diversified non-oil economy'. This is the plan that we are putting into action.
In fact, our goals converge with the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015, to whose definition we actively contributed as well.
g7+ and the priority of strong institutions
We believe that a key condition for the development of the country is the existence of stability and solid institutions, providing quality public services. This is why my country proposed the inclusion of 'quality institutions' among the Sustainable Development Goals. Timor-Leste's proposal was accepted and it became the 16th SDG - ""Peoce, Justice ond Strong Institutions"".
The relationship between quality institutions and development is, for us, an old priority, which

5
translated into Timor-Leste's commitment to the creation of the 'g7 plus' group since 2009. The 'g7 plus' brings together twenty fragile states and the group's action has had tangible and positive results in the relationships with development partners and in the functioning of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. The mutual advantages of its functioning have been recognised by the parties, including by the development partners.
Our democracy has been strengthened, election after election, with high turnout figures. That happened again this year, with presidential and parliamentary elections. The Democracy Index from The Economist1 considers Timor-Leste the most democratic country in Southeast Asia. This independent assessment strengthens our conviction that the sacrifices and the efforts made by our people have been worth it. It was the restoration of independence, in 2002, that brought to Timor-Leste the Rule of Law and the respect for Human Rights for the first time in centuries of history! This humanist heritage is precious to us.
The Global Agenda; Multilateralism
Excellencies, distinguished delegates.
If for no other reason, our national experience taught us to value multilateralism as a privileged instrument to respond to challenges within the international system. But there are other reasons. One of those reasons is the Global Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The Agenda embodies the potential of multilateralism to improve the planet and the well-being of the people. Benefiting from the global experience of the Millennium Development Goals process - with the introduction of the appropriate corrections - the success of the new Agenda can in fact and for the first time in the history of the world, eradicate extreme poverty and create a new paradigm of equal development opportunities within the international system. The success of the Agenda will benefit many millions of people whom poverty deprives of Basic Human rights. Only dialogue, negotiation, multilateral cooperation and democratic respect can meet the ambitious goals we established until 2030.
International society faces other unprecedented challenges, which also require multilateral cooperation and global responses:
The Paris Agreement
We believe that climate change will have growing impact on the development conditions of human societies and on the future of the planet. The impact on food security, among others, is at the core of our concerns and has been the target of several government measures, including
1 The Democracy Index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit and published last January takes into consideration social and political circumstances, namely the electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, political participation, political culture and functioning of the institutions..

6
within the scope of multilateral cooperation in the CPLP, the Community of PortugueseLanguage Countries, which we recently had the honour to preside.
I want to tell you, unambiguously, that the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which my country already ratified, is an inalienable responsibility of all states, big and small, to protect the planet from risks, where possible, and coordinate responses to vulnerabilities, where necessary.
Terrorism and other transnational crimes
Timor-Leste gives top priority to international cooperation in the fight against transnational criminality at all levels. We, the international community, have the inalienable duty to work to realize the civilization values enshrined in the Charter and the conventions of the United Nations. Experiencing these values requires the strengthening of cooperation against international criminality, namely in the suppression and elimination of human trafficking and sexual exploitation of adults and children and in the fight against international financial criminality, terrorism and other crimes. My country attaches great importance to international cooperation to fight against extremism, radicalism, terrorism, and piracy.
Multilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorism and transnational criminality, without exception, must be strengthened without hesitation and similarly without compromising the respect for human rights and other applicable international law. To compromise the values of our civilization in this fight would be, in itself, a victory for terrorism and criminality. TimorLeste participates in important multilateral processes for regional and international stability and security. We will continue to expand and deepen our participation in those processes.
Women and Citizenship
The state of Timor-Leste, with the support of the civil society and the development partners, has been implementing initiatives to promote the participation and the contribution of women in the process of social and economic development, including legal provisions against discrimination. There are many Timorese women in positions of high responsibility within the government, the Justice system, and other public or civil society institutions. One third of the members of the Timor-Leste National Parliament are women. Nevertheless, the protection of women against exploitation and the advancement of their role in society still require the development of policies that promote equality. Timor-Leste believes that, at the United Nations level, specific and decisive actions in favour of equality continue to be necessary - because women are often still the primary target of social discrimination and criminal exploitation.
Negotiation and nuclear non-proliferation

7
At this time, the world is facing two large threats to international peace: the hotbeds of war in the Middle East and the nuclearisation and escalation of tensions in the Korean Peninsula. My country calls on all parties involved, in both regions, to show utmost restraint, as to avoid measures and initiatives that would aggravate the situation. Timor-Leste calls on all parties to fully respect international conventions and the applicable resolutions of the Security Council. I specifically call for dialogue and negotiation to help dissipate tensions and promote the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Korean Peninsula.
I welcome the International Atomic Energy Agency's recent findings about the absence of signs of non-compliance with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Pian of Action signed by the Permanent Five Plus One2 and Iran. This negotiation and the compliance with this plan demonstrate the importance of dialogue for stability and the de-escalation of tensions.
Timor-Leste is in favour of non-proliferation and of negotiated nuclear disarmament. I call on the signatory countries of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to continue their joint efforts towards disarmament and non-proliferation, in preparation for the review of the treaty scheduled for 2020, to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.
Migrations and illegal immigrants
Our times bear witness to migratory movements of enormous size. Millions upon millions of people seek protection or basic economic means of survival, as a result of regional development asymmetries that are often shocking. My country welcomes the prospect of an intergovernmental conference on migration to be held next year, and considers it urgent to improve the coordination of the international community and the quality of the reception of these massive floods of migrants and refugees. It is also necessary to tackle the root of the problem, increasing development opportunities in depressed regions and reducing the motivation for migration flows.
Incomplete decolonisation
The UN was created in 1945, with the admission of 51 countries. Today, we are 193 member states. It is inspiring to reflect on the reasons for this exponential increase - the result of the greatest victory in the history of international society to date: the establishment of the principle and effective exercise of the right of all peoples to self-determination.
That victory of the peoples - the decolonisation - is also a victory of the United Nations. Nevertheless, the exercise of the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination continues to be postponed. The Sahrawi are peacefully waiting for the parties to comply with the relevant UN resolutions.
2 The Joint Comprehensive Action Plan Joint Comprehensive Action Plan) was negotiated and signed by the five permanent members of the Security Council plus the European Union and Iran (often referred to as the 1""5+1 andh'an).

They have been waiting for 26 years.
Dialogue and good neighbourliness
I call for dialogue between the Kingdom of Morocco and the legitimate representatives of the Sahrawi people and call on the United Nations to seek an urgent solution to hold a referendum on the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.
I also call for the lifting of the embargo against the Republic of Cuba, an anachronistic situation that is massively rejected by the international community.
I am very pleased to inform this General Assembly that Timor-Leste and Australia have made significant progress - decisive, even - in the talks about the demarcation of our shared maritime border.
INSERIR PARAGRAFO.
I am pleased about the establishment of dialogue between the Republic of the Philippines and the People's Republic of China on matters regarding the South China Sea, and also about the signs of progress arising from the ASEAN ministers meeting on the development of a Code of Conduct for the settlement of disputes in that area.
Timor-Leste supports the decision made by the ASEAN ministers, highlighting the need for measures to strengthen mutual trust between the states in the region and the exercise of the utmost restraint to avoid escalation and find peaceful solutions for current disputes, within the constraints of international law - including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea.
I also wish to convey, on this occasion, to the people and to the President of the Philippines, the solidarity of the people and of the state of Timor-Leste with the firm response of the Philippine government to the attempts to destabilise the country by international extremist groups.
Timor-Leste: the next few years
Earlier I told you about the fruits we reaped from the Restoration of Independence of TimorLeste 15 years ago. However, I am aware, as well as our people, of the great challenges to be overcome over the next few years. Despite the remarkable progress made with regard to some social and human indicators, the truth is that we must do better to achieve the goals set for 2030. Timor-Leste's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals is a structuring element of our inclusive, sustainable and productive vision for the Timorese economy over the next 10 years. I spoke to you about our vibrant democracy and our State apparatus: but we are quite aware of the need to qualify even more people - more well-prepared -to ensure better services. We need improved public services to achieve the Global Agenda goals. The Timorese State and public opinion are aware of this need. We are also aware of the need to improve the

9
mechanisms for transparency and accountability so as to eradicate waste, poor management practices and corruption.
These are our current goals. I am certain that we will achieve them. The Timorese citizens have also shown great commitment to these goals.
Achieving them will be our new battle, but this time a battle in times of peace.
I conclude by acknowledging the support of our development partners and the international community as a whole. We could not have come so far if it had not been for these partnerships. And today the support of our partners is equally precious for us to speed up our efforts to diversify the economy, develop our national productive sector and substantially improve the quality of our public services, as well as to improve our people's social and economic indicators and deliver higher levels of welfare over the next fifteen years.
From our side, we see development as a product of stability and confidence of the social and economic stakeholders. This holds true not only at national level but also internationally. TimorLeste will continue to closely cooperate at all levels towards regional and international security and stability. The support of the international community is highly valued by our people.
Thank you all."
Tonga,"Mr. President
I congratulate you on the assumption of your presidency of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly and I assure you that the Tonga delegation will fully support your able leadership in revitalizing and enhancing the crucial role of this august Organization.
[ express gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, a distinguished son of the Pacific Islands Region, with progressing the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda and successfully convening the inaugural Ocean Conference this year.
I also commend His Excellency Mr. Ant6nio Guterres the United Nations Secretary-General, for the sterling stewardship since the beginning of his first year at the helm. The Tonga delegation will fully support your important reform work.
We send our message of solidarity and sympathy to the people of Mexico, their families and friends affected by the devastating earthquake and; to the millions of people in the Caribbean and all those affected in recent weeks by the utter ravages of successive hurricanes.
Mr. President,
My delegation and I welcome your timely and relevant theme: ""Focusing on people: sn-iving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet."" It essentially emphasizes the peaceful wellbeing of all people and the conseyation and sustainable use of our globa! resources for present and fmH-e generations. Implementation is therefore crucial through sincere partnerships to collectively achieve the targets, goals and objectives stipulated under international law and internationally agreed outcomes.
In contributing towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the international agreed blueprint for the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS), the SAMOA Pathway, Tonga has established a National MonitorilN Mechanism. In this regard, we wish to acknowledge the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

The United Nations Development Assi stance Framework (UNDAF) 2013-2017 will conclude at the end of this year. Subsequently, the 5-year programme cycle entitled United Nations Pacific Strategy (UNPS) 2018-2022 for 14 Pacific Island Countries, which was signed in August 2017 at the UNDP Pacific Office, will commence.
The close partnership between the Government of Tonga and the United Nations System to effectively implemem the integrated Tonga Strategic Development Framework and the Agenda 2030 is reinforced through the coordination of UNPS 2018-2022 by the United Nations Joint Presence Office Delivering as One, which is led by the UNDP in Tonga. It is strategically positioned to provide technical advice to the Government, NGOs, Civil Society, and the Private Sector.
We also note the new senior management appointments by the UN Secretary-General. We welcome the appointment of the first woman from Tonga and the Pacific Islands Region to shepherd the important advocacy and facilitation work in the years ahead of the Office for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. We fully support the goal of gender parity, including at all levels in the United Nations Organization.
Mr. President,
The 2017 High Level Political Forum (HLPF) enabled the review of 7 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular: Goal.'; 3, on Good health and well-being; 5, on Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; and 14, on the Ocean and its resources. We commend the President of the Economic and Social Council for his initiative to devote adequate time to underscore and examine the complex sustainability challenges facing SIDS, as a Special Case, and thereby enhance efforts to implement the commitments called for in the SAMOA Pathway. The High Level Political Forum remains aaa important means for the follow-up, monitoring, and accountability of commitments to SIDS, which are essentially linked to the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
2

Mr. President,
We fully support Fiji's Presidency of the 23d Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change this year, to strongly address the adverse impacts of Climate Change and urgent need for innovation in Adaptation for SIDS.
We note the role of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asia Development Bank in availing disaster finance and respective financial tools to all SIDS.
While acknowledNng their work on expanding the definition of 'fi'agility', we urge further refinement of operational financing decisions to include the &ivers of vulnerability experienced in the Pacific Islands region, particularly natural disasters and adverse economic
shocks.
We reiterate our call for the appointment of a Special Representative on Climate and Security to ensure that the UN System has the appropriate tools to respond effectively and efficiently to Climate Change as an existential threat and a mounting security challenge for SIDS and the entire international community.
Mr. President,
Enhanced accessibility to modem and clean sustainable energy services, energ2 efficiency, and the use of economically viable and environmentally sound technolog3r and research, play a critical role in our sustainable development. Mitigation efforts are also essential to overcome the challenges of excess dependence on imported fossil fuels.
To further strengthen international and regional cooperation, the Pacific Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (PCREEE) was established in Tonga in April of this year. The Centre provides valuable support to Pacific Island countries and tenitoies towards progressing their respective priorities and commitments for achieving sustainable energy and contributing to SDGs 7, 9 and 13. It is a partnership between the Pacific Community, the Government of Austria, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and SIDS-DOCK, amongst others.

The General Assembly acknowledged the PCREEE upon adoption of the biennial resolution entitled: 'Cooperation between the United Nations atTd the Pacific Ls'larMs Forum' in July this year.
Mr, President,
However, we have, and continue to, experience the negative impacts of ocean degradation to our livelihoods and culture due to the anthropogenic activities and inter-related devastating effects of climate change. We already actively contribute to the implementation of SDG 14 and look forward to a strong collaboration with all interested parties. We hosted this year an international whaling meeting. The farsighted 1978 Royal Decree by His Majesty the Late King Tupou IV already banned whaling in Tongan waters. This farsighted decree was issued four years before the international ban on whale hunting came into effect.
This was re-affirmed during the April 2017 International Conference on Whales in a Changing Ocean we were honored to host.
We may be a Small Island State but all SIDS are large Ocean States.
To us and our people, successful implementation of Sustainable Development Goal t4 is critical for the pathway towards sustainable development and its inter-connection with achieving other goals such as those related to food security, water and sanitation, health, economic growth, and sustainable production and consumption. Strong political will for a whole-of-government approach, towards mainstreaming ocean-related actions from international, regional, and national development plans and strategies, will ensure the inclusive participation and efforts of all stakeholders including local communities and the private sector.
Tonga joined the international community in endorsing the ""(;'all Jbr Action"" outcome document of the Ocean Conference in June that contains almost 1400 voluntary commitments by stakeholders including 8 from Tonga.

It is a basis for the development of a blue economy or a Blue Charter as proposed by the Commonwealth Secretariat. There is urgency to develop practical guidelines and toolkits to assist States in delivering on all targets under Goal 14 in an integrated manner.
Mr. President,
We acknowledge the completion of the work of the preparatory committee on the development of a legally binding instrument under the UNCLOS for the conservation and sustainable use of the biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Tonga maintains its support for the early commencement of an intergovemmental conference to initiate negotiations on a substantive text.
We embrace the ongoing work of the International Seabed Authority in its administration and management of resources in the 'Area' in accordance with the Commor Heritage of Makittd'. Tonga congratulates the Secretary-General of the Authority in his first year in office, as he works with member states to develop the important exploitation regulations which must strike the appropriate balance between the conservation of the natural environment in which mineral resources exist, and its sustainable use. Consultations must be transparent and inclusive to ensure this balance is achieved. Tonga continues its engagement as a member state of the Authority and is seeldng re-election to the Council at the 24t Session of the Authority in 2018. A Tongan national with other members of the Legal and Technical Commission, provide expert views to facilitate the work of the Commission in developing the important financial mechanism to ensure fair and equitable distribution of returns from seabed mining.
Mr. President,
Tonga reiterates the call made under the SAMOA Pathway for genuine and durable partnerships to ensure no one is left belfind. A very credible partnership mechanism between the 12 Pacific SIDS and Italy, Austria, Luxembourg, and Spain is exemplified through the Joint Committee. It has been ably co-chaired by Italy and the Chair of the Pacific SIDS throughout each year since 2006. Tonga has thus benefitted through projects related to renewable energy, water, capacity-strenhening of young Government officials and more recently, marine protected areas.

We welcome the establishment of the India-United Nations Development Fund through the kIN Office for South-South Cooperation, which launched a project implemented by the UNDP for the establishment of early warning systems in Tonga and other Pacific Island Countries. The system relies on the timely provision of disaster risk information, guidance on how to act upon warnings, and ensuring a constant state of preparedness.

Sustainable development is possible where there is peace and security and sustainable development is key to peace and security. Finally, we urge all Leaders to focus and reflect on how best their power and legitimacy will benefit their own people and the entire world.

We appeal for a speedy resolution to the currant tensions in the Korean Peninsula that is affecting Globa! Peace and Security.

I congratulate the UN Secretary-General for the recent establishment of the High Level Advisory Board on Mediation to advise him on specific initiatives and related efforts around the world.

Mr. President,

May the Almighty God guide and bless you and a!! the member-states of the United Nations and their respective Governments and people.

Thank you."
Trinidad_and_Tobago,"Mr. President
Secretary General
Excellencies
Ladies and gentlemen
Each year, as a community of nations, we gather together to reaffirm the possibilities and potential that come from our resolve, that finding solutions to the many challenges facing our planet can best be achieved through our collective action, shared dialogue, and striving for peace and a decent life for all peoples.
On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, 1 am honoured and delighted to address this Assembly today. 1 extend heartfelt congratulations to you on your election as President of the 12^^ Session. We are confident that you will discharge your mandate with efficiency and impartiality for the benefit of all nations, and you have the support of our delegation
Further, I seize this opportunity to convey thanks and best wishes to His Excellency Peter Thompson, former President of the General Assembly, for his hard work, commitment and leadership during the Seventy-first session.
Once again, 1 extend congratulations to H.E. Antonio Guterres on his assumption to the position of Secretary General. We wish to encourage and commend his direction and guidance in steering us
forward.
Mr. President
From shifting weather patterns, to global warming, to sea level rise, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. In our region, we have witnessed the catastrophic effects of hurricanes Irma, Jose and Maria, which have undoubtedly changed forever lives in several of our Caribbean countries, leaving some islands almost uninhabitable and resulting in many untimely deaths. The recent earthquake in Mexico ought to be counted within the realm of the recent global disasters.
Trinidad and Tobago, which is in the southernmost part of Caribbean, was spared from the ravages of these hurricanes. It is with empathy that I extend, on behalf of the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago, heartfelt condolences to our Caribbean family. We are forever mindful that, given our spirit of resilience, we will rebuild that which was lost. Trinidad and Tobago stands in solidarity and shall continue to assist with the relief efforts. However, rebuilding will require resources, as well as the cooperation and collaboration of the international community, because we simply cannot do it alone.
The Government of Trinidad and Tobago, joins with other CARICOM Governments, in expressing our gratitude for the tremendous generosity and support provided in the face of the region's most urgent need. Our thanks and appreciation also goes out to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), the region's first responder. However, CDEMA will need additional resources and funding to enable the organization to do even more to facilitate its immediate responses to natural disaster.

Mr. President
In the face of the recent natural catastrophes, how can one deny the scientific findings that climate change is real, that it is here, and it is upon us? The events of the last months in the Caribbean once more remind us all that small island developing states remain at the forefront of the impact of climate change. We cannot, by any means, continue vidth the same approach as nature's fuiy
holds no prejudice.
Yet, in light of their categorisation as High Income Countries, on the outdated formulae ofGDP per capita, Caribbean countries, in their time of need, will not qualify for aid and development
assistance.
Mr. President
I join my Caribbean colleagues in calling for a multidimensional approach, that takes into consideration real national needs and priorities, and takes into account these extraordinary circumstances, to provide access to development assistance, aid and debt relief, as the Caribbean region embarks on the arduous task of recovery, rehabilitation and
reconstruction together.
In order to achieve human and global sustainable development, we must treat with unmitigated climate change and global temperature rise as a priority issue. Trinidad and Tobago is doing its part and remains committed to achieving the overarching objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the ParisAgreement. Through our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC], Trinidad and Tobago has indicated its intention to reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions in its public transportation sector by 30
percent by 31"" December 2030 compared to 2013 levels.
Mr. President
Trinidad and Tobago has therefore framed its national development plan for the period 2016 to 2030, titled ""Vision 2030"" with its thematic focus ""Many hearts. Many Voices, One Vision"" in keeping with Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. In this context, we have mapped our national development goals in accordance with global priorities and the SDGs. Trinidad and Tobago and the United Nations have signed the Multi-Country Strategic Development Framework (MSDF) in April
2017. We acknowledge and thank the UNDP for their assistance with these activities.
We are also pleased that the recently completed Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) has initiated a recalibration of the United Nations Development System [UNDS). This would better support developing countries, including SIDS, in the implementation of the programmes of action, including the SAMOA Pathway and the 2030 Agenda. In alignment with the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review and the Secretary-General's reform proposals, Trinidad andTobago remains committed to ensuring that the United Nations Development System adopts a more flexible and tailored approach to sustainable development assistance to assist countries in implementing
the SDGs in a focused, coordinated, coherent, and cost-effective manner.
Mr. President
Oceans cover three quarters of the earth's surface and contain over 95 percent of the earth's water. It is therefore indisputable that promoting the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources is of critical importance to sustainable development and the survival of all
mankind.

Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the progress achieved at the recently concluded Oceans Conference in June 2017 and the adoption of the historic Call for Action as well as commitments and actions to be taken by Member States to safeguard the health of the ocean through the implementation of SGD
14.
As a small island developing state (SIDS), Trinidad and Tobago is highly vulnerable to the unprecedented rate of loss of marine biodiversity and the impacts of unsustainable practices on the marine environment Consequently, we welcome the adoption of the Recommendations of the Preparatory Committee established pursuant to resolution 69/292 on the development of a legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Notably, this agreement will seek to address existing regulatory and legal gaps and ensure that the resources of our oceans are properly conserved and managed for the benefit of present and future generations
After two years of the Preparatory Committee and about ten years of negotiations, we believe the time is long overdue for us to translate words into action. Trinidad and Tobago therefore looks forward to the convening of an intergovernmental conference in 2018 to consider the recommendations of the Preparatory Committee on the elements and to elaborate the text of an international legally binding instrument under the Convention.
Mr. President
The Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago protects the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all citizens and residents without discrimination based on race, origin, colour, religion or sex. Our Government accords high priority to achieving gender equality, the empowerment and advancement of women which are pivotal to the achievement of the SDGs. In the words of UN Secretary General, ""Women's rights are human rights"". One cannot overstate the importance of protecting the rights of women and ensuring their full participation on an equal basis with men.
In placing women at the forefront of our development, it should be noted that a Trinidad and Tobago national is one of two women who sit on the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), which comprise 20 members. With regard to the advancement of girls, the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago recently passed the Miscellaneous Provisions (Marriage) Bill. This Bill provides for outlawing child marriage in Trinidad and Tobago by raising the legal age of marriage to 18 years.
Mr. President
We are currently witnessing unprecedented levels of displacement in the world. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR); approximately 65.5 million people have been forced to leave their homes. This amounts to nearly 22.5 million refugees.
Further, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago considers it important to develop ways to effectively manage migration and to take the necessary steps to enable the process of mainstreaming migration into development planning. We have therefore sought to make necessary policy changes, as well as participate in projects and training in order to develop the necessary tools to mainstream migration into development planning.
Mr. President
Trinidad and Tobago was among the 122 States which voted in favour of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons which was adopted on 7 July 2017. This Treaty is particularly

significant as it is the first multilateral legally binding instrument for nuclear disarmament to have been negotiated in 20 years. We look forward to the convening of the high-level conference on nuclear disarmament by 2018.
As a small island developing state, Trinidad andTobago actively participated in the negotiations to prohibit nuclear weapons, acutely aware of the destructive force of these weapons of mass destruction to, interalia, human life, the environment, food security, infrastructure and economic
growth.
In view of the continued prevalence and negative effects of illegal small arms and light
weapons,including the issue of curbing such weapons and its ammunition, Trinidad and Tobago has undertaken leading roles in a number of United Nations initiatives such as theArms
Trade Treaty.
The proliferation of small arms and light weapons has contributed significantly to violence and instability in our region. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) remains a key priority for Trinidad and Tobago as it seeks to regulate the illegal transfer of small arms and light weapons and
ammunition.
Mr. President
1 wish to reiterate to this august body, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago's unequivocal commitment and unceasing call for an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. We remain optimistic that there will be a diplomatic solution to finding an end to this longstanding issue and that in good faith the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba, which significantly challenges its achievement of sustainable development, will be
lifted soon.
We remain fully committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and in particular, to the principles of the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and non interference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and navigation. To this end, Trinidad and Tobago consistently supports sub-regional, regional and international efforts to promote constructive dialogue to bring about the cessation, sooner rather than later, of the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba.
Mr. President
Adherence to the rule of law is important to the achievement of SDG Goal 16, which seeks to
""promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for
air as it is one of the pillars for promoting sustainable development.
Trinidad andTobago as a democratic society adheres to the rule of law, the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and as such, we uphold the importance of the ICC to promoting the rule of law, encouraging respect for human rights and achieving sustainable peace and development, in accordance with international law and the principles of the Charter of the UN.
As a country which has been credited as one of the forefathers of the ICC through the pioneering work of the late Arthur NRRobinson, former Prime Minister and President ofTrinidad and Tobago, we remain resolute in our commitment to support the mandate of the ICC and its primary objective
to help put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, as well as to prevent such heinous crimes.

Mr. President
In conclusion, Trinidad and Tobago is particularly pleased with your decision in this 72^^ session to focus on ""people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet"" We believe that these concerns and issues are timely and necessary, especially as we are faced with increasing humanitarian challenges, threats to international peace and security, as well as the environment. In harmony with the global vision for multilateralism, we are committed to working together collectively to find enduring and sustainable solutions to global disparities, poverty, rising inequality, protracted conflicts and other challengesfacingthe world today.
We must all do our part in this noble endeavor for the good ofhumanity!
Thank you.
End"
Turkey,"Honorable Mr. President, Honorable Secretary General, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Esteemed Delegates,
I greet you with respect on behalf of myself and my country. I would like to thank Mr. PETER THOMSON for his successful work over the past year as the President of the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly.
I congratulate Mr. MiROSLAV LAJ(AK, who has taken over the Presidency of the General Assembly.
I hope that this year's Session of the General Assembly convening with the theme of
""FOCUSING ON PEOPLE: STRIVING FOR PEACE AND A DECENT LIFE FOR ALL ON A
SUSTAINABLE PLANET"" will bring goodness to all of the world's peoples.
Honorable Mr. President, Esteemed Delegates,
Unfortunately, global peace and stability have regressed further since our meeting in this hall last year.
We continue to see the ugly face of terror and war in different corners of the world. Terrorists, fed by the environment of conflict, continue their acts, spreading them across different regions.
We are anxiously observing the violent actions of radical currents converging on xenophobia, cultural racism and animosity against Islam.
The most effective way of reversing this negative outlook would be to engage in sincere cooperation here under this roof.
We need to develop a new perspective to promote world peace.
No crisis and no threat can be resolved by leaving it to play out on its own.
We all have to shoulder responsibility for a safer and more prosperous world.
It is with this understanding that Turkey is pursuing an enterprising and humanitarian foreign policy.

Honorable Mr. President, Esteemed Delegates,
The Syrian conflict, entering its seventh year, has created deep wounds in the country, the region and the whole world.
In Syria, a civilization is being annihilated together with civilians and innocent children.
Destroying this country and being fed by instability and oppression, terrorism spreads like a
cancer across borders.
The Syrian people who took action demanding democracy, freedom, justice and a bright future were unfortunately left alone by the international community.
Turkey could not remain indifferent to the tragedy of these people whom we see as our brothers and sisters regardless of their origin or creed and to whom we are connected with deep historical ties.
Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria in the Spring of 2011, we have exerted every kind of humanitarian and political effort to solve the problem and we will continue to do so.
We are now hosting more than 3 million Syrians and over 200,000 Iraqis in our country.
We have launched together with Russia and Iran the Astana meetings with the participation of al! conflicting parties in order to establish a permanent ceasefire and peace in the country.
Following our initiatives, the Geneva Process, which was blocked for a long time, has been revived.
We are putting into practice a new plan to ensure the security of the Idlib region within the framework of the agreement reached in Astana.
Turkey would be supportive of every step towards the construction of a stable and prosperous Syria, based on the territorial integrity of the country and respect for the democratic demands of its people.
Dear Friends,
We have taken and will continue to take all kinds of measures for those who came to our country with the outbreak of the Syrian crisis and to stem the influx of refugees into Europe.
We meet all the needs of these people from shelter to food and clothing, from health care to education at standards that are appreciated by everyone visiting our country.
However, I would like to underscore that we have not received sufficient support from the international community, especially the European Union, for the efforts we have been carrying
out.

The expenditures of our public institutions, civil society organizations and our people in order to meet the needs of those living in the camps and cities in Turkey have exceeded 30 billion US Dollars.
In turn, the European Union has sent only 820 million Euros out of the 3 billion Euros + 3 billion Euros that it promised.
Total assistance from the international community through the United Nations remains around 520 million Dollars.
I should point out that no share of the assistance intended for the Syrians goes into our own budget; they are all delivered to those in need by the relief agencies through the relevant institutions of the United Nations.
Before the whole world, I hereby call on the countries and the international organizations, which have put all the burden of the 3.2 million people on Turkey's shoulders, to fulfill the promises they have made.
In fact, Turkey is a country that carries out humanitarian aid and development assistance activities around the world.
Not only do we welcome those who come to our country...
Through Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA), the Disaster and Management Authority and the Turkish Red Crescent and various civil society organizations we rush to the help of all those who are suffering and under oppression, regardless of which part of the world they may be.
For example, through its official institutions and civil society organizations, Turkey has spent 1 billion US Dollars for the reconstruction of Somalia.
The work we carry out and the results we have achieved in Somalia would indeed set an example for similar efforts.
According to confirmed OECD statistics, with 6 billion Dollars of humanitarian and development aid in 2016, Turkey ranked as the world's second largest donor and top contributor in terms of GNP.
That said, Turkey is the 17th largest economy of the world.
Having spent 0.8% of its national income to humanitarian assistance, Turkey is one of the six countries that could meet the UN target.
As it can be seen, Turkey is working hard towards ""A SUSTAINABLE WORLD"" which constitutes the main message of our General Assembly.
We will continue in the time ahead with the same considerations in mind.

Honorable Mr. President, Esteemed Delegates,
Turkey is engaged in an intensive fight against the bloody terrorist organizations of the region such as DAESH and PKK nourished by the instability in Syria and Iraq.
In addition, our fight against the FETO terrorist organization, which attempted to change the legitimate and democratic regime of Turkey by a bloody coup, is also ongoing.
We have recovered 243 residential areas and a land larger than 2 thousand square kilometers thanks to the Operation Euphrates Shield initiated in Syria following the attacks of DAESH on our borders.
We have neutralized almost 3 thousand DAESH militants during that operation.
Around 100 thousand Syrians returned to and resettled in the region that we cleaned up from the terrorists.
The Operation Euphrates Shield is the single greatest accomplishment against DAESH since its occupation of the region.
I must highlight the following fact in your presence:
Most of the groups and forces claiming to fight against DAESH in the region in fact have no such purpose.
These groups and forces use DAESH as pretext to realize their own agendas.
The efforts by PYD-YPG to change the demographic structure in regions it has captured, to seize the property of the people, to kill or exile the ones who stand against it form a crime against humanity.
If the fight against DAESH is not conducted on a legitimate basis, it would be unavoidable for the world to come under the threat of new DAESH like entities.
Similar approaches exist in Iraq, as well.
Iraq also needs the compromises to be reached on the basis of territorial integrity and the realization of the ideals to build a common future.
Steps such as demands for independence that can cause new crises and conflicts in the region must be avoided.
We hereby call on the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government to abort the initiative they have launched in that direction.

Ignoring the clear and determined stance of Turkey on this matter may lead to a process that shall deprive the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government even the opportunities they currently enjoy.
We all should work on building tranquility, peace, security and stability in the region instead of sparking new conflicts.
Esteemed Mr. President, Dear Delegates,
Besides Syria and Iraq, we are also closely following the regions such as Libya and Yemen where terrorist organizations are trying to establish influence.
International community's support to the legitimate government in Libya shall contribute significantly to the stability of the country.
It should be kept in mind that if the mistakes made in Syria and Iraq are repeated in Libya, that will expose the whole world, particularly Europe, to much greater threats.
Another issue that Turkey lays delicate emphasis on is the immediate resolution of the conflict which has erupted in the Gulf region.
Purpose, we believe that the sanctions negatively affecting the living conditions of the Qatari people should first of all be lifted.
We support the mediation efforts of H.H. the Amir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah for the resolution of the crisis.
Our hope is that these efforts would yield positive result.
We also hope that Saudi Arabia whom we see as the elder brother of the Gulf region would show sincere will for the resolution of the issue.
Another important problem is the issue of Palestine which we consider to be the gaping wound of the world and, by extension the preservation of the historical status of Jerusalem and AI Haram AI Sharif.
The crisis in AI Haram AI Sharif in July has demonstrated the sensitivity of the issue.
The continuation of the peace process can only be possible on the condition that Israel immediately stops illegal settlement activities and takes steps towards a two-state solution.
In this context, I call on the international community to support our Palestinian brothers and sisters in Eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in their struggle for an independent and geographically unified Palestinian State.

Despite the current absence of conflict, the Balkans is another potential crisis geography which still faces serious challenges.
For this reason, we attach great importance to the integration of the Balkan countries with the Euro-Atlantic institutions.
Turkey will continue to do its part for peace, stability and welfare to prevail in this exceptional region of the world.
The territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and Georgia is the key for regional stability in Southern
Caucasus.
Therefore, we need to work harder for the resolution of the conflicts of Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
We should never forget that each crisis we ignore today has the potential to spark a regional and even global crisis tomorrow.
In this framework, I would also like to underline that we are against all sorts of nuclear weapons which have come to increasingly occupy the world agenda in recent days.
It's obvious that we could not overcome such problems unless we completely cleanse the world from the scourge of nuclear weapons.
We are saddened by the fact that the comprehensive negotiation process started in 2008 has ended due to the incomprehensible stance of the Greek Cypriot.
We will do our best to ensure that the natural resources discovered in the Eastern Mediterranean in recent years will serve the peace, stability and welfare of the region.
We are ready to consider proposals for a solution that respect the rights of the Turkish Cypriots.
Esteemed Mr. President, Dear Delegates,
While struggling with all these global and regional problems, our world was shocked once again by the sad news that we received from Myanmar a few weeks ago.
The Muslim community in the Rakhine region of Myanmar is being subjected to almost an ethnic cleansing, with provocative terrorist acts used as a pretext.
The villages of the Rohingya Muslims, who have already been living in extreme poverty and misery and deprived of their citizenship rights are burned down as hundreds of thousands of people are forced to migrate from the region and the country.

The camps in Bangladesh, to which the people migrating from the region are diverted, are not in a position to fulfill even the minimum humanitarian needs.
As it is the case in Syria, the international community has not given a good account of itself regarding the humanitarian plight which Rohingya Muslims have been exposed to.
If this tragedy in Myanmar is not stopped, the history of humanity will face the embarrassment of another dark stain.
What is most important is to ensure that the Rohingya, people, who have taken refuge outside their country, especially in Bangladesh, maintain their lives in safety, peace and welfare on their own lands where they have lived for centuries.
Turkey is endeavoring for the solution of this crisis, as well.
Recently on the occasion of a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, we held a special session on that matter in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, with the participating
countries.
We will hold the meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation Contact Group on Rohingya at the premises of the United Nations this afternoon.
My wife, my son and our Ministers who visited the camps in Bangladesh on September 7th, immediately after the latest crisis, personally witnessed the humanitarian plight.
The Turkish International Cooperation and Coordination Agency, which is the Turkish institution for official development aid, is the only organization that can carry out assistance activities in Myanmar.
Furthermore, Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, the Red Crescent, TiJrkiye Diyanet Foundation and various civil society organizations continue their activities to deliver humanitarian aid to the Rakhine Muslims refugees suffering in Bangladesh and other countries.
If concerned countries provide the necessary means, we would like to continue our assistance activities in a more comprehensive way.
Esteemed Mr. President, Dear Delegates,
All these developments and the humanitarian tragedies confirm the relevance of our appeal for the restructuring of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, symbolized by our motto ""the world is bigger than 5"".
Gathered here under this roof as the representatives of the entire world, if we cannot display the will to prevent the murders by terrorist organizations and humanitarian crises and grieving, then everyone will search for ways to help themselves.

If this understanding prevails, our world will be dragged into a new storm of chaos and cruelty. If Western countries do not prevent tendencies such as xenophobia, racism and animosity against Islam...
If the countries in the crises-ridden regions do not demonstrate the decisive will to fight terrorist organizations and poverty...
If we do not cooperate with one another on all these fronts...
How can we reach our ideals of peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet?
We support the work conducted towards this end by the Honorable Secretary-General, with whom we cooperated closely during his tenure as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not to the benefit of anyone to insist on the continuation of this distorted system which no longer has the capacity to take concrete steps towards the good of humanity under its current
form.
We want the Security Council to have a democratic, transparent, fair and effective structure. We propose that the Security Council consist of 20 members with the same rights and competencies to serve for two years and half of which are replaced every year.
As such, all countries in the world will have a say in this important institution when it is their
turn.
It is imperative that we transform the United Nations into a body that is capable of taking swift action, as the embodiment of humanity's common conscience.
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to remind you that regardless of the color of our faces and eyes, our tears is the same.
I urge you take action immediately to stop the tears flowing in various parts of the world.
I hope that the work of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly will contribute to our efforts to that end.
With these thoughts, I salute with amity and respect all countries and peoples represented under this roof, at this joint parliament of humanity.
I wish you health and well-being..."
Tuvalu,"President of the General Assembly Excellencies Ladies and Gentlemen
1. Next week on the 1st of October, Tuvalu will mark its 39th Anniversary of Independence. It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the Government and people of Tuvalu, to thank the United Nations and all its Membership for granting Tuvalu the recognition of full sovereignty in October 1978.
2. Twenty-nine years after on the eve of the 21st Century, September 2000, Tuvalu was admitted as the 169th Member of the UN, with the rights of full participation as a Member of the UN Family. Our joining the UN is a journey of hope. Hope in the noble values of this great body, the UN, and trust in its ability to assure humanity, including small and vulnerable countries like mine, peace and security, and prosperity for our survival.
3. I record Tuvalu's sincere gratitude to the UN and its specialized agencies, development partners especially our traditional partners in the Pacific, regional bodies of the Pacific, friends in Asia, India, South Korea, Japan, in the Republic of China/Taiwan, in the EU and others for all your support to my island nation of Tuvalu. We welcome the friendship and partnership of UN members and other entities as we advance forward.
4. Mr President, we applaud the theme of the 72nd General Debate, ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet."" It captures the undeniable linkage between peace, security and sustainable development. It underscores that, without peace and security, our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will not deliver a fair globalization for all. In short, without sustainable development, there will be no peace and security.
5. Accordingly, I congratulate you, Mr President, on your appointment to the Presidency and for your vision on the 72nd Session. And I also congratulate the outgoing President of the General Assembly Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji for his efforts and outstanding leadership - sa vinaka vakalevu.
6. Mr President, as a small and vulnerable island nation, I want to express Tuvalu's deepest sympathy to the people in the USA and in the Caribbean islands who are being affected by the destruction of the recent hurricanes and tropical cyclones. These unfortunate events clearly show the magnitude and urgency of global work still required of the UN to better prepare, protect and save peoples and humanity from these calamities.
7. We also share the devastating grief of the people of Mexico including young school children following the earthquake this week, and other peoples suffered by disasters, and violence around the world. Our prayers that Almighty God gives comfort to the affected people and their loved ones, for speedy recovery.

8. Mr President, horrific acts of violence and terrorism continue to plague our world. Countless innocent lives are destroyed and lost. Violence in any form is a direct threat to peace and security, and seriously undermines our efforts to achieve sustainable development. We therefore condemn violence and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
9. We are particularly concerned with the threat to global peace and security posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We acknowledge the persistent efforts of the Security Council to de-escalate tensions. A renewed engagement with inclusive diplomatic dialogue is, in our view, the only option to solve the crisis on the Korean Peninsula. We believe that a military response will lead to unimaginable destruction and loss of lives. History has taught us the mistakes of the past that we must not repeat.
10. In this vein, Tuvalu maintains its commitments in support of all international legal instruments against violence and terrorism. It is critical that we support international law for the protection and promotion of human rights. We commend the establishment of the Office of Counter Terrorism to ensure the effective and balanced implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.
11. Just yesterday, with pride on behalf of Tuvalu, I signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as a further commitment to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, which was negotiated and drafted in the 1984 Pacific Island Leaders Forum held in Tuvalu. It is our fervent hope that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, including the trade of materials and development of technologies to produce such weapons, are totally banned and prohibited worldwide by the UN. Humanity must be advanced not on the principles of fear and deterrence, not on the adage of might is right, rather on moral justice for human equity, trust, respect, and the  enjoyment of basic human rights.
12. Mr President, the entry into force of the Paris Agreement last year raised our hopes that, recognizing the existential threat to us all, Member States would commit to the common cause of fighting climate change, adapting to its impacts, and strengthening the ability of developing States, especially the most vulnerable, to deal with those impacts. The Paris Agreement is our common hope of a decent life on a sustainable planet. For Tuvalu, it is our hope of security and survival.
13. That hope, however, dimmed with the announcement by the United States that it will abandon the Paris Agreement. That decision risks undermining our global efforts to save and protect the livelihoods of the people that are at risk from the impacts of climate change. These are the marginalized, the vulnerable, the poor, the women and children who suffer the most from climate change, and especially the people living on low-lying islands and coastal areas. These people count in the tens of millions and the number is increasing at an alarming rate.
14. Domestic economic and political interests, are often short term and benefitting only a few, should not be pursued at the expense of a decent life for us all, current and future
3

generations, on a sustainable planet. This is the spirit that underpins our 21st century development system. We therefore urge the United States to re-unite with us and to allow all of us, in particular the most vulnerable, the best possible chance to save ourselves, and the sustainable future of humanity. We are nevertheless encouraged by the strong leadership of the Canadian Prime Minister and French President on climate change.
15. We welcome the Secretary General's intention to convene a dedicated climate summit in 2019 to mobilise political support. It will be an important opportunity to review our progress and momentum, and most importantly, to enhance our commitments to take urgent and credible actions to reverse global warming.
16. We are also encouraged by the Secretary General's commitment to intensify highlevel political engagement to limit temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and in fact aiming at limiting the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We are likewise heartened by his dedication to rallying the UN systems to better support Member States by mobilizing resources and strengthening partnerships in their pursuance of climate actions.
17. Indeed, without enhanced commitment and genuine partnerships, the Paris Agreement will not save us - the most vulnerable. Climate change is a risk multiplier on all factors of development. Its challenges are complex and changing. It is for this reason that we reiterate our call for the appointment of a Special Representative on Climate Change and Security for enhanced international focus, coordination and commitment.
18. In the same vein, we cail for climate change and security to be a permanent item in the agenda of the Security Council, given its direct threat to global peace and security.
I9. For Tuvalu and many of the low-lying islands, our peace and security is not imperiled by traditional threats of conflicts, violence, drugs, weapons, famine, or diseases. Instead, as the Male' Declaration on the Human Dimension of Climate Change recognized in 2007, ""the impacts of climate change pose the most immediate, fundamental and far-reaching threat"" to individuals and communities in these most vulnerable States, and threaten a wide range of human rights, including ""the right to life, the right to take part in cultural life, the right to use and enjoy property, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to food, and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.""
20. Ten years ago, Mr President, we recognized that climate change was the single major threat to our peace, security, and ultimately our survival. It remains so today, and the situation grows more urgent every day. Under current warming trends, our islands may be submerged into the sea within the next 50 years. If and when this happens, we will be forced to abandon our islands, even though we are the least contributors to global warming and sea level rise. That forced relocation or displacement of our people is an injustice and an infringement on our fundamental and basic human rights.
4

21. It is for this very reason that we continue to call for enhanced global commitment and partnerships in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. We cannot give up on this campaign, for two very simple reasons. First, relocation and statelessness are unacceptable, as any of us here would agree. Second, we know as you do, that the membership of our global family of the United Nations has the tools and the resources to save Tuvalu and lowlying states from the impacts of climate change. It is only a question of whether we have the will and courage to help.
22. Mr President, we have come together to face grave risks before. Over the years, the international community, guided by the Charter of the United Nations, cooperated on many fronts to deal with threats Such as ebola and cholera, violence, natural disasters, and subsequently, the lives and rights of people displaced by such threats.
23. During those circumstances, the international response was immediate because human lives and human rights were at risk and needed protection. The response was also immediate because the threats were potential global threats to humanity. For others, however, their response was driven by political and economic interests. But most importantly, the threats were controlled and human lives and human rights were saved and protected.
24. Sadly however, displacement by impacts of climate change have not yet drawn the same international concern and response, despite the fact that it has the very real potential to become a serious threat to global peace, security and human rights.
25. Uncontrolled mass migration into Europe as a result of conflicts and natural disasters taught us a very important lesson - that we should have had in place effective international institutions and systems to control, manage and protect the rights of migrants. In exactly the same manner, we must now be formulating effective international systems to protect the human rights of people displaced by the impacts of climate change, and avoid further uncontrolled mass migration and mass violation of human rights.
26. That preparation must include developing the appropriate international legal tools to cope with the complex and multifaceted challenges posed by climate change, which cut across a number of different areas of international law. In particular, the current refugee regimes, which were developed to cope with the traditional threats, do not adequately protect people forced to leave their homes by the impacts of climate change. We therefore reiterate our proposal for a UN Resolution on the establishment of a legal process to protect the human rights and ultimately save the lives of people displaced by the impacts of climate change.
27. Mr President, as a least developed country and a SIDS, we need enhanced global support to overcome the structural challenges we face in implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. On our own part, Tuvalu has developed its national strategy for sustainable development, Te Kakeega III, premised on building resilience through good
5

governance, inclusive participation, and capacity measures of mitigation of NDCs with targets of 100% renewable energy by 2020, and coastal protection adaptation on all islands to protect and save Tuvalu.
28. We are grateful to the international community through the GCF, the GEF, and the UNDP as well as through bilateral sources for their generous support. While grateful for the goodwill, we have established the Tuvalu Climate Change and Disaster Survival Fund as a facility to help people respond quickly to impacts of tropical cyclones, hurricanes and wave
surges.
29. To enhance further adaptation work, access to appropriate infrastructures, maritime ports, airports, technology connectivity, health, quality education, and renewable energy are critical areas of particular priority. Tuvalu will welcome the development of genuine and durable partnerships as are aspired under the SAMOA Pathway.
30. In regards to the issue of LDC graduation, it is our view that a country must only graduate when it cart achieve sustainable development, not merely when it should be able to achieve sustainable development. Misguided graduation will only impose further constraints to our efforts to achieve sustainable development. Unique vulnerability of SIDS/LDCs like Tuvalu must be the central criteria of consideration for LDC graduation.
31. As small islands surrounded by vast oceans, we interact with the ocean every day of our lives. We are heavily dependent on the ocean as a source of food and for many of us, the ocean is central to our achievement of sustainable development. We firmly believe that once we have established our baselines under the UN Convention on the Law of the sea, these baselines as well as the maritime zones shall be remained forever. This is irrespective of sea level rise.
32. The ongoing discussions on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction (""BBNJ"") must ensure that small island developing states, with our particular vulnerabilities, are provided the necessary financial and technical support to guarantee our equal and fair participation in the management of BBNJ and the sharing of benefits from the BBNJ Instrument. We must agree at this Assembly to commence work on developing a legal binding agreement to give protection to biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction.
33. Our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is universal and holistic in that it applies to all countries and actors, and covers aU aspects of sustainable development. Critical to its success, the agenda is rooted in human rights and genuine partnerships.
34. But Mr President, the vibrant democracy of Taiwan who has long been an active and responsible development partner to many countries including Tuvalu, is being denied participation in the UN systems. It cannot be right, that the 22nd largest global economy with a notable capacity to contribute, could not effectively participate in our 2030 Agenda.

This is unfortunate when our 2030 Agenda needs genuine global partnerships to mobilise all available resources to be successful.
35. Under its principle of universality, the UN should allow the 23 million people of Taiwan their fundamental right to participate fully in the UN systems, and to benefit and contribute effectively to its programs.
36. In the same vein, the people of Cuba must be allowed to freely exercise their rights to determine their own political, economic and social systems. With their rights and trade restricted by the unilateral blockade by the US, the people of Cuba are denied effective participation in our UN SDGs programme.
37. Of similar concerns, the people of West Papua should be enabled to exercise their fundamental right, with the intervention of this responsible body, to allow them to determine their own development aspirations and future. The West Papuans are a distinct people with Pacific roots, with their own land, history and identity. The violation of human rights in West Papua is a constant matter of great concern to us. Tuvalu strongly believes the UN must engage in setting a clear pathway to addressing these issues and the issue of selfdetermination of the people.
38. We must embrace the genuine partnership of those who can contribute to the realization of a decent life in our marginalized communities. We cannot ignore and risk leaving behind those whose hope for a decent life, but are being constrained by violence, natural disasters, violation of human rights, atrocities, and impacts of climate change. We cannot leave anyone behind.
39. Finally Mr President, I want to lend Tuvalu's strong support for a Global Pact on the Environment. We need an internationally legally binding agreement that protects our rights to a safe and clean environment.
40. We are but on one canoe for humanity, no one country must jump ship! We either must paddle together to keep us afloat and safe. Or allow the canoe to sink, and we all drown. It is our hope, that with this Global Pact and the Paris Agreement, the canoe, we can save Tuvalu, and if we can save Tuvalu we can save the world.
41. God Bless the Family of the United Nations.

FOCUSING ON PEOPLE STRIVING FOR PEACE AND A DECENT LIFE FOR ALL, ON A SUSTAINABLE BASIS
I congratulate H.E. Mr Miroslav Lajk on his election as President of the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly and assure him of Uganda's support. We are confident that he will lead the Assembly effectively and successfully. I would also like to express our gratitude to H.E. Mr Peter Thomson, for his leadership of the 71st Session. I pay tribute to the SecretaryGeneral, H.E. Ant6nio Guterres, for his personal dedication and commitment to the work of the United Nations.
The theme for this Session, ""Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent life for all on a Sustainable Planet"" is very pertinent.
I am happy this topic is being discussed. I have always wondered why the elites in the different countries of the world do not see this. Who would lose if all the people on the globe led a decent life of:
(a) having 2,000-2,500 calories per day for an adult person;
(b) having immunization for all the immunizable diseases;

THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
(c) accessing education for literacy, numeracy and skills as a minimum;
(d) having a health unit within the radius of 5 kilometers from
where one lives; (e) having access to clean electricity, away from charcoal, fire-
wood and the dirty kerosene; .... {)- havingaccessto-a well paying job.
(g) having a decent 3 bedroom house for each family; (h) having access to clean water; (i) every person having not to worry about war, terrorism and
crime; (j) every producer of a service or a good that is needed for use
having the right of access to markets? (k) all countries had good transport and other elements of
infrastructure; and (1) all of us insisting on protecting our mother nature so that
it can also look after us?
To what extent would this effort at global affluence stimulate
business? How much cement, steel, copper, food, etc., would we need and how would all that impact business? Why do we have only bad businessmen who do not have efficient spectacles that can see these business opportunities in global
affluence?
As a milk and beef producer, only a few months ago, I was cautioning my fellow farmers against excessive greed as far as the price per litre of milk and per kg of beef were concerned. The more buyers we would have for our products, the more prosperous we would be. We would, therefore, be both good business persons and good Christians.

THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
Parasitism is the only obstacle to global affluence, prosperity
and peace.

On the dangerous situation on the Korean Peninsula, where very dangerous instruments of mass extermination are paraded around by the two contending sides, I have one question. Who
woutd lose if- North-Koreand S outh- Korea,hose kith-andkin_, .....................
were left alone to discuss their re-unification? The Korean nation came into existence ever since 1234AD.
They were temporarily divided towards the end of the 2nd World War. Why should this division be allowed to be permanent and a source of dangerous tensions? A unified Korea would be a
very strong nation. Why do some actors fear strong nations in
the world? Why should the Koreans themselves (North and South) allow external forces to continue to divide them? We always strive not to allow actors, foreign or local, to divide the African peoples, regardless of the complications involved. When you hear that Uganda accommodates many African
refugees, it is on account of a conscious ideological position -not to allow any actors to divide us. We only fight traitors.
Who has been hurt by a unified Vietnam since 1975 although the method of their unification was not the best one? Who has been hurt by the re-unification of Germany in 1990?
On the small issue of enforcing sanctions against North Korea, Uganda is in compliance. We do not have to trade with North Korea. We are, however, grateful that, in the past, the North Koreans helped us to build our tank forces.

I thank you."
Ukraine,"Statement by H.E. Mr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine,
during the General Debate of the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly
September 20, 2017
Distinguished Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, On behalf of Ukraine, I sincerely congratulate the honorable Mr. Miroslav Lajck on his election as President of the 72nd session of the General Assembly. Mr. President, Ukraine fully supports all six priorities defined by you for the upcoming session and is ready to assist you in your noble efforts. A lot must be done to translate our common vision of a peaceful, prosperous and equal world into reality. The spiral of violence continues to affect more and more countries and regions. Transnational terrorism, use of force in international relations, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, refugee crisis, poverty, human rights violations and environmental fragility are only some of the challenges we face. The scope of threats demands our joint resolute response. It is time to act and we have a very narrow window of opportunity to avoid sliding down into irreversible chaos.

The United Nations should be at the forefront of this process.
Ukraine has always advocated the need to reform the United Nations to meet the most urgent global challenges timely and adequately.
In this regard, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General, since the first day of his mandate, to develop and implement a robust, comprehensive UN reform agenda.
No less than we welcome and support the US initiative to promote an effective and meaningful reform of the United Nations.
A comprehensive reform of the Security Council is long overdue.
We hope that this session will herald a new momentum in the Intergovernmental Negotiations on a blueprint for Security Council reform.
Mr. President,
Let me take this chance to state clearly that we in Ukraine cannot agree more with the call for the sovereignty to be universally respected and guaranteed.
This very conclusion was timely and rightly raised yesterday from this podium.
When the UN was set up, it was designed to maintain peace and security in the world based on principles of respect for sovereignty and integrity of borders.
The founding nations, among those was Ukraine as well, aimed at securing the world where the sovereign right of free choice to be respected.
So was this principle to be guarded by P5 in the name of sustainable peace and security.
That was the principle that happened to be so blatantly violated against my own country by one of the P5.
This is the principle which is to be back on track upon whatever means and tools we have at hand.
And Ukraine is a right place to invest into this noble endeavor, in the name of sustainable peace and security.
That is what millions of Ukrainians have struggled for since the beginning of the Russian aggression in 2014 in Donbas and Crimea.

A three-year-long war with Russia has resulted in 10 thousand people killed, 7% of Ukrainian territory occupied, 20% of Ukrainian economy and industrial output is seized, destroyed or simply stolen.
However, the most horrific thing in this situation is that the Kremlin has consciously chosen the tactics of increasing human sufferings.
The occupied Crimean peninsula, according to the human rights activists, has turned into a territory of repressions.
Anyone disagreeing with Kremlin risk their freedom and even life.
Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars get arrested even for posts in social networks or, as it was in case of Crimean farmer Volodymyr Balukh in December 2016, for putting a Ukrainian national flag on a private residence.
Persecution of the leaders of the Mejlis  the representative organ of Crimean Tatars, whose activities were banned by the Russian occupiers continues.
Only a week ago, Ahtem Chiygoz, Deputy Head of the Mejlis, was sentenced to 8 years of prison for standing up against the Russian occupation.
Another Deputy Head of the Mejlis, Ilmi Umerov, with serious health problems, remains under house arrest, not even allowed to leave Crimea for medical treatment.
Russia blatantly violates the UN General Assembly Resolution 71/205 ""Situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol"".
It keeps ignoring all requests of the Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure proper and full access of the international human rights monitoring missions to Crimea.
The Kremlin pays no respect to the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice imposed on it.
The ICJ urged Russia to refrain from maintaining or imposing limitations on the ability of the Crimean Tatar community to conserve its representative institutions, including the Mejlis, and to ensure the right for Ukrainian citizens to study in Ukrainian language.
Such disregard of Russia's international obligations must receive proper response of the international community.

The international community has to keep a close eye on Crimea to prevent a new genocide inspired by modern proponents of Stalin's totalitarian ideology against the Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians.
I rely on support of your delegations for Ukraine's initiatives to ensure observance of human rights in the temporarily occupied Crimea, in particular a further respective UN GA resolution.
We need to strengthen the international regime of de-occupation of Crimea.
The fact that at the highest international level  UN General Assembly  Russia was recognized as an occupying power, proves that we are on the right track.
The time has come to establish an international group of friends of Ukrainian Crimea to coordinate our common steps.
We count on coordinated and targeted support of our international partners.
Militarization of Crimea is another security threat that affects the whole of Southern and Eastern Europe as well as North Africa and the Middle East.
Ukraine strongly condemns numerous military exercises conducted in the occupied Crimea as well as close the borders of Ukraine, in particular ""West-2017"".
Together with our neighbors and partners we urge Russia to ensure full compliance with its commitments under the OSCE Vienna Document and other international rules concerning military activities.
The security and human rights situation in Donbas remains no less dramatic than in Crimea.
This year Ukraine initiated three major ceasefire attempts - Easter, Harvest and Back-toSchool ceasefires. Yet again, Russian occupation troops and their proxies violated them almost immediately.
In breach of the Minsk agreements, Russia keeps its regular military and continues to supply heavy weapons and ammunition to the occupation troops in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
It flatly denies the establishment of the OSCE permanent control over Ukraine-Russia border.

The release of hostages within the Minsk process is completely deadlocked.
A list of Ukrainian hostages in Donbas grows constantly. People are captured deliberately. Their only fault is that they have a pro-Ukrainian position.
We remember the fate of 16-year-old Stepan Chubenko, who was killed with 5 shots in the head (!), after Russians saw him wearing a Ukrainian ribbon.
Another example. The 63-year-old Donetsk theologian Ihor Kozlovsky is in jail for over two years under false accusations and deprived of any communication with family and friends.
Russia still keeps at least 16 Ukrainian political prisoners on its territory.
Ukrainian film-director Oleh Sentsov and Ukrainian journalists Roman Suschenko are among the most prominent cases.
Just think about it.
Stealing other nations' land... kidnapping people... conducting a hidden war...downing a civilian aircraft... spreading lies globally  is this the kind of behavior we expect from a permanent Security Council member?
Russia is not a contributor to international security, but its biggest threat.
Today Russia is, perhaps, the only country in the world that has conflicts  hot, frozen or potential  with almost all its neighbors.
Mr. President,
The key problem in Donbas is that Ukraine and Russia strive for completely different things.
Ukraine wants peace and restoration of sovereignty over its territory.
Russia wants control over Ukraine and undermines every effort to restore our sovereign control within Ukraine's borders.
So, Russia tries to exchange peace in Ukraine for Ukraine's freedom.
Ukraine will never accept that kind of a deal, nor will the international community.

The latest hybrid ""peacekeeping proposals"" from Moscow are yet another example of Russia's real ambitions  to legalize its proxies and to freeze the conflict forever.
We would welcome any proposal that would bring peace to my country.
We remain convinced that a full-fledged UN peacekeeping operation is the only viable solution to de-escalate, to protect people of Ukraine and to get us closer to a political solution.
That is why the peacekeepers' mandate should cover the entire occupied area, including the Ukrainian-Russian state border.
This is the must.
As long as the border is used as the main supply route for manpower and weapons to Donbas, there will be no peace in my country.
This mission should respect basic UN peacekeeping principles and guidelines.
One of them is that UN peacekeepers should be impartial. There is no place for aggressor's personnel. They cannot be a part of it by definition.
Let me stress: any abuse of the UN peacekeeping toolbox to secure the gains of aggression is unacceptable.
If we have an opportunity to bring peace to the heart of Europe  we should get the conditions right.
A robust international presence can also help us cope with the increase of terrorist activities in the conflict-affected areas.
The terrorist component in Russia's hybrid war against Ukraine is clearly visible and became a reality of everyday life in Donbas.
Three years ago, the world was stunned when the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 carrying 298 people onboard was blown up in the skies over Donbas.
Ukraine is determined to do everything to bring to justice those responsible for this mass murder.
Two investigations  technical and criminal  have been carried out.

Both revealed the details.
Those who were behind this horrible crime came from Russia. The missile came from Russia.
The death of the MH17 victims is on Russia's conscience.
The five countries comprising the Joint Investigation Team have decided to prosecute those responsible for downing of MH17 within the Dutch judicial system.
This year, the International Court of Justice has started hearings in the case brought by Ukraine against Russia for violating the 1999 Financing of Terrorism Convention.
We hope that the decision of the United Nations' highest court will help bring the Russian Federation to justice for its numerous violations of international law and for financing crimes committed since 2014.
As the process begins, we count on support and facilitation of all UN Member States.
Mr. President,
For decades, Ukraine has served as a resolute contributor to global security.
In the name of peace and in exchange for security assurances, Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal  third largest in the world.
Twenty years after Ukraine was invaded by one of those who vowed to respect and (if necessary) to protect Ukraine's borders.
Yet, we remain resolute advocates of global non-proliferation and disarmament.
That's why we strongly condemn nuclear tests and multiple launches of ballistic missiles by the North Korea.
We are deeply concerned about the continuous diversion of the resources from critical human needs to feeding Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal, coupled with serious human rights abuses.
We resolutely stand for reinforced measures to stop Pyongyang's illegal activities and bring the North Korea in line with the international legal framework.

At the same time, let me reiterate Ukraine's call upon the UN Security Council to undertake in-depth investigation into the development of the North Korean nuclear and missile programmes, in order to expose any possible foreign assistance to Pyongyang in this area.
We also express our deepest concern with the current situation in Syria.
We believe that full implementation and adherence to the word and spirit of the 2012 Geneva communiqu and UNSC resolution 2254 are absolutely vital for the settlement of the conflict in that country.
What draws our special concern with regard to this bloody conflict is Russia's use of the occupied Crimea as a military outpost for projecting power in Syria.
As the war there rages on, huge numbers of Russian military assets are deployed to Syria by ships based in the Crimean harbors.
It is also deeply disturbing that the African continent continues to suffer from the numerous unresolved conflicts.
Being the UN Security Council non-permanent member, my country has spared no effort to support the African continent in safeguarding the main principles of the international order  sovereignty, non-interference in domestic affairs, the rule of law and peaceful settlement of disputes.
As Chair of the Committee established by the Council Resolution 2127, we have actively supported regional and international efforts to stabilize the situation in the Central African Republic.
As of January 2017, Ukraine assumed chairmanship of the 1591 Committee on Sudan, and we are determined to contribute to the international efforts to resolve the conflict in Darfur.
African countries can fully count on Ukraine as its reliable friend.
Mr. President,
My country is fully committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Despite heavy defense expenses more than 5% of its GDP, Ukraine keeps going through fundamental transformations  fighting corruption, promoting judicial reforms, implementing decentralization, improving business opportunities.
A year and a half ago the economic situation in Ukraine was so dire that we could only dream about macroeconomic stabilization.
Now we have all grounds to say that economic recovery is in place.
Such areas as ensuring sustainable energy supply, food security, promoting innovation development and sustainable infrastructure as well as promoting an effective public health system, affordable education and decent work are among priorities within the 2030 UN Development Agenda in Ukraine.
I am convinced that no country alone can achieve sustainable development without sustainable peace and security.
There is also no doubt that the mitigation of global warming remains one of the indispensable elements of sustainable development.
Ukraine is fully committed to our obligations under the Paris climate agreement.
Our intentions in this regard are very serious. Ukraine was the first European country, which deposited its instrument of ratification to the United Nations.
Mr. President,
The United Nations has always played a leading role in ensuring that the crimes of the past could never happen again.
The 72nd session of the General Assembly coincides with the 85th Anniversary of one of the deadliest crimes of the 20th century  the crime of Holodomor.
It was a man-made famine in Ukraine in 1932-1933 organized by the Stalin totalitarian regime that killed 7 to 10 million Ukrainians.
Dr. Raphael Lemkin, the author of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, described that destruction of the Ukrainian nation as ""the classic example of genocide"".
I appeal to all UN member states to make their own historic judgement and to make decision by recognizing Holodomor as an act of genocide.

Mr. President, This is a challenging time for all of us. Evermore people die in wars and natural disasters. Truth is blindsided by the post-truth. The world is divided again  between those who believe that freedom is indispensable and those who believe freedom is expendable. One group wants to reach a better future. The other one drags us into the past. It's time for those who believe in freedom to come together. It's time for freedom to be strong, convincing and convinced. Let's be that way! Thank you for your attention."
United_Arab_Emirates,"Mr. President,

Please Check Against Delivery

Let me begin by congratulating you on your presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your deep experience in international affairs will contribute to its success, and we stand ready to provide you with all the support and cooperation you need. I also wish to thank your predecessor, Mr. Peter Thompson, for his stewardship of the last session.

Let me also take this opportunityto express my country's appreciation for the efforts ofthe Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, to reform the United Nations' work in conflict prevention and the achievement of peace and security. We fully support his vision, which will require United Nations member states to cooperate more closely on both existing and emerging global challenges.
The foreign policy of the United Arab Emirates is guided by principles consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and international law: a spirit of partnership, support for the rule of law, good-neighborliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. These principles lead us to support a stronger role for the United Nations, and its reform, so that it can fulfil its mandate to maintain international peace and security and to bring about development and prosperity.



Mr. President,
The United Arab Emirates works hard and responsibly, both within its neighbourhood and beyond it, to promote the stability and development of Arab countries and tackle the destruction which our region's wars have left in their wake. We see security and stability as the key to the advancement of nations and peoples, a promising future for younger generations, and a decent life for all. Our collective priority must be to promote peace and stability.
Despite serious regional and international efforts, our region continues to suffer from crises. These have several causes: extremism and terrorism; continued interference by states in each other's internal affairs; aggressive and expansionist policies driven by hegemonic ambitions; and regimes which seek influence by providing support to extremist and terrorist groups to undermine legitimate governments and spread chaos and conflict throughout the region and the world. These crises have killed many, displaced millions and destroyed infrastructure. If this situation persists, it will only generate more violence, destruction and depletion of economic, cultural and human resources not only in our region, but throughout the world.
There is no doubt that we, as an international community, have made progress in confronting security and humanitarian threats. However, more can be done to restore stability in the Arab world. The UAE believes that the initial steps to restore stability in the region should be the following:
First: to protect the development progress that has been made, and prevent any party from obstructing or wrecking collective efforts at peacebuilding. Otherwise we will be reduced to managing these conflicts instead of being able to solve them. I refer in particular to Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia. In those countries comprehensive political solutions can be achieved. Stability can be restored. But this will only be possible if we put a stop to outside interference in Arab affairs, and prevent any form of support from being given to extremist and terrorist groups. In this regard, we support the efforts of the United Nations to bring warring parties to the negotiating table and achieve comprehensive political solutions for the crises in our region.
Second: to unite in a firm and sincere rejection of extremism and terrorism in all its manifestations. There is no other way to confront and eradicate this scourge. My country believes that the Riyadh Summit was historic by any standard. It attracted an
2

unprecedented breadth of attendance at the highest levels, including the important participation of the President of the United States. The outcomes of the Summit demonstrated that the Arab and Islamic world stands firmly against terrorism and its ideological roots.
We believe that the elimination of this threat from our Arab region is within our reach. The liberation of ancient Arab cities with a rich history, such as Mosul in Iraq and Mukalla in Yemen from the grip of terrorist organizations is proof of this. It shows what can be achieved when we work together to combat extremism and terrorism.
Third: To take collective action to identify countries that support and finance terrorism, and hold them accountable. This is why the UAE has taken measures in tandem with its close allies the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Arab Republic of Egypt, aimed at stopping Oatar's support for extremism and terrorism, and forcing it to abandon policies which have destabilized our region.
We are committed to protecting our national interests, the security of the Arabian Gulf, and the stability of our region. Some parties in our region are making alliances with organisations that seek to undermine peace and security in the Arab region and the world. This is a gamble that they will lose. It is behavior that we should not accept. Let us stand united against those who finance, promote and justify extremism and terrorism.
We have a clear choice with no alternative: to stand against terrorism in all its manifestations and to stand against all perpetrators without exception. We must demonstrate zero tolerance to those who spread violence, fear and destruction among innocent people, and those who provide support and safe haven to terrorist groups. The sovereign measures taken by my country in cooperation with its close allies serve this purpose. They are consistent with international law and are intended to protect Arab national security and counter Oatar's support for terrorism.
Fourth: to promote compassion, tolerance and inclusion. Today more than ever, the Arab region is in great need of these values to counter the misleading messages and ideologies spread by extremist and terrorist groups, especially through social media platforms. My country works with regional and international partners to put in place mechanisms which remind our youth of our shared human values and counter the rhetoric of the terrorists. Specifically, the UAE established and hosts specialized institutions such as the ""Sawab"" Center, the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism ""Hedayah"", as well as the""Muslim Council of Elders"" which aims to demonstrate the peaceful nature of our Islamic religion, and the ""Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim
3


Societies"" which consolidates the principle of peace among Muslims. We have learned from experience that we must expose extremist and terrorist rhetoric and defeat it intellectually, and provide an alternative narrative based on the principle of peaceful coexistence and tolerance.
While these institutions promote a culture of peaceful coexistence and tolerance, we regret that some countries fund media platforms which call for violence, incite hatred and sectarianism and provide a podium for the murderous ideology of terrorism. History has repeatedly proven the catastrophic consequences that follow when media platforms incite people to commit violence and justify it.
Mr. President,
Our international efforts to achieve peace in the region will not be successful without ending the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arab territories which has lasted over seven decades. This situation makes young people vulnerable to exploitation by terrorist groups who claim that they are the only choice through which they can achieve their aspirations.
The common factor in all crises suffered in the region and the real obstacle to any concrete progress in resolving these crises remains the hostile and expansionist policy of Iran in the region. That policy is one of interference in the internal affairs of other states, and of arming and supporting terrorist groups, such as the Houthis and Hezbollah, as well as terrorist groups and cells in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom of Bahrain and Kuwait. Iran has not only committed blatant violations of the principles of sovereignty, but also continues to exploit the crises in the Arab world to undermine regional security by inciting and fueling conflict. Iran must realize that peaceful co-existence based on respect for sovereignty in the region is the best basis for a harmonious relationship with the states of the Arabian Gulf.
We reaffirm from this podium the UAE's firm position and its legitimate right to sovereignty over its three islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which are occupied by Iran in violation of the provisions of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We will not abandon our demand for Iran to return the occupied islands to their rightful owners, either voluntarily or through the peaceful means that are available for the resolution of international disputes, particularly through the International Court of Justice.
Two years have passed since Iran's nuclear agreement, with no sign of change in its hostile behavior in the region or any desire to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Instead, Iran
4

continues to develop and conduct more ballistic missile tests in a deliberate violation of the spirit of the nuclear agreement. Therefore, we support enhancing controls on Iran's nuclear program and continued assessment of the agreement and its provisions.
We view the similarly provocative behavior of North Korea, through its continued development of its nuclear program and ballistic missiles, as a part of the destructive efforts of these states to pursue their nuclear ambitions and threaten global security and stability. The aggressive policies of Iran and North Korea are inconsistent with their membership in an international organization whose primary concern is the maintenance of international peace and security.
Mr. President,
If we are to restore security in the region and protect its peoples from conflicts and extremism, then we must make development, in both its human and strategic dimensions, our top priority. We must create opportunities and hope for young generations looking to a tomorrow with optimism and confidence. Therefore, my country is committed to achieving economic and human progress, and to contribute to rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in conflict-affected countries, in order to enable their national institutions to undertake their role in restoring security and stability.
The UAE continues its humanitarian approach to alleviate the suffering of refugees. It Supports international and regional efforts to protect them and improve their conditions by providing humanitarian and development assistance. However, the UAE stresses that managing crises by providing only humanitarian and development assistance is not a sustainable solution if we do not address the root causes of such crises.
In this regard, we reiterate the need for the United Nations to assume its responsibilities in finding solutions to humanitarian and political crises and addressing their grave implications, especially with regard to the recent violence and ethnic cleansing committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar. The United Arab Emirates condemns the acts of violence, and displacement and collective punishment, committed against the Rohingya and affirms that it will continue to provide humanitarian assistance and support efforts taken to reduce their suffering.
In this context also, we refer to the obstinate rejection by the Houthi rebels in Yemen of a political settlement to the Yemeni crisis and of humanitarian initiatives there. We see this clearly in their disruption and delay of numerous relief efforts and initiatives aimed at responding effectively to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Yemen. Despite this,
5

we will continue to work determinedly through the Arab coalition under the wise leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the political and humanitarian processes with the utmost vigour and determination. We will strive to address the humanitarian and development needs of the Yemeni people, especially women and children, and restore stability.
Mr. President,
The UAE believes that it is by looking to the future, promoting humane values and human development, and responding to the aspirations of young people that peoples and nations can best advance their own development and prosperity. Today, my country has moved beyond the establishment of infrastructure and fulfillment of basic needs, including the provision of health, nutrition and education services, and adopted a model which is based on the principles of good governance and values of tolerance according to a vision for building happy societies. In addition, my country has ensured the provision of a safe environment to enable women and youth to fulfill their dreams and ambitions, and engage in the development of their country. This has allowed the UAE to pioneer innovations and ground-breaking achievements, and to become a beacon of hope for the younger generation throughout the region. The UAE is cognizant that its greatest challenge is to make its development sustainable and prepare itself for the post-oil era. This is a vital endeavor and it is our goal in every action that we undertake.
The UAE considers these values and principles a human and historic legacy passed on and celebrated by generations. Therefore, we have declared 2o18 to be the ""Year of Zayed"" in memory and recognition of the achievements of the founding father of the United Arab Emirates, and to enshrine his values as we continue his journey to build and advance the nation.
Mr. President, we stand before a historic juncture. On the one hand stand those who pursue peace, development, modernity and the future. On the other, those who choose darkness, destruction, sabotage and chaos. In this most necessary and just confrontation, we must stand united. Our goal must be the eradication of extremism and terrorism and the elimination of those forces that are tearing our Arab region apart. Our path will then be clear, towards a future that is brighter and full of hope.
Thank you.

United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland,"Mr President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my sincere condolences to the government and people of Mexico following the devastating earthquake. I also want to reiterate my sympathies to those affected by the recent hurricanes in the Caribbean. Our thoughts are with them all at this time.
As we meet at this General Assembly we face challenges that go right to the heart of who we are as nations. Challenges that test our values, our vision and our resolve to defend the rules and standards that underpin the security and prosperity of our fellow citizens. As I argued in my speech here last year, many of these challenges do not recognize or respect geographical boundaries. I think of course of the terrorism that has struck so many of our countries including my own 5 times this year. And fueling that terrorist threat the increasing numbers being drawn to extremist ideologies not only in places riven by conflict and instability, but many online in their homes thousands of miles away from those conflicts. I think of the climate change which is depleting and degrading the planet we leave to our children.
And I think of the vast challenges that come from the mass displacement of people. Many are refugees fleeing conflict and persecution. Others, economic migrants, prepared to risk everything on perilous sea crossings in the desperate search for a better life for themselves and their children. Through this migration we also see the challenges of economic inequality between countries and within them. This inequality,

together with weaknesses in the global trading system, threatens to undermine support for the forces of liberalism and free trade that have done so much to propel global growth. And it is pushing some countries towards protectionism in the belief that this best defends the interests of their own people.
And as the global system struggles to adapt we are confronted by states deliberately flouting for their own gain the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security. The unforgiveable use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against its own people and perhaps foremost in our minds today the outrageous proliferation of nuclear weapons by North Korea and a threat to use them.
I believe that the only way for us to respond to this vast array of challenges is to come together and defend the international order that we have worked so hard to create and the values by which we stand. For it is the fundamental values that we share, values of fairness, justice and human rights, that have created the common cause between nations to act together in our shared interest and form the multilateral system. And it is this rules-based system which we have developed, including the institutions, the international frameworks of free and fair trade, agreements such as the Paris Climate Accord and laws and conventions like the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which enables the global cooperation through which we can protect those values.
Indeed, the defining purpose of the UN Charter is to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among nations, to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character; and to be a centre for harmonising the actions of nations in the attainment of those common ends. And I do not see these as vaunted ideals to be held for their own sake. These values and the rules they imbue are central to our national interest, to our security and prosperity. And the international system with the UN at its heart is the amplifying force that enables countries to cooperate and live up to the standards in word, spirit and deed, to our collective and individual benefit.
If this system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time then there will be a crisis of faith in

multilateralism and global cooperation that will damage the interests of all our peoples. So those of us who hold true to our shared values, who hold true to that desire to defend the rules and high standards that have shaped and protected the world we live in, need to strive harder than ever to show that institutions like this United Nations can work for the countries that form them and for the people who we represent.
This means reforming our United Nations and the wider international system so it can prove its worth in helping us to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. And it means ensuring that those who flout the rules and spirit of our international system are held to account, that nations honor their responsibilities and play their part in upholding and renewing a rules-based international order that can deliver prosperity and security for us all.
Reform
First, we must ensure that our multilateral institutions can deliver the aspirations on which they were founded. Think of UNHCR looking after those who've been driven out of their homes. The OPCW striving for a world free of chemical weapons. UNICEF helping children in danger. These are all vital missions where the UN surely has a unique role to play. And that is why the UK has over 70 years been such a pioneering supporter of these organisations and more.
But we should also acknowledge that throughout its history the UN has suffered from a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery. When the need for multilateral action has never been greater the shortcomings of the UN and its institutions risk undermining the confidence of states as members and donors. Even more importantly they risk the confidence and faith of those who rely upon the blue helmets, who rely upon that sign I stand in front of today coming to their aid in the darkest of hours.
So we must begin by supporting the ambitious reform agenda that Secretary-General Guterres is now leading to create a more agile, transparent and joined-up organisation. Much of this work will be practical and unglamorous. It will require the UN to deliver better

cooperation on the ground between agencies, remove competition for funding and improve gender equality. But it will also require real leadership to confront damaging issues that have beset the UN. So I welcome the Secretary-General's new circle of leadership on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse in UN operations and I'm pleased to be part of this initiative.
We, the nations of the UN, need to give the Secretary-General our backing for these reforms and as an outward-looking global Britain and the second biggest funder of the UN the UK will remain committed to spending 0.7% of GNI on development and humanitarian support. We will use our military to support peacekeeping and our diplomats will continue to work to tackle conflict and support peace building. In turn the UN and its agencies must win our trust in proving to us and to the people we represent that they can deliver. And that is why we will remain generous in our funding but set aside 30% to be paid only to those parts of the UN that achieve sufficient results.
But this is about more than technical reforms, important as they are. It is also about reforms that enable the United Nations to truly respond to the global challenges of the 21st century. At last year's General Assembly we undertook to do far more to resolve the challenges of refugee and migration flows. We agreed to develop global compacts to address the causes and the consequences of the mass movements of people we see today. This was an important step to elevate significantly our global response and enable us collectively to tackle this challenge of our times.
So in the year ahead as well as agreeing the principles of these compacts we must ensure they can be applied in practice. We must do more to identify, protect and support refugees and those hosting them near conflicts. And on migration our starting point must be that it can benefit both countries and migrants themselves but only when it is safe, orderly, well-managed and legal. If we do not manage this effectively, we will fail both our own citizens and those taking these dangerous journeys. And we will push more people into the curse of modern slavery and the hands of the human traffickers and organised criminal groups that drive this inhuman industry.

But the steps we are agreeing through these compacts alone will not be enough. For if people cannot find jobs, opportunity and hope for themselves and their families where they live they will continue to look elsewhere. And so as the United Nations and as members, we must work harder to combine the efforts of our development programmes with the private sector and the international financial institutions. To support the creation of jobs and livelihoods that will address not just the consequences, but the causes of this great challenge of our time. For the truth is that despite our best efforts, we are not succeeding. We must do more.
The same is true with terrorism, where again the challenges we face today are vastly different from those of previous eras. When terrorists struck London and Manchester this year, the world saw our cities come together in defiance. Our parliament carries on. Ariana Grande came back to Manchester and sang again. London Bridge is bustling with people. Our communities came together at the Finsbury Park mosque in North London. And Londoners got back on the Tube. The terrorists did not win, for we will never let anyone destroy our way of life.
But defiance alone is not enough. As leaders, we have all visited too many hospitals, and seen too many innocent people murdered in our countries. In the last decade, hundreds of thousands have been killed by terrorists across the world. This is a truly global tragedy that is increasingly touching the lives of us all. This year is the tenth anniversary of the death of the woman who introduced me to my husband, and who was known well to many of us in this United Nations. Benazir Bhutto was brutally murdered by people who actively rejected the values that all of us here in this United Nations stand for. In a country that has suffered more than most at the hands of terrorists. Murdered for standing up for democracy, murdered for espousing tolerance, and murdered for being a woman.
When I think of the hundreds of thousands of victims of terrorism in countries across the world, I think of their friends, their families, their communities, devastated by this evil, and I say enough is enough. So of course, we must continue to take the fight to these terrorist groups on the battlefield. And the UK will remain at the forefront of this effort, while also helping to build the capabilities of our alliances and our partners to

better take on this challenge. And we must also step up our efforts as never before to tackle the terrorist use of the internet. For as the threat from terrorists evolves, so must our cooperation. And that is why today, for the first time in the UN, governments and industry through the Global Internet Forum for Counterterrorism will be coming together to do just that.
The tech companies have made significant progress on this issue, but we need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to reduce terrorist content online, and to increase significantly their efforts to stop it being uploaded in the first place. This is a major step in reclaiming the internet from those who would use it to do us harm. But ultimately, it is not just the terrorists themselves who we need to defeat, it is the extremist ideologies that fuel them. It is the ideologies that preach hatred, so division and undermine our common humanity. We must be far more robust in identifying these ideologies and defeating them across all parts of our societies.
As I said in the aftermath of the attack on London Bridge this summer, we have to face the fact that this will require some difficult conversations. We all need to come together, to take on this extremism that lives among us, and to nurture the common values that must ultimately win out. These are the values of this United Nations. And yet, despite our best efforts, we as nations and as a United Nations have not found the ways or the means to truly take on this threat. And that is why today, as I talk about UN reform, I ask the Secretary General to make this fight against terrorists and the ideologies that drive them a core part of his agenda, at the heart of our development, peace building, and conflict prevention work. And to give this effort the prominence it surely requires. I'm calling on the Secretary General to make this a theme of next year's General Assembly and use this to harness the efforts of governments, the private sector, and civil society so that we can truly strike the generational blow against this vile evil in our world.
And as we do so, we must clearly strike the balance between protecting our people and protecting their freedoms. And we must always guard against those who would use the fight against terrorism as a cover for oppression and the violation of human rights. So as we look at the situation in Northern Burma, I call on the Burmese authorities to put an

end to the violence, allow humanitarian access, and fully implement Annan Commission recommendations.
Responsibilities
And so by reforming our multinational institutions, we can strengthen their ability to deliver for the people we serve, protect the vulnerable and fight injustice. We can enable multilateralism to multiply the effect of our individual commitments through its convening power and spending power. Through the economies of scale it can bring, the standards it can set, the moral leadership it can harness, and the legitimacy it can confer. But multilateralism can only reflect the values that individual states project, and can only multiply the commitments that they are prepared to make. It is strong nations that form strong institutions, and which provide the basis of the international partnerships and cooperation that brings stability to our world.
And so it falls to us all to decide whether we will honor the responsibilities that we have to one another. I've talked about the role of the UN in stepping up on counterterrorism. But this is an area that we as states have critical responsibilities, which the UN cannot itself address alone, for it is inescapable that the terrorism conflict and the instability that we see across the world is in many cases driven by the actions of states acting through proxies.
So when countries back groups like Hezbollah to increase instability and conflict across the Middle East, support so-called separatists in Ukraine to create instability on Europe's eastern borders, or give tacit support to criminal groups launching cyber-attacks against our countries and institutions, they call into question the very rules and international systems that protect us. And that is why, both globally, but also in our own continent of Europe, the UK will remain steadfast in our commitment and responsibility to ensure the security and stability of our friends and allies as we have done for generations.
And just as it the responsibility of nations not to seek to advance their interests through terrorist or proxy groups, so it is also the responsibility of each of is to act together in the face of the most egregious violations

of our common rules and standards. Clearly responsibility for the chaos and tragedy that we see in Syria lies firmly at the door of Asaad. He and his backers have continually frustrated the efforts of the UN to act as the broker of peace through the Geneva Process. As responsible states, we must not abandon our support for the UN's attempts to secure peace and stability in Syria. And indeed, we must continue to call on all those with influence on the regime to bring them to the table.
But in recent weeks, the UN has also confirmed what we all new, namely that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on its own people. In the face of that, we have a responsibility to stand up, to hold the Syrian regime to account. This responsibility sits with us all, but a particular special responsibility lies on the shoulders of the permanent members of the security council. And as one of these five members, the United Kingdom takes our special responsibility seriously.
So I am proud that we have used the full weight of our diplomacy to ensure that we have not had to exercise our veto in a generation. Seeking to foster international cooperation, not frustrated. But others have not done so. One country in particular has used its veto as many times in the last five years as in the whole of the second half of the Cold War. And in so doing, they have prevented action against a despicable regime that has murdered its own people with chemical weapons. As a result, in Syria, the United Nations has been blocked. This has undermined the values that we hold dear, and the international rules based system that is the basis of security and prosperity around the world.
Now we face an even more immediate, global danger in the activities of Kim Jong Un and his regime in DPRK. Time after time he's shown contempt for the international community of law-abiding states. Contempt for his neighbors and contempt for the institutions and rules that have preserved peace and security. On this challenge, the UN in recent weeks has shown it can step up to the task. With last Monday's security council resolution creating the biggest sanctions package of the 21st Century. We have seen regional and global powers coming together and as in its founding charter putting aside limited self-interests to show leadership on behalf of the wider world. But despite these efforts, DPRK continues to defy and provoke the international community and

threaten its neighbors. And unless all security council members continue to live up to the special responsibilities that are placed upon us, and in seeking to resolve this crisis, be prepared to take on necessary measures to tackle this threat, we will not be able to bring stability to the Korean Peninsula.
So as the world looks on, I am calling for further steps and for nations with this special responsibility to work together and exert the pressure we know is necessary to force Kim Jong Un to change his ways. Let us not fail this time. Let our message to North Korea be clear. Our determination to uphold these rules is stronger by far than their determination to undermine them.
Mr. President, throughout the history of this United Nations, countries have shown time and time again that by being true to our values, rules, and standards, it is possible to come together and to deliver in ways that have the most extraordinary impact on the lives of the people we serve. I believe we can do so again. We must do so again, and we will do so again. Thank you."
United_Republic_of_Tanzania,"Your Excellency, Mr. President; Your Excellency, Mr. Secretary-Qeneral; Excellencies Heads of State and Government;
Excellencies Heads of Delegatio|is;
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I congratulate you Mr. President on your election to preside over the deliberations of
this august Seventy-Second Assembly of the United Nations. My delegation pledges
full support to you and your Bureau.
Allow me also to convey warm fraternal greetings from H.E. Dr. John Pombe Joseph
Magufuh, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who wished to be here but due to other pressing commitments at home is unable to attend this Session of the Assembly. President Magufuli has sent me to assure this Assembly that his Government will continue to support the United Nations and its noble mandate to promote global peace, security, freedom and development. He also wishes to extend
Tanzania's imwavering support and cooperation to the Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres as he continues to discharge his duties.
Mr. President^ My delegation pays tribute to your predecessor H.E. Ambassador Peter Thompson, for the exemplary leadership during the 71st Session of the United
Nations General Assembly. His tireless efforts in promoting the implementation of the Agenda 2030; his dedication to resolving the plight of refugees and migrants; and reviving consultations on the reforms of the United Nations particularly on the Security Council will remain part of his legacy. It is my expectation that you and your team will advance from where he left off as you have pledged in your opening
statement.
Theme
Mr. President, the world today is facing myriad of challenges which include new
and old security threats such as international terrorism and other transnational
1

crimes, persisting poverty, hunger, climate change as well as global inequalities in economic and social status among nations. These challenges call for common and
urgent response by the entire United Nations system and the international
community as a whole.
It is in this regard that my delegation welcomes the theme for this Session ""Focusing
on People: Striving for peace and g decent life for all on a sustainable planet**. This theme is timely and welcomed as most of our countries are recalibrating their development strategies and plans to ensiore the speedy and timely implementation of the goals and targets enshrined in the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development.
Implementation ofSDGs
Mr. President, striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet should focus on ending poverty, promoting economic and social prosperity, addressing inequality and injustices as well as tackling the impacts of climate change. This can be achieved by successfully implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Cognizant of this fact, Tanzania has integrated the
SDGs into the Second Phase of the Five Year Development Plan 2016-2021 focusing
on industrialization.
This plan is a tool towards the realization of our National Development Vision, (Vision 2025). In collaboration with development partners and other stakeholders,
we have developed frameworks for implementing the SDGs which include communication and dissemination strategies on SDGs to make the goals understood
to eveiyone. Dissemination is in both English and Kiswahili, our national language spoken by all Tanzanians. Sensitisation workshops on SDGs are also being
conducted to regional administrations and local government authorities so that the
goals can be mainstreamed in their local plans and budgets in order to directly
affect the ordinary people who are the main focus of the 2030 Agenda.
Mr. President, Tanzania has set a target growth from an average of 7 percent in 2015 to 10 percent by 2020 in order to reach a middle income status by 2025. We

also believe that this growth will ensure equity in the society by reducing the unemployment rate from the current 10.3 percent to 8 percent and reduce proportion of population below poverty line from the current 28.2 percent to 16.7 percent by 2020. This growth can be achieved by, among other things, increasing employment in both rural and urban areas; providing financial support through soft
loans to youth and women; strengthening small and medium enterprises; securing fair taxation and fiscal regimes from business entities as well as restoring discipline and accountability while addressing corruption and controlling public spending.
Fighting corruption, financial discipline and accountability in all sectors is the
hallmark of President Magufuli's Government.
Climate Change
Mr. President, climate change has become an existential challenge to the entire planet earth. All parts of the world are increasingly experiencing the adverse effects and impact of climate change manifested in persistent droughts, land degradation, coastal erosion, ocean temperature rise, extreme weather events such as cyclones,
typhoons, hurricanes and floods. In Tanzania for instance, it is disheartening to
witness the epic snows and glaciers of Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa
melting fast.
Against this background, I would like to express my Government's heartfelt sjmipathies and condolences to our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean, South
Asia, Mexico, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, USA and all aroimd the world who have recently
been victims ofimpacts ofclimate change. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.
For all of us, this should be a wakeup call and a reminder that climate change has no boimdanes and can potentially wipe off economic and development achievements
in a blink of an eye. Therefore, the sooner we act the better chances we have to protect the planet earth for the present and future generations.
Mr. President, it is fortunate that we have the Paris Agreement that already entered into force in November 2016 to address this problem. To honour our joint efforts
3

tiiat gave birth to the Paris Agreement under the leadership of France, we should implement in letter and spirit all of its articles. Assistance to developing countries should go beyond mere mitigation measures and target adaptation measures with built in green technologies to control carbon emissions from the outset.
Conflicts
Mr. President, violent conflicts continue to plague the world and remain a challenge to the United Nations and the Security Council in particular which has the primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. They claim thousands of lives and lead to massive displacements and flights of people to safer
places. We need to invest more on conflict prevention, resolution and mediation
efforts by addressing the root causes, precipitating and triggering factors to conflicts. Peace keeping, peace building and state building are essential to the
maintenance and consolidation where peace has been secured.
Mr. President, striving for peace is a task for us all governments, international organisations, regional blocs, non-state actors, religious groups, civil societies and individuals. The renewal of our efforts is paramoimt to ensure that we achieve sustainable peace and security, which is a perquisite for the achievement of
sustainable development.
In this regard, we commend our n:^en and women in blue helmets who are sacrificing their lives to serve the heroic cause of peacekeeping. Tanzania, with other countries, has been contributing troops to UN Peacekeeping Missions. We have paid a high
price by the loss of peacekeepers. We nonetheless remain steadfast for this noble
and human endeavour.
It is only this week that Tanzania lost its soldier in the DRC following an attack from the ADF rebels. We condemn this' cowardly act in the strongest possible terms. We urge the United Nations Security Council to continue strengthening operational capability of FIB in MONUSCO in order to be able to effectively deal with negative
forces and asymmetrical warfare in the Eastern DRC.
4

Burundi
Mr. President, Tanzania has maintained its record as a peaceful country upholding
the rule of law, democracy and other principles of good governance. It has been a
country of refuge to many for decades. At the same time, Tanzania has been actively participating in regional and international peace initiatives including the ongoing Burundi peace process, an East African Commimity initiative facilitated by former President Mkapa of Tanzania and mediated by President Museveni of Uganda.
The peace talks are still on track albeit their slow and halting pace. It is encouraging
to note that in some parts of Burundi, the security situation has significantly improved to permit the voluntary return of some 12,000 refugees out of almost 250,000 refugees who have been in Tanzania since 2015. We appreciate the partnership we have with the UNBCR in protecting and assisting the refugees in our
country.
DRC
Mr. President, Tanzania has also intermittently for decades been receiving and hosting refugees from pockets of troubled areas in the Eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We trust that there will be fully implementation of the December 31st Peace Agreement with the promise of timely elections in the coimtry. We urge the DRC leadership to live up to that commitment. In this regard, we urge the international community to extend both logistical and financial support to DRC to complete the registration of voter's register and carry out expeditiously the
planned elections.
NonSelf Governing Territories
Mr. President, on the agenda of the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations, there are two protracted problems which require decisive action.
One is the issue of self-determination of the Sahrawi people. With the return of Morocco mto the Afncan Union fold, expectations are high in Africa that negotiations

on this issue which is on the agenda of the Security Council will receive renewed
momentum and agency.
Mr. President, on Palestine, we support the two-state solution living side by side in
peaceful co-existence. To that end, the elements of a viable State of Palestine must
be ensured and respected. The long stalled peace process in the Middle East must be rekindled with a series of acceptable confidence building measures by both sides
with the support and guarantee of the United Nations and the international community in its entirety.
Unilateral Sanctions and Embargos
Mr. President, we have in this Assembly been calling for the cessation of economic, commercial, financial and other embargos imposed on Cuba with infinitesimal results. The intention of the USA to reverse the agreements between the two coimtries on normalising relations is a set back to the progress that had been registered and applauded by all of us in this very same Assembly and beyond. Tanzania continues to call for the total removal of all embargos on Cuba. The people to people contact that has started between the people of Cuba and those of the
United States should serve as building blocks for enduring peaceful good
neighbour lines in the spirit of dialogue and understanding.
Nuclear Disarmament
Mr. President, after the end of the cold war, there were new dawn and bright
prospects for both conventional and nuclear disarmament.
The doctrine of nuclear deterrence was becoming absolute, reduction of nuclear arsenals was making progress towards a nuclear ban treaty including nuclear testing and some aspirants for nuclear weapons abandoned their ambitions. However, the recent developments in the DPRK have shattered these optimistic prospects. The world is being dragged back to nuclear brinkmanship. This is the most recent threat to international peace and security. Tanzania supports all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council on the nuclear weapons trends in the

DPRK, calls for de-escalation of the political warfare and the renewal of the dialogue
under the auspices of the six parties initiative.
On the other hand, Tanzania commends the recent adoption of the Nuclear Ban Treaty which puts nuclear weapons in the same legal ground as other Weapons of Mass Destruction. We should all support this Treaty in order to increase our moral authority in the fight against nuclear weapons proliferation.
United Nations Reforms
Mr. President, the reforms of the United Nations to make the Organization more efficient and relevant to cope with the new trends and challenges must be continuous and progressive. The latest initiative by the Secretary General is a commendable effort which should have received a consensual support by the entire UN membership. We hope in the process of implementing these latest reform proposals, the debates will be all inclusive and progress will be made on the basis of
consensus.
The delay in the reforms of the Security Council is testing the political will of the key
players on this matter; the debate on this serious matter has now become routine
and sterile. The status quo is undercutting the primary responsibility of the Council
in the maintenance of international peace and security. Democratizing the Security
Council is good for the Council and the world in this 21^ Century.
Conclusion
Mr. President,
Excellencies Heads of State and Government,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

In conclusion, I wish to return to the 2030 Agenda by giving a clarion call to the United Nations and its member states to implement the goals contained therein in a measured and agreed benchmarks and intervals. The economic and social benefits
from well implemented goals will enhance democracy, freedom and security at the
national, regional and international levels without leaving no one behind.
/ thank you for your kind attention!!"
United_States_of_America,"Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.
As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.
Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high -- a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.
Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.
We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.
But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region

of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.
International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.
To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.
We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.
This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.
It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars -- they're pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, ""Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.""
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.
We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.

Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.
Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.
In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.
This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.
The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are: ""We the people.""
Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.
In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.
As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. 
All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nationstate remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America's interests above all else.
But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it's in everyone's interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.
That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?
If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.
The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.
If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.
No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.
We were all witness to the regime's deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it

in the assassination of the dictator's brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea's spies.
If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.
It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.
The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That's what the United Nations is all about; that's what the United Nations is for. Let's see how they do.
It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved.
But we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.
We face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime -- one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.
The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran's leaders are, in fact, its own people.
Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran's people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad's dictatorship, fuel Yemen's civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.
We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. The Iran Deal was one of the

worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it -- believe me.
It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran's government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.
The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.
Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation's proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?
The Iranian regime's support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.
In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.
We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.
We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.
The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.
Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.
I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat

of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.
We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens -- even innocent children -- shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.
We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.
For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.
For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.
For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.
For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.
I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.
We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President's Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women

Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.
We also thank --  -- we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.
In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution's noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.
The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.
Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.
The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.
That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.
The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.
The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.

As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.
The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.
We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.
I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.
The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.
America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.
For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.
While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America's strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.
If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the ""independent

strength of its members."" If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations -- nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.
In remembering the great victory that led to this body's founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.
Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.
Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.
We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats -- we can't do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?
One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was ""effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people.""
That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.
The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.

History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.
Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.
This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.
So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.
Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much."
Uzbekistan,"Dear Mr. Chairman! Your Excellencies! Ladies and Gentlemen!
Allow me to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to speak from the high rostrum of the United Nations.
A few weeks ago, our people broadly celebrated the 26th anniversary of Uzbekistan's state independence.
Today, Uzbekistan is rapidly developing. Carefully preserving the wisdom of past generations, we are consciously going towards resolute reforms and are committed to forming a new image of the country.
The political activity is growing with profound reforms are being implemented in all spheres. Their goal is to build a democratic state and a just society, where the priority is implementation of a simple and clear principle - <<The human interests come first>>.
Following the results of the nationwide discussion, the five-year Development Strategy of Uzbekistan was adopted. While developing it, as if we have looked at ourselves from outside, so as not only to objectively assess our potential and opportunities, but also pay a close attention to our failures and mistakes.
The strategy is the program of real actions of renewal. It is already being put into practice.
We have declared the year 2017 as the Year of Dialogue with People and Human Interests in our country. Our goal is to strengthen the mechanisms that make the people's power in the country not nominal, but real.
We are deeply convinced: the people must not serve the government bodies, rather the government bodies must serve the people.
We have established the Virtual and People's Reception Offices of the President all over the country. Over a million of citizens have resolved their urgent problems with the help of these Reception Offices.
In cooperation with the International Labor Organization, we have taken effective measures to eradicate the child and forced labor.
Following the visit of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mr. A1 Hussein, a program of measures to strengthen the guarantees of human rights protection was developed.
We have abolished such an outdated legacy of the past as exit visas, which were limiting the freedom of movement.
An open dialogue with national and international non-governmental organizations on protection of human rights is being intensified.
Proceeding from the principles of humanism, many individual cases of detention of persons in custody have been reviewed. The stumbled citizens who came under the influence of the ideology of extremism are undergoing a social rehabilitation with conditions being created for them to return to a normal life.
Now the activities of all law enforcement agencies in terms of protection of human rights and freedoms are under constant parliamentary and civil supervision.

2
The role of political parties and civil society is growing, and the true independence of the judiciary is being ensured. The role of mass media has significantly increased.
The most important vector of reforms is liberalization of the economic system and creation of favorable investment climate. We proceed from one simple truth: the richer the people are - the stronger shall be the state.
From the beginning of this month, Uzbekistan has completely switched to free conversion of the national currency. Along with this, all necessary measures are taken to mitigate any possible negative consequences for the population.
For the first time the Institute of the Ombudsman for the Protection of the Rights of Entrepreneurs was established. The taxes on business were significantly reduced. The access of business to credits was expanded. New free economic zones have been launched, where investors are granted extensive benefits.
The cooperation with international financial institutions is successfully deve!oping and partnership with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was renewed.
I want to note that the content of the Strategy is fully consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Dear participanCs of the session: We are convinced that the United Nations must continue to play a central role in international relations, Uzbekistan stands for its gradual reform. We believe that, in accordance with the realities of the modem world, the Security Council needs to be expanded. We support the steps taken by the new leadership of the United Nations to improve the system of its management. I want to confirm -Uzbekistan will continue close partnership with the UN structures. We are determined to ensure the practical implementation of the <<road map>> developed following the recent visit of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Uzbekistan.
Ladies and Gentlemen: Today, Uzbekistan considers the region of Central Asia to be as the main priority of its foreign policy. And this is a conscious choice. Being in the heart of Central Asia, Uzbekistan is keenly interested in the region to become a zone of stability, sustainable development and good-neighborliness. A peaceful and economically prosperous Central Asia is our most important goal and key task. Uzbekistan is determined to engage in dialogue, constructive interaction and strengthening the good-neighborliness. We stand ready for reasonable compromises with the countries of Central Asia on all issues without exception. Thanks to joint efforts in recent months, the level of political confidence has significantly increased in the region. Fundamentally important decisions on many issues were found.

2:
3
Signing the Treaty on the State border between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan in early September this year became a truly landmark event. A breakthrough in this very sensitive issue achieved for the first time in 26 years became possible thanks to political will demonstrated by parties and the readiness to find mutually acceptable solutions.
In a word, absolutely new political atmosphere was created in the region in a short period of time.
I believe that holding the regular consultation meetings of the heads of Central Asian states would facilitate the consolidation of this trend.
We intend to discuss the fundamental problems of the region at the High-Level International Conference ""Central Asia: One Past and Common Future, Cooperation for Sustainable Development and Prosperity>> to be held under the aegis of the United Nations in Samarkand in November.
Based on its results, we intend to make a proposal on the adoption of a special resolution of the General Assembly in support of the efforts of the states of Central Asia in terms of ensuring security and enhancing regional cooperation.
We count on the support of this proposal by the leadership of the United Nations and the international community.
Distinguished Mr. Chairman: Speaking about the problems of ensuring security and stability in Central Asia, one cannot overlook such an important issue as the joint use of the region's shared
water resources.
We fully share the position of the UN Secretary-General that ""the problems of water, peace and security are inextricably linked"".
I am convinced that there is no alternative to addressing the water problem other than equally taking into account the interests of the countries and nations of the region.
Uzbekistan supports the draft conventions on the use of water resources of the Amudarya and Syrdarya river basins developed by the United Nations Regional Center for Preventive Diplomacy.
I would like to once again draw your attention to one of the most acute ecological problems of our time - the Aral Sea catastrophe.
I am holding the map of the Aral tragedy in my hands. I believe, comments are unnecessary here.
Overcoming the consequences of desiccation of the sea requires today the active consolidation of international efforts.
We stand for full implementation of the special UN Program to provide effective assistance to the population affected by the Aral Sea crisis adopted this year.
Ladies and Gentlemen: Stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan is an important condition to ensure not only regional but global security, as well.

4
We are convinced that the only way to peace in Afghanistan is a direct dialogue among the central government and main domestic political forces without preconditions.
The negotiations should be Afghan-led on the territory of Afghanistan and under the auspices of the United Nations. The wise Afghan people have the right to independently define their own destiny.
We support the appeal of the administration of the U.S. President Mr. Donald Trump to Afghanistan's neighbor-states to promote the peace process of the interAfghan settlement.
Uzbekistan has been making and will continue its contribution to the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan, development of its transport and energy infrastructure, training of national personnel.
I am convinced that Afghanistan must remain at the heart of the global agenda. The efforts of the international community should primarily be aimed at resolving acute social and economic problems of Afghanistan.
Our common determination to promote peace in this long-suffering country should not be weakened.
Dear participants of the session! The aggravation of terrorist threats in the world, especially in recent years, indicates that the use of mainly forceful methods of counteraction does not justify itself. Often the efforts are reduced to combating the consequences of challenges, rather than their root causes. I believe that along with other factors, ignorance and intolerance are at the heart of international terrorism and extremism. In this regard, the most important task is to fight for the minds of people, especially young people. Most of the crimes linked with extremist activity and violence are committed by the people under the age of 30. Today's youth is the largest generation in the history of mankind totaling 2 billion people. The planet's future and well-being depend on what kind of people our children will grow up into. Our key task is to provide conditions for self-realization of the youth, create a barrier against the spread of the ""virus"" of the ideology of violence. We believe that for this we need to develop the multilateral cooperation in the sphere of social support of the younger generation, protection of its rights and interests. In this regard, Uzbekistan proposes to develop the UN International Convention on the Rights of Youth - a unified international legal instrument aimed at the formation and implementation of youth policy in the conditions of globalization and rapid development of information and communication technologies. In our opinion, the signatory-states must make firm commitments to raise this sphere to the level of one of the main, vital priorities of their social policy.

................... _.T_m2 .............
We consider communicating the truly humanistic essence of Islam to a broad world community as the most important task.
We cherish our sacred religion as the focal point of time-honored values. We strongly condemn and we will never reconcile with those who rank our great faith together with violence and bloodshed.
Islam calls us to kindness and peace, preservation of a genuine human beginning.
I would like to especially note the invaluable contribution of a whole galaxy of outstanding representatives of the Central Asian Renaissance to the development of the Islamic and world civilization.
One of them - Imam Bukhari is acclaimed all over the world as the author of ""Sahib A1-Bukhari"", the second most important book in Islam after the Koran.
In order to preserve and study his richest legacy, disseminate his teachings on enlightened Islam, we decided to establish the Imam Bukhari International Research Center in Samarkand.
The activities of the Center for Islamic Civilization, which is being established in Tashkent, will contribute to implementation of this task.
I would like to address the participants of today's session with a proposal to adopt a special resolution of the General Assembly ""Education and religious
tolerance"".
Its main goal is to promote universal access to education, eradicate illiteracy and ignorance.
It is designed to promote tolerance and mutual respect, ensure religious freedom, protect the rights of believers, and prevent their discrimination.
Ladies and gentlemen! While maintaining the non-aligned status, Uzbekistan is open to dialogue. We are interested in expanding cooperation with all partners in the name of peace, progress and prosperity. In this we see a decisive condition for the successful implementation of the most important tasks of reforms carried out in our country, the main goal of which is a human, his needs and interests.
Thank you for your attention!"
Viet_Nam,"Mr. President,
I extend my warmest congratulations to His Excellency Miroslav Lajcak on his election as President of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
My special thanks shall also go to the Secretary-General and the Secretariat. Only in ten months, Mr. Guterres has already left his mark in the Organization's work for peace, development and human rights.
Mr. President, On 20 September i977, exactly forty years ago, Viet Nam was admitted to the United Nations as its 149th member. One day later, then Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister ofViet Nam stood right here at this podium, addressing this Assembly.
Representing a nation devastated by decades of war, he affirmed the unified Viet Nam;s pledge to closely cooperate with other Members in striving tirelessly to turn the lofty goals of the United Nations into reality -those are the goals of peace, national independence, democracy and social progress.
These forty years have been an era of transformations for my country.
Viet Nam today is a dynamic economy on the path of reforms and sustainable development. The country has transformed itself from an aid-dependent to a lower middle-income country. Our MDG implementation efforts have helped bring tens of millions of Vietnamese out of poverty.
But one thing has not changed. Viet Nam today is as a committed member of the United Nations as ever before. We are a staunch supporter and proponent of multilateralism with the United Nations at

its heart.
We believe in the fundamental role of international law and the UN Charter, the principles of respect for sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrit); noninterference, non-threat or use of force, and peaceful settlement of disputes.
Mr. President,
We gather here as the world undergoes profound and fast transformations. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, in particular the advancement of digital technology, is bringing about unprecedented opportunities for deveIopment for all. Enormous efforts to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are underway.
Yet, our world is still fraught with turmoil, uncertainties and fragility. While peace and cooperation prevails, people around the world are facing unprecedented challenges to their security and development. Security instability, the risks of conflicts, disasters and climate change threaten the sustainable development of all nations.
Terrorism and weapons of mass destruction have gone global and been threats to all. Efforts for disarmament, arms control, non-proliferation have not progressed as expected. The worst migration and humanitarian crisis since World War II continues to unfold.
For many past decades, the aspiration to live in peace remains a distant dream for millions 0fpeopte.
Together with the slow and unsustainable growth of global economy, globatization and economic integration are now facing a tess certain future. Inequality within and between countries remains one of the biggest challenges of our time. The impacts of climate change is evermore real, and far beyond forecast.
This year, we have witnessed multiple natural disasters, inflicting heavy losses in human life and property in Cuba, Mexico, the United States and other Caribbean countries.
Given these daunting challenges, the theme chosen for this Session - ""Focusing on the People: Striving for Peace and Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet"" could not have been more timely.
Mr. President,
With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the world community has in the clearest of ways chosen sustainable development as the path towards a better destiny for this and
future generations.
It is now incumbent upon us to bring this ambitious plan into reality, Developing countries should be given more favorable conditions and resources to realize the SDGs. We call on developed nations to fulfill their commitments on providing financial assistance and technology transfer for developing countries.

On this path towards sustainable development, we must place the interests of the people at the center of all our policies and actions. Failing to do so, we will not be able to ensure a decent life for all.

I believe life cannot be decent when poverty, unemployment and epidemics

remain unaddressed effectively. It cannot be decent if it continues to be threatened by

climate change and disasters.

i'

And above all, we will not succeed in our quest for sustainable development and

?

decent life for all unless we can secure sustainable peace.

i.

Mr. President,

Having enjoyed only the last four decades of peace and independence, we know what peace can bring about. Sustaining peace must always be on the top of our agenda.

This major undertaking will take strong commitment and cooperation. And I believe we will need to come together to strengthen multilateralism to achieve these goals.

For today's global challenges, multitateralism have indeed proven to provide the most effective solutions. Multilateral institutions are venues for countries to align their own interests, manage disputes and differences, and promote cooperation. But the trust on multilateralism will falter if these institutions fail to prove their effectiveness, or lack consensus on common goals and principles. Therefore, global and regional multilateral mechanisms should function in a transparent, effective and responsive manner.

The United Nations must be the center of coordination and linking joint efforts to address global challenges, building an ever more comprehensive system of rules and norms with a mechanism for ensuring objectiveness, fairness and equality. For it to do so, the United Nations need to undertake a comprehensive reform, from organizational structure and working methodology to the way the development resources are mobilized and allocated.

Viet Nam supports efforts to reform the United Nations in this direction and will participate responsibly in the reform process.

Mr. President,

International law is essential foundation for the order and stability in international relations. Wars, conflicts and tension today are occurring mainly because international  law has not been fully respected and observed in good faith. We believe that upholding international law, peace will be secured. We need to take concrete actions, in accordance with international law and the UN Charter, to prevent conflicts, build confidence and peacefully settle conflicts and disputes, including those in the Middle East, Africa and call for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. In the same vein, we find that the unilateral embargo against Cuba is inappropriate and and we call for its immediate removal.

We welcome the recent adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a historic milestone towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Today, I sign this Treaty and call upon others to sign and ratify the Treaty to enable its early entry into force. Let us all be clear. The danger of nuclear weapons still looms over mankind as long as they exist.
Mr. President,
The year 2017 also marks the 50th anniversary of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), to which Viet Nam is proud to be member. ASEAN is striving to a rules-based and people-oriented Community, to strengthen its centrality in the evolving regional architecture and actively contribute to peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.
Viet Nam is working closely with other ASEAN members to address common challenges. With regard t the South China Sea dispute, Viet Nam and ASEAN call upon all parties concerned to exercise self-restraint and settle disputes by peaceful means in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, fully respect diplomatic and legal processes, implement the Declaration on the Conduct of parties on the South China Sea (DOC) and expedite the completion Of an effective and legally binding Code of Conduct (COC).
Viet Nam also takes pride in hosting the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) this yeal, as we seek to build an Asia-Pacific partnership for sustainable and inclusive development in the 21 st century.
Mr. President,
At the global level, Viet Nam has actively engaged in the work of the United Nations, having served on the Human Rights Council between 2014-2016 and currently is a member of ECOSOC for the term 2016-2018. We have started to implement the National Plan of Action for implementing the Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement. And we will present the Voluntary National Review on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in 20!8. Viet Nam hosted last March the High-level UN Conference on transit trade facilitation for landlocked countries.
Since 2014, Viet Nam has sent its officers to work in UN peacekeeping missions in Africa and is preparing for the deployment of level-two field hospitals. Before that, since 2009, Viet Nam has presented its candidature for non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council for the term 2020-2021. We believe that these are the most practical ways to contribute to sustainable peace and security.
It is my confidence that through our concerted effort and the strength of multilateralism, we will fulfill our mission to maintain peace and security, ensure a decent life and a sustainable future for all.
Thank you very much./."
Zambia,"YOUR EXCELLENCY MR. MIROSLAV LAJCAK, PRESIDENT OF THE 72ND SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY,
. THE UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL MR. ANTONIO GUTERRES, ,) EXCELLENCIES, * DISTIGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
LET ME JOIN THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN CONGRATULATING YOUR EXCELLENCY MR. MIROSLAV LAJCAK ON THE ASSUMPTION OF THE PRESIDENCY OF .THE 72ND REGULAR SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND I ALSO CONVEY ZAMBIA'S SINCERE APPRECIATION TO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. PETER THOMSON, FOR HIS ABLE LEADERSHIP DURING THE 71sT SESSION.
LET ME ALSO SINCERELY CONGRATULATE H.E. MR. ANTONIO GUTERRES, FOR HIS ELECTION AS THE 9TM SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT HE WILL BUILD UPON THE STRONG FOUNDATION THAT WAS LAID BY HIS PREDECESSOR MR. BAN KI-MOON, TO WHOM I WISH TO PAY TRIBUTE FOR THE MANNER HE STEERED THIS ORGANISATION DURING HIS TENURE OF OFFICE.
MR. PRESIDENT,
THE THEME FOR THIS SESSION, 'FOCUSING ON PEOPLE: STRIVING FOR PEACE AND A DECENT LIFE FORALL ON A SUSTAINABLE PLANET' PRESENTS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE EXISTING MULTILATERAL APPROACHES TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AFFECTING OUR PEOPLES. THESE INCLUDE THREATS TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. THERE IS NEED TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AND RESPONSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WHICH INCLUDE TERRORISM, CLIMATE CHANGE, NUCLEAR WEAPONS, HIV/AIDS, AND MANY MORE.
IN THIS GLOBALISED AND INTER-DEPENDENT WORLD, NO COUNTRY, HOWEVER, WEALTHY OR POWERFUL, CAN RESOLVE ALL THESE CHALLENGES SINGLE HANDEDLY. COMMON SOLUTIONS ARE, THEREFORE, REQUIRED THROUGH A STRONG UNITED NATIONS.
MR. PRESIDENT,
THIS SESSION IS TAKING PLACE AGAINST A BACKDROP OF THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH HAS SPARED NO ONE NATION, DEVELOPED OR UNDERDEVELOPED. OUR EFFORTS TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE WORLD'S POOR PEOPLE IN ORDER TO MEET THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ARE BEING FRUSTRATED BY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE HAVE SEEN WITH OUR EYES IN JUST ONE GENERATION, HOW MUCH EFFECT CLIMATE CHANGE HAS HAD ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. I REMEMBER A TIME WHEN FORESTS WERE WITHIN A CHILD'S WALKING, DISTANCE TEEMING WITH A PROFUSION OF FLORA AND FAUNA. TODAY, OUR GRAND-CHILDREN WOULD BE LUCKY

TO NAME THE INDIGENOUS FRUITS OF OUR COUNTRY ON FIVE FINGERS. SO MANY SPECIES OF THESE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY; BECOME EXTINCT- FOREVER LOST TO THE WORLD IN SUCH A SHORT TIME. WE HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO WITNESS DISASTERS IN THE FORM OF DROUGHTS, WILD FIRES, FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES. IF NOT EXTREME LEVELS OF RAIN, IT IS THE LACK OF IT!
AS THE 23RD CONFERENCE OF STATE PARTIES (COP 23) ON CLIMATE CHANGE DRAWS NEAR, ZAMBIA IS EXPECTANT THAT THE CONFERENCE WILL, INTER ALIA; ESTABLISH MECHANISMS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE. FURTHERMORE, WE CALL ON ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE GREEN CLIMATE FUND (GCF) IS ADEQUATELY FUNDED IN ORDER TO HELP DELIVER THE NECESSARY INTERVENTIONS GLOBALLY.
AS A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, ZAMBIA NEEDS ASSISTANCE TO ENHANCE HER CAPACITY IN KEY ADAPTIVE AREAS LIKE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, EARLY WARNING, AND RAPID RESPONSE TO ADDRESS THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ACCORDINGLY, ZAMBIA CALLS FOR THE TRANSFER OF APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP COPE WITH THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
MR. PRESIDENT,
OVER THE PAST YEAR, ZAMBIA HAS REGISTERED IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTAL GAINS AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO FOSTER AN ALL-INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM BASED ON THE AFRICA UNION AGENDA 2063 AND THE UN AGENDA 2030 FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO ON 21sT JUNE, 2017, I HAD THE HONOUR TO LAUNCH THE SEVENTH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (7NDP), ZAMBIA'S DEVELOPMENTAL BLUEPRINT FOR THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD FROM 2017 UP TO 2021, UNDER THE THEME ""ACCELERATING DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TOWARDS THE A T TA INMEN T OF THE NA TI ONA L VISION 203 OWI THOU T LEA VING A N YONE BEHIND ',
THE PLAN SEEKS TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY IN AGRICULTURE, CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNSKILLED WAGE EMPLOYMENT IN OTHER SECTORS WITH GREATER POTENTIAL, LIKE MANUFACTURING. PARTICULAR ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO THE UPLIFTING OF STANDARDS OF LIVING IN THE RURALAREAS, WHERE A NEW FOCUS ON AGRO-VALUE ADDITION IS BEING IMPLEMENTED. THROUGH THIS PLAN ZAMBIA AIMS TO REDUCE POVERTY TO VERY MINIMAL LEVELS.
MY GOVERNMENT HAS INTEGRATED INTO THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING FRAMEWORK THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, THE AFRICAN UNION AGENDA 2063 AND ALL OTHER GLOBAL AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL INITIATIVES. WE ARE DETERMINED TO BUILD AN INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK WITHOUT LEAVING ANYONE BEHIND

FURTHERMORE, IN KEEPING WITH THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA (AAA) ON FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT, MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE MOBILIZATION AND USE OF ALL SOURCES OF FINANCE, WHETHER LOCALLY MOBILIZED OR THROUGH OUR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATING PARTNERS, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE AVERAGE PERSON IN ZAMBIA.
MR. PRESIDENT,
PEACE, SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW CONTINUE TO BE THE BASIS FOR MEANINGFUL DEVELOPMENT OF ANY SOCIETY. IN KEEPING WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING, MY GOVERNMENT PLEDGES ITS SOLIDARITY TO THOSE NATIONS THAT ARE UNDERTAKING THE NECESSARY ACTIONS IN DEEPENING THEIR DEMOCRACIES.
SINCE OUR LAST MEETING HERE IN NEW YORK, A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE HELD THEIR NATIONAL ELECTIONS. THE PEOPLE IN THESE COUNTRIES HAVE SPOKEN AND IN AFRICA, CONGRATULATIONS ARE DUE TO THEM FOR EXERCISING THEIRDEMOCRATIC RIGHT OF CHOICE IN THEIR NATIONAL ELECTIONS. THIS IS THE AFRICA WE WANT FOR THE 21sT CENTURY AND, INDEED, THE FUTURE WE WANT.
ZAMBIA HAS ALSO CONTINUED TO RENDER ITS SUPPORT FOR THOSE STILL AFFLICTED BY CONFLICT THROUGH ITS MEMBERSHIP IN THE AFRICAN UNION PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL. FOLLOWING ITS RECENT ELECTION, MY GOVERNMENT LOOKS FORWARD TO A SUCCESSFUL TENURE IN THE SADC TROIKA OF THE ORGAN ON POLITICS DEFENCE AND SECURITY, FROM 2017 TO 2020. I ASSURE YOU THAT, WE WILL USE THIS MEMBERSHIP IN THESE TWO BODIES TO FOSTER PEACE, MORE PARTICULARLY IN AFRICA.
MR.PRESIDENT,
WE MUST ALSO LEAN ON THE VISION AND EXPERIENCE OF THE VARIOUS REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES THAT ARE COMPLIMENTARY TO THIS ORGANIZATION'S AGENDA. AS A MEMBER STATE, WE NOTE THE ROLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH IN VARIOUS SUBJECTS SUCH AS GENDER AND YOUTH MATTERS, CLIMATE CHANGE, THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, GOOD GOVERNANCE, SOCI0-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND SO ON. IN MY COUNTRY, THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE DURING, AND AFTER THE PREVIOUSLY HELD ELECTIONS, THROUGH THE PROVISION OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN THE VARIOUS FACETS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.
MR. PRESIDENT
ZAMBIA HAS ALSO CONTINUED TO SERVE IN UN PEACE-KEEPING OPERATIONS WITH A SENSE OF DUTY TO THOSE PERSONS WHO HAVE FOUND THEIR SECURITY UNDER THREAT FOR VARIOUS REASONS. IN THIS
3

REGARD, THE UNITED NATIONS SHOULD NOT RELENT ON ITS DUTY TO THESE VULNERABLE PERSONS, BUT RATHER REDOUBLE ITS EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT A MORE PEACEFUL WORLD.
THE COMMITMENT SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO PREVENTING CONFLICT, BUT SHOULD GO FURTHER TO SEEK THE PROTECTION OF THE VICTIMS OF CONFLICT, INCLUDING THE DISPLACED PERSONS. WE ALL "" NEED TO COOPERATE IN PROVIDING FOR A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM IN RESPECT OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THEIR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND WELLBEING. IN THIS REGARD, I AM PLEASED TO INFORM THIS ASSEMBLY THAT IN JUNE THIS YEAR, I ASSENTED TO ZAMBIA'S REFUGEES ACT NO. 1, OF 2017 WHICH FURTHER SPEAKS TO THIS NOBLE DUTY AND, REPLACES THE 1970 LAW.
MR. PRESIDENT,
MY GOVERNMENT ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE NEEDS AND WELFARE OF ALL WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON WOMEN, CHILDREN AND YOUTH. TO THIS END, ZAMBIA CONTINUES TO MAKE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN THE CAMPAIGN TO END CHILD MARRIAGE, WITH THE PREVALENCE RATE CURRENTLY STANDING AT 31.2%, DEPICTING A 10.8 PERCENTAGE DROP FROM THE 42% AT INCEPTION OF THE CAMPAIGN.
WE HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO ENGAGE TRADITIONAL LEADERS TO REFORM TRADITIONS AND CUSTOMS THAT ALLOW CHILD MARRIAGE. CURRENTLY, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HARMONIZING STATUTORY AND CUSTOMARY LAW ON MARRIAGE TO PROHIBIT CHILD MARRIAGE. WE ARE ALSO REPEALING A NUMBER OF DISCRIMINATORY AND OUTDATED STATUTES RELATED TO CHILDREN IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH A CHILDRENS' CODE TO DOMESTICATE THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD.
AS THE DESIGNATED AFRICAN UNION CHAMPION ON ENDING CHILD MARRIAGE FOR 2017, I AM PLEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN LAUNCHED IN 20 COUNTRIES OUT OF THE 30 COUNTRIES TARGETED WITH THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE RATES OF CHILD MARRIAGE IN AFRICA. THE LAUNCH PROGRAMMES ARE ESSENTIAL TO ,THE ENHANCEMENT, OF ADVOCACY AGAINST CHILD MARRIAGE, AT NATIONAL LEVEL.
THE CAMPAIGN IS GROWING FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH; HOWEVER, MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. WE CALL ON ALL PARTNERS TO 10IN EFFORTS AND TOGETHER, LET US RAISE OUR VOICES TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND THE YOUTH. THE CAMPAIGN WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN MOMENTUM AND REACH OUT TO MEMBER STATES IN ORDER TO SECURE AN END TO THIS HARMFUL PRACTICE.

MR. PRESIDENT,
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE UNITED NATIONS CONTINUES TO REMAIN THE ONLY MULTILATERAL INSTITUTION CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF OUR ""ONE WORLD"". THE WORLD LOOKS UP TO THIS BODY TO ENCOURAGE DIALOGUE AMONG CIVILIZATIONS ON ALL GLOBAL CHALLENGES IN AN INCLUSIVE MANNER OFFERING THE ONLY PRACTICAL WAY TO ENSURE MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, TO BE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THERE IS NEED TO REFORM THE UNITED NATIONS. ZAMBIA BELIEVES THAT THE UN REFORMS WILL NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT MEANINGFUL REFORM ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL.
REFORM OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO MAKE IT MORE REPRESENTATIVE, DEMOCRATIC AND ACCOUNTABLE TO ALL MEMBER STATES, IRRESPECTIVE OF STATUS, IS ESSENTIAL FOR ITS DECISIONS TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE WHOLE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. GIVEN THAT AFRICA CONSTITUTES THE SECOND LARGEST BL0C OF THE UN MEMBERSHIP, PROPOSALS TO REFORM THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD HEED AFRICA'S LEGITIMATE CALL.
AFRICA IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL NEGOTIATION PROCESS, AND tT IS TIME TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE DELIBERATE ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A MAZE OF AN OTHERWISE CLEAR QUESTION.
MR. PRESIDENT
ZAMBIA IS GRATIFIED BY THE SIGNING OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BAN TREATY RECENTLY SIGNED IN JULY 2017. WE CONGRATULATE ALL THOSE WHO WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WITNESSING ITS COMING INT0 EFFECT.
IT IS HOWEVER SADDENING THAT WITHIN THE SAME TIMEFRAME, THE WORLD HAS WITNESSED AN ESCALATION IN THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR. RECENT EVENTS IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA ARE THEREFORE A SOURCE OF CONCERN TO ZAMBIA. I ONCE AGAIN, CALL UPON ALL CONCERNED NATIONS TO DE-ESCALATE THE TENSIONS AND TO COMMIT TO A PATH OF PEACE. IT IS ZAMBIA'S LONGSTANDING POSITION THAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE NOT A SOURCE OF SECURITY BUT RATHER, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.
MR, PRESIDENT
THE INCREASING ACTS OF TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD MUST BE CONDEMNED BY ALL PEACE LOVING NATIONS. MORE EFFORT MUST BE UNDERTAKEN TO RESTORE THE SENSE OF SECURITY WHICH IS UNDER CONSTANT THREAT. ZAMBIA THEREFORE STANDS IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE VICTIMS OF RECENT

TERROR ACTS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND FURTHER STANDS READY FOR ENHANCED INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION TO FIGHT TERRORISM.
MR. PRESIDENT,
IN CONCLUSION, I WISH TO REAFFIRM, ZAMBIA'S COMMITMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN ADDRESSING THE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS AFFECTING OUR WORLD. THESE TIMES DEMAND FOR BOLD LEADERSHIP FROM THE UNITED NATIONS AND ITS MEMBER STATES. LET US THEREFORE JOIN HANDS, AND ACT BOLDLY FOR THE SAKE 0F OUR FUTURE.
I THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT."
Zimbabwe,"Your Excellency, Miroslav Lajcak, President of the 72nd Session of the General Assembly, Your Majesties, Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, Your Excellency, Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of i,. the United Nations, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades and Friends.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate you on your election as the President of the Seventy Second Session of the General Assembly, and your predecessor Mr Thomson, for his commitment and effort to accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
i'
Mr. President, You could not have chosen a better and more relevant theme, given the times that we are living in. For, the pursuit and maintenance of peace and the promotion of development, in solidarity, lie at the core of the mission of the United Nations and its entire system.

Since the signing of the United Nations Charter seventy-two years ago, and in subsequent conventions, resolutions and declarations adopted over the decades, member states have sought to actualize the unquenchable human hope for peace, justice and ,progress.

Mr. President,

,

But the current global development agenda differs in significant ways from all those that

preceded it. It is ambitious, revolutionary, transformative, universal, and encompassing every

single facet of human life. For its success, this Agenda demands a radical, unprecedented

paradigm shift, in every sphere of human life.

Mr. President,

.

We cannot halt or reverse the continued destruction of our natural habitat or the rise in global

atmospheric temperature, without a change in contemporary production and consumption

patterns. This has been confirmed by scientific evidence. We cannot halt or reverse the persistent

widening gap between the rich and the poor among our nations, without deeper international

cooperation and genuine reform of the existing inequitable international system. The current

system is inherently structured to enrich a few and impoverish the many. It cannot, therefore,

deliver on a key aspiration and watchword objective of the 2030 Agenda, that of leaving no-one

behind.

Mr. President, For us in Africa, the current antiquated system perpetuates a historic injustice, one that can never ever be justified today. The 2030 Agenda represents new wine, and we call for a new wineskin lest we ruin the new wine. It is for this reason that I reiterate my country's unflinching support for the African Common Position on Security Council reform, commonly known as the Ezulwini Consensus.

Mr. President, The overwhelming majority of us have accepted that we need to reform the current system in order to improve, but not destroy it. Nonetheless, the negotiations and process intended to yield
2

the accepted reforms are painstakingly slow. We are left to wonder, justifiably so, whether those who enjoy, and sometimes abuse the power and privileges of the current set up, are sincere interlocutors in these discussions.
Mr. President, It is axiomatic that we harvest what we sow. Yet, by some strange logic, we expect to reap peace when we invest and expend so much, in treasure and technology,, in war.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military expenditure in 2016 amounted to approximately 1.6 Trillion dollars. In the same year, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Overseas Development Assistance amounted to approximately 142.6 billion dollars.
Those mega investments in ever more lethal weapons and more sophisticated war machinery have not resulted in greater peace or security. Instead, we have witnessed heart rending suffering and misery and increased mass movements of people fleeing wars and armed conflicts. This trend, Mr. President, should be halted, for the benefit of humanity.
Mr. President, We believe a different and better world is possible. In proposing and inviting us to focus on prevention, preventive diplomacy, peaceful resolution of conflicts, peace building and sustaining peace, the Secretary-General is pointing us in that desirable direction. We must also seriously tackle the multifaceted and complex root causes of conflict, including enduring poverty and deprivation, unequal access to resources, the denial of the rights to self-determination of peoples and interference in the internal affairs of other states, among other causes.
Mr. President, The continued denial of the right to self-determination to the peoples of Western Sahara and of Palestine who are living under colonial and foreign occupation; is immoral and an urgent issue for those seeking peace and security in our time. The Security Council has assumed its Charter responsibilities and has passed numerous resolutions. What remains is the enforcement and implementation of those resolutions.
We call on the Security Council to demonstrate its authority in ensuring the holding, without much further delay, of the independence referendum in Western Sahara. We expect the Security Council to work closely with the African Union, its proven partner for peace on the African Continent, in this effort.
The ever deteriorating situation and the continued suffering of the Palestinian people should spur the Security Council to renewed, time-framed efforts to bring about the two-state solution already defined in numerous General Assembly and Security Council Resolutions.
Mr. President, Development and peace are conjoined and cannot be separated. My country has embraced the 2030 Agenda as an integrated and comprehensive approach to address the myriad and complex national and global challenges in solidarity and in cooperation with other stakeholders.

Zimbabwe was honoured to be among some other forty plus countries that participated in the Voluntary National Review at the 2017 High Level Political ForUm in July.
We were, and still are, pleased to share with other countries our experiences and to learn from others their experiences in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. We recognize the need for beneficial partnerships both within and outside of our national borders. One of our key partners is the United Nations System with which, I am happy to note, we work very closely. I wish in this regard, to welcome the Secretary-General's initiative to ensure that the support of UN country teams will be guided by national priorities. This will ensure national ownership and leadership of the development processes as well as the sustainability of development projects and programmes. This, Mr. President, is what we are experiencing iniZimbabwe.
Mr. President, My country is an unflinching advocate for the respect of the sovereignty and independence of countries. We therefore strongly defend and respect the right of Each country to take decisions in exercising its sovereign rights. We cannot, however, remain silent when those decisions impact, or have the potential to negatively affect our own welfare.
Climate change, Mr. President, is a present reality and so are its effects and impacts. Climate change is global. We cannot remain silent when a major economic power in the world, or any other state for that matter, decides to abandon the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and thus put our countries at further risk of the effects of climate change such as more frequent and severe droughts. It is vital that we all play our part, in keeping with the provisions of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, in order to halt the inexorable march towards the destruction of that upon which our own existence depends.
Mr. President, As I conclude my remarks, it is worth reminding each other that the world today, by its very interconnectedness, demands more not less solidarity; more not less cooperation; more not less multilateralism. We have brought more and more issues under the global agenda and within the global discourse. This acknowledgement has found expression in the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Our survival and progress calls for reinforced solidarity, partnerships and cooperation. This is a call to which we all must respond positively and actively. Zimbabwe is already doing so.
Thank you.
