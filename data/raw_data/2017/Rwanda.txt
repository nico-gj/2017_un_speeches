UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
General Debate of the 72nd Regular Session
New York, 20 September 2017

• Excellencies, Heads of State and Government
• Excellency, President of the General Assembly
• Distinguished Delegates
• Ladies and Gentlemen

Every year, the United Nations channels billions of
dollars in humanitarian assistance. It also sets the
global

agenda

on

key

policy

issues,

from

development, to women’s rights, while providing a
platform for major international agreements.
These are signs of an organisation that is both
relevant, and, in many cases, competent.
And yet there is a sense, that the United Nations is
not meeting our needs and expectations.

2/5

In this context, I would like to commend the
Secretary General, for the two important initiatives
he championed this week, on United Nations
reform, and response to sexual exploitation and
abuse.
These steps go to the heart of the matter: the
deficit

of

trust

and

accountability,

in

the

international system.
To be truly effective at delivering a “decent life for
all”, the United Nations must treat all the people it
serves with impartiality and respect, and it must
be a good steward of the funds entrusted to it.
Abuse and waste are therefore not a mere public
relations problem, but an existential threat, which
must be tackled head-on.
The Secretary General deserves our full support, to
make the United Nations not only effective, but
transformational.

3/5

We have the tools and the mandates to address
the global challenges of our day, from climate
change, to peace-building, to human equality and
development.
Where we fall short, is in getting things done.
Institutional reform is not a one-off event, like
applying a fresh coat of paint.
The essence of reform, is a mindset of constantly
striving to improve performance and delivery, and
holding ourselves responsible for shortcomings
and results.
In this sense, the reform spirit, that has started to
take root in both the United Nations and the
African Union, is encouraging, and Rwanda is
happy to be associated with both.
This positive momentum also positions the United
Nations and the African Union, to work more
closely together.

4/5

Concrete steps can be taken on both sides, to
improve

the

quality

of

coordination

and

consultation.
The African Union and the United Nations are
already

good

partners

in

peacekeeping,

and

Rwanda is proud to have forces serving under both
flags. But we can do much more, and do it better.
We also share the common objective, to meet the
Sustainable

Development

Goals

and

Africa’s

Agenda 2063 targets, as well as continue to
enhance women’s empowerment.
Closer
growing

collaboration
digital

will

divide

help

us bridge

through

the

universal

broadband access, which connects our people to
networks of knowledge and prosperity.
Canada

and

Rwanda,

together

with

other

stakeholders, are working to raise awareness of
the tremendous impact we can have, right away,
by

ratifying

and

implementing

Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.

the

Kigali

5/5

This is among the most important actions that a
country can take, to directly tackle climate change,
and

re-affirm

the

commitment

to

the

Paris

Agreement. Fewer than 15 additional ratifications
are needed, in order for the Kigali Amendment to
come into force, in 2019.
Mr President, distinguished delegates:
Our world faces difficult challenges, but no more
so, than in the past. Working together, in a
constructive spirit, we can assure our children, the
future they deserve.
I thank you very much, for your kind attention.
