REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

Madam President,

On September 24^ we celebrated the
100*^ anniversary of the birth of President
Nelson

Mandela

"Madiba"

and

had

the

opportunity to reflect on the life and
accomplishments of this great humanist. The
former South African president was an
example of courage,
abnegation,
and
tolerance. Mandela fought for freedom, justice,
democracy, and a society where all people
may live together with equality and in harmony.
This is a great lesson that will continue to serve
as a source of inspiration for us and future
generations.

Madam President,

Honorable Heads of State and Government,

In

his

last

report

on

the

Organization's

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

activities, the Secretary-General reminds us
that, for many peoples, peace is still a goal that
is difficult to reach. As our much-missed Kofi

Annan said: "peace is a hung dream."
Indeed, many conflicts persist around the
world, and many people continue to suffer the
destruction of war. Many deaths, including
those of children, and millions of people who
are forced to abandon their homes, their cities,

in search of asylum, leaving part of their
families and possessions acquired during a
lifetime of work.
We

cannot

remain

indifferent

to

so

much

suffering and despair by thousands of people,
including children, seeking protection and
asylum, particularly in Europe.
The situation in Palestine, as well as Yemen

and Syria, continue to be a source of great
concern for the international community.
In the African

continent,

internal

tensions

in the Sahel, which are spreading fear among

the
population
and
preventing
their
governments from focusing on development
issues, and on creating the best life conditions
for their citizens.

Climate change has caused increasingly more
frequent droughts and floods in many parts of
the world. Many island countries face the risks
of disappearing due to rising sea levels. These
challenges require from ail of us efforts, new
attitudes, and more responsible behaviors.
Above all, we must rigorously meet the
commitments undertaken in the Paris Accord.

Madam President,

I believe that we all have an obligation under
the Charter of the United Nations to which we

ail subscribe, and must respect it whatever the
circumstances, as the Principles contained
therein are the foundation and basis for a world

order based on rules. Specifically, the principle

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

of peaceful resolution of disputes, the non
interference

in

countries,

and

the

internal

affairs of other

multilateralism

as

the

cornerstone to build international peace and
security.

We live in a global village, where all are
responsible, not only for what happens within
our own territories, given the interdependence
of countries. One country's national policies
may gravely affect all other countries. This
demands shared responsibility.

In this regard, I must not fail to address the
issue of Security Council reform, particularly
better representation of the African continent,
in order to enhance the legitimacy of this
principal United Nations organization.

Madam President,

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

Honorable Heads of State and Government,

Ladies and gentlemen,
I wish to take this opportunity before this
august assembly to briefly share the current
political situation in Guinea-Bissau, as well as
results achieved.

Last April, in Lome, Togo, as the Heads of
State

and

Government

of

the

Economic

Community of West African States, we arrived
at an important decision toward permanently
overcoming the political and constitutional
impasse that had been in place in my country
for more than three years.
As Head of State, and in the name of building
peace and stability in my country and the subregion, I have pursued the recommendations
coming out of the Conference, namely:
• Appointment
Minister;

of

the

consensus

Prime

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

Scheduling of a date for legislative elections
on November 18, 2018;

These recommendations have been fully implemented, with the following results!

• The formation of a Government of inclusion in

accordance with the Conakry Agreement;

• The reopening of our National People's
Assembly;
• The extension of the terms of Assembly
members;
• The election of the members of the National

Electoral Commission (CNE);

• The approval of the Government Program
and the General State Budget;
Madam President,
Recent political, social, and economic events
bear witness that the Bissau-Guinean people and

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

our armed forces, together (mobilized), said no to
instability and embarked on a path of peace and
development.

The process for our elections on November 18*^
is underway, and we started to register voter on

the 19*^ of this month, despite some delays due to
technical and financial reasons.

Please note that, for the first time in the history
of our Bissau-Guinean democracy, a legislative
session has been completed without any
interruptions caused by coup d'etats and/or
other incidents.

Accordingly, on this past August 30*^, the
Security Council took notice of the positive
developments in the political stability in our
country. I would also note that, as in previous
reports, we were congratulated on the
republican attitudes of the Armed Forces,
which has displayed a notable sense of civic
duty in recent years.
I take this

opportunity to

appeal

to the

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

international community and the members of
the Security Council, which has exclusive
prerogatives with respect to this matter, in the
name of justice and nationai harmony, for the
iifting of sanctions imposed on some officiais of
our Armed Forces.

Such decision, which has been desired and

expected for so long, would certainly help to
consolidate our democratic institutions and to

bring about lasting peace in our country.

Madam President,

Heads of Delegations,
Peace is essential for successful development.

But peace is not just the absence of armed
conflict.

There can be no peace when a iarge portion, if
not most, of the population, particularly women
and youth, are not sufficiently valued, when
their education is considered iess important,
when their contribution to the economic growth
10

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

of our country is not recognized or fairly
compensated, when women are not, in parity
with men, in positions of influence, and are
ignored as the pillar of society.

In my country, we recently took significant
steps toward ensuring equal representation for
men and women. The Parliament of Guinea-

Bissau approved a Law that guarantees a
minimum representation quota of 36% for
women in positions of note, particularly in the
National
People's
Assembly
and
in
Government.

As President of the Republic and guarantor of
national equity and unity, I am particularly
pleased and grateful for these national
advances.

Madam President,

Ladies and gentiemen,

I would like to conclude my remarks by
reaffirming Guinea-Bissau's commitment to the
11

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

Office of the Presidency

principles enshrined in the Charter of the
United Nations and to the important, unique,
and irreplaceable role of our Organization.

We must join forces in order to better manage
globalization, eradicate poverty and hunger,
combat major endemic diseases, as well as
guarantee education and potable water for all
in order to implement the Sustainable
Development Goals by 2030.
Let us be solidary and demonstrate our
compassion for those who are fleeing
persecution, war, and misery, particularly

migrants and refugees, victims of political
crises

and

natural

calamities,

who

are

desperately knocking on our doors.
In a solidary and brotherly world, we will be in a
better position to build a better future for future
generations.
Thank you very much!
