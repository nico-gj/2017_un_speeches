Madame President of the

Session of UN General Assembly, Ms Maria Fernanda

Espinosa,

Secretary General, Mr Antonio Guterres,
Excellencies Heads of State and Government,

Majesties,

Heads of Delegation,
Colleagues,
Ladles and Gentleman,

I have the honour to address this august body, the United Nations General Assembly for the
first time as President of the Republic of South Africa.

It Is nearly a quarter of a century since the founding father of our democracy, President
Nelson Rollhlahia Mandela stood at this podium to declare that:

"The millions across our globe who stand expectant at the gates of hope look to this
organisation [the United Nations], to bring them peace, to bring them life, to bring them a
life worth living."
As we mark the centenary of the birth of this great global leader, we are bound to ask
whether the United Nations has met the needs and the expectations of the millions who
stand at the gates of hope.

We are bound to ask what contribution the United Nations has made to a more peaceful,
more prosperous and more equal world.
More Importantly, we are called upon to ask - as we did yesterday during the Nelson
Mandela Peace Summit - what the United Nations and the assembled global leadership
must do to secure lasting peace, reconciliation and stability across the globe.

Allow me to express the deep gratitude of the government and the people of South Africa to
the international community for convening the Peace Summit to honour the memory of
Nelson Mandela and advance his legacy.
We applaud the Political Declaration of the Summit, which recognises the period from 2019
to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace.

This reflects a new and sincere commitment by the world's leaders to comprehensively
advance peace and security and resolve all conflicts and wars.

To succeed In giving effect to this commitment, the UN must become what billions of people
across the world want It to be - a representative and truly democratic global parliament of
the people.

Throughout Its seven decades, the UN has been a source of hope for the oppressed,
exploited and poor.

During the dark days of colonialism and apartheid, we drew strength, inspiration and
encouragement from the UN and its Charter in our quest for self-determination.
To the poor, vulnerable, and marginalised, the UN today is a beacon of promise in a
landscape of doubt.

To billions across the world, the UN is the most powerful instrument we possess to achieve a
more equal, more humane and more inclusive world.

They are men and women with dreams and aspirations that transcend the hardships of the
present, who want to contribute to a new global civilization defined by compassion, justice
and solidarity.

They want an end to the greed, ignorance and conceit that is driving the destruction of our
only home, the earth.
It is within our hands, as the leaders assembled here today, to forge a more representative,

equal and fair United Nations that is empowered and equipped to lead the struggle to end
poverty, unemployment and inequality in the world.
We are a youthful world, where more than half the global population is under the age of 30
years.

One of the greatest challenges to the achievement of global prosperity and development is
the continued exclusion of millions of women and young people from meaningful economic
participation.
It is therefore vital that we deploy every means at our disposal to address youth
unemployment and ensure universal access to educational opportunities that are appropriate
to the changing world of work.

We need a deliberate programme to ensure that the digital revolution - which carries such
great potential for both disruption and empowerment - is effectively harnessed to promote
social justice and human progress.

The call to leave no one behind requires that we strengthen the institutions of global
governance and make them more responsive to the needs of young people, particularly in
the developing world.
This is even more pronounced on our continent, Africa, where two-thirds of its people were
not yet born when Nelson Mandela was released from prison.
This places a responsibility on us, as leaders, not only to put the interests of young people at
the centre of our efforts, but also to empower women and young people to be more
prominent in directing the course of global affairs.
It is young people who are fighting the wars that we started.

It is women who are bearing the brunt and hardships of the wars that continue to destroy
their families and lives.

As we speak, young lives are being lost and futures are being destroyed.
There is an urgency to the measures we must take to end conflict and war.

Not only must we stop the death, destruction and human suffering that is visited daily on
millions of people, but we must act with purpose to prevent the loss of another entire
generation to its aftermath.

We must accept our shared responsibility - and our shared interest - in ending conflict, and,
using the outcomes of the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, to empower the United Nations
to be a more effective instrument for mediation, peace keeping and post-conflict
reconstruction. In this spirit it is crucial that we should preserve the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action with Iran, which was one of the most important breakthroughs in international
diplomacy in recent times.

Our resolve to end ongoing conflicts and our determination to root out terrorism must be
matched by action and by the appropriate deployment of resources.

We must act with the same urgency to resolve some of the world's most protracted and
intractable disputes.

The fact that the people of Palestine have endured occupation and suffering for nearly as
long as the United Nations has existed, makes their plight no less pressing, nor their
suffering any less acceptable.

We must similarly intensify our efforts to secure the right of the people of Western Sahara to
self-determination and full national sovereignty.
Institutions like the United Nations, World Bank, IMF and the WTO need to be reshaped and

enhanced so that they may more effectively meet the challenges of the contemporary world
and better serve the interests of the poor and marginalised.
Reform of the United Nations, and particularly its Security Council, is a priority if we are to
give full effect to the values and principles enshrined in the UN Charter. In this regard. South
Africa would like to express its profound gratitude for the strong mandate it received to be a
non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2019 to 2020.
We must resist any and all efforts to undermine the multilateral approach to international
trade, which is essential to the promotion of stability and predictability in the global economy.
The history of the global economy informs us that no country can prosper at the expense of
all others, and that no people can hope to live in comfort and security for as long as millions
of others languish in poverty.
It is therefore essential that we take collective responsibility for the development of all
nations and for the improvement of the lives of all people.

This responsibility is manifest in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris
Agreement on Climate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on the financing of
development, among others.

Together, they represent our common commitment to tackle poverty, underdevelopment and
environmental degradation.
They represent our common commitment to tackle diseases like Aids, tuberculosis, malaria,
diabetes and cancer.

Our task as global leaders is to pursue the policies that are required to turn intent into
implementation and mobilise the resources needed to turn implementation into impact.
Your Excellencies,

As Africans, we have made significant strides in addressing the challenges that have
confronted our continent over many decades.
We continue to vigorously implement our commitments contained in the African Union
Agenda 2063, which is our collective plan to rid our continent of underdevelopment, poverty
and conflict and improve democratic governance, the rule of law and the promotion of
human rights.
We have reached agreement on the establishment of an African Continental Free Trade
Area, which will fundamentally transform African economies, giving rise to a new industrial
age on the continent.
We are working to silence the guns in Africa by 2020, to bring an end to conflicts that have
cost the lives of millions of our people, displaced many more and stunted economic growth
and human development.

As the continent with the youngest population in the world, Africa has the potential to be the
next great frontier for global growth.

With effective investment in education, improved health care, good governance and greater
economic integration, Africa has the potential to develop its productive capacity on a scale
and at a rate that will lift tens of millions out of poverty.
The youth of Africa are poised to transform their continent.

Allow me to conclude by once more drawing on the wisdom of Nelson Mandela, when he
said: "Sometimes it falls on a generation to be great."

This is not the generation that will stand expectant at the gates of hope. This Is the
generation that will change the world. This is their time, and this is their age.
Let their greatness blossom.

I thank you.
