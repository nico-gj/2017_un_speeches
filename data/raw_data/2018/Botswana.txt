BY

HIS EXCELLENCY MR. MOKGWEETSI E.K. MASISI
PRESIDENT
OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA

DURING THE GENERAL DEBATE

OF THE 73'^°SESSION OF THE
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY

27 SEPTEMBER 2018

UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK

BOTSWANA',;
Please check against delivery.

Madam President,
Excellencies,
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,

1.

It is Indeed an honour and privilege for me to address the
General Assembly for the first time in my capacity as the
President of the Republic of Botswana, after assuming Office on

l" April, this year.
z.

I succeeded former President Lt. General Dr. Seretse Khama

Ian Khama, who retired at the end of his term of Office. This
was the fifth time that Botswana witnessed a smooth transfer

of power since her independence in 1966.
3.

Allow me to join other delegations in paying tribute to the
Former Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr.

Annan, who passed away on 18 August 2018.

Kofi

Mr. Annan will

be remembered as an international statesman and icon who

devoted his entire life towards serving humanity.

He was

relentless in championing peace and prosperity for all.

Madam President,

4.

Let me also join other delegations in congratulating you on
your election as President of the Seventy-Third Session of the
United Nations General Assembly.

5.

It is particularly noteworthy as this is only the fourth time a
woman has held this esteemed position since the founding of
our world body Seventy-three (73) years ago, and the first
woman from the Latin America and the Caribbean Region.

6.

I would like to assure you of the full support and cooperation of
my delegation, as you discharge your mandate and wish you
success.

7.

Let me also seize this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr.

Miroslav

Lajcak,

who

competently

presided

over

the

deliberations of the Seventy-Second (72) Session.

8.

I also wish to thank our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr.

Antonio

Guterres,

for

his

outstanding

leadership

and

stewardship of this Organisation. I wish to principally commend
him for the reforms he has initiated, which are aimed at
improving

the

effectiveness and

efficiency of the

United

Nations.

Madam President,

9.

My delegation welcomes the theme for the General Debate of

the 73'"'' Session of the United Nations General Assembly,
namely

"Making the

United Nations

Relevant to All

People: Global Leadership and Shared Responsibilities
for Peacefui, Equitabie and Sustainable Societies".

10. We are particularly pleased to note that it builds on last year's
theme which focused on people, and also emphasised the
nexus between peace and a decent life for all. This evidently
shows the United Nations' steadfast commitment to ensuring
sustainable development for all.

11. This theme no doubt further inspires us to take collective
responsibility towards the attainment of the lofty purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as, the

universal

goals

of

the

2030

Agenda

for

Sustainable

Development. These global fundamental blueprints succinctly

outline the conditions necessary for building peaceful, equitable
and sustainable societies.

12. Clearly, the principle of leaving no one behind should remain
our lodestar and long term aspiration. This is a clarion call for
us to end extreme poverty and ensure provision of quality

education,

health

employment for all.

and

Madam President,

13. I am pleased that the Sustainable Development Goals Report
of 2018 Indicates that more people are living healthier lives
than it was the case a decade ago. That notwithstanding, we
should be reminded that much more still needs to be done to

achieve prosperity for all.

This is in view of fact that an

estimated 783 million people live in extreme poverty and 2.3
billion people still lack access to basic level of sanitation
service, while 4 billion people are without social protection.

14. It is therefore apparent that none of us, whether big or small,
can overcome these gigantic development challenges alone.

Consequently,

we

partnerships for sustainable development.

15. It is also imperative that the global community should continue
to support individual countries given their unique development
challenges. For instance, while Botswana is classified as an
Upper Middle Income country, it is still confronted by many
development

challenges

comparable to

that

of the

less

developed countries. However, we are reassured by the words
of the UN Secretary-General when he opined that the United

Nations: "stands ready to work with all Member States to

make the Sustainable Development Goals a reality for
everyone, everywhere".

16. In view of the development challenges facing my country, I

wish to reiterate our appeal for continued support in human
capital, infrastructure and capacity development for the private
sector and technology transfer.

Sustainable Development

Madam President,

17. Botswana reaffirms her commitment to the implementation of

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To this end, we
have aligned our Vision 2036 to this Global Agenda. At the
regional level, we are also pleased that the African Union

Agenda

2063

and

the

Southern

African

Development

Community (SADC) Integration Agenda is aligned to the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development
18. What is common about these development agendas is that
they are both aimed at eradicating poverty and creating
inclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies. In this respect,
we are pleased to note that extreme poverty continues to

decline globally, even though we still have a long way to go
given that 35®/o of the African population, or 395 million
people, still live in abject poverty.

19. As we begin the third year of the implementation of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development, my Government remains
steadfast in her resolve to improve the material and social

well-being

of our

population.

Agenda places People,

Our

Planet,

National

Peace and

Partnership at the heart of sustainable development. In this

regard, our National Vision 2036 is anchored on four pillars of
Sustainable Economic Development; Human and Social
Development;

Sustainable

Environment;

and

Governance, Peace and Security.

20. In addition, we have six national priorities that are aligned to
our National Vision pillars, namely. Developing Diversified
Sources

of

Economic

Growth;

Human

Development; Social Development; Sustainable Use of
National Resources; Consolidation of Good Governance

and

and

21. In this way, our sustainable development pathway strikes a
balance between social, human, economic, environmental and
governance dimensions.

22. The implementation of our National Vision 2035 and Eleventh

National

Development

Plan

is

underpinned

by

a

robust

monitoring and evaluation system to ensure effective delivery
of goals and aspirations.

23. Additionally,

and

monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals. We have
also developed Botswana SDGs Roadmap: A Guide to
Implementation

of

Sustainable

Development

Goals,

covering the period from 2017 to 2023.

Madam President,

24. My Government has adopted a comprehensive and inclusive

approach to the implementation and monitoring of Sustainable
Development

Goals.

This

was

aimed

at

ensuring

broad

ownership and leadership at local, community and national
levels and to break silos across the development spectrum
through forging strategic partnerships between Government,
academia.

Civil

Society

Organisations,

community

based

organisations,

Development Partners,

Private Sector, Non-

State Actors and the UN system.

25. In pursuit of these goals and aspirations, we have prioritised
economic

diversification,

sustainable

economic

growth,

employment creation and investment in human capital for
building a prosperous and inclusive society.

26. In particular, focus is on our young people, who constitute
60% of the population of Botswana. To this end, our ultimate

goal is to attain universal access to pre-primary, primary and
secondary education. We are also expanding access to tertiary,
technical and vocational education and training.

27. In addition, we are developing a National Employment Policy

whose objectives are to assist Botswana to achieve gainful and

productive employment and decent work for all.

28. Above all, the Government of Botswana has developed several

policies, programmes and strategies, such as; the Economic
Diversification Drive (EDD), Citizen Economic Empowerment

Policy, Youth Empowerment Scheme (YES) and the Youth
Development Fund (YDF), to support sustainable economic
development and employment creation.

Madam President,

29. To

ensure

that

development

is

a

benefit

for

all,

my

Government continues to make substantial investments in the

provision of health care, decent housing and shelter, through
interventions such as, the Treat All Strategy, Prevention of

Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, Self-help Housing Agency
(SHHA) Housing Scheme and Destitute Housing programme.

30. Additionally, the Government provides social protection to
vulnerable groups such as children, youth, persons living with

disabilities and the elderly, through the Out of School Children
Policy, Orphan Care Programme and the Old Age Pension

Scheme. Other development Interventions aimed at increasing
access to economic and social opportunities include poverty

eradication, women and youth empowerment, and National
Policy on Gender and Development.

31. Furthermore, we have prioritised investments in research and

development, science, technology and innovation in order to
transform Botswana into a high-income status nation and
knowledge-based economy. Investment in Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) is undertaken to promote
growth

and

economic

diversification

and

to

support

Government service and innovation in the economy.

32. Let me take this opportunity to thank the UN Secretary-

General

for establishing the

High-Level

Panel

on

Digital

Cooperation and appointing Honourable Bogolo Kenewendo,
our Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry, as a member

of this Panel. We are confident that it will help devise ways on

how new digital technologies can be used to deliver on our
development goals.

Madam President,

33. We note that the implementation of the ambitious 2030

Agenda for Sustainable Development faces immense resource
and capacity constraints. In this respect, we welcome the
efforts of the United Nations to address these challenges

through the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 72/279
on Repositioning of the United Nations Development System in
May this year.

34. This Resolution is vital in that it aims to support countries in

their efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable

Development. It is our firm conviction that strengthened
United

Nations country teams and

Coordinator

systems

will

contribute

35. Equally, Botswana welcomes the signing of the African UnionUnited Nations Framework for the Implementation of Agenda
2063 and the Agenda 2030, to ensure effective coordination,
execution, monitoring and reporting on these two development
agendas.

36. This coordination will hopefully ensure that there

is no

duplication of efforts, thus allowing for the effective use of our
already limited resources.

Madam President,

37. In order to demonstrate our abiding faith to Sustainable
Development Goal No. 17 on Partnerships for the Goals, my

Government has developed the South-South and Triangular
Cooperation Strategy. I therefore wish to express our profound
gratitude

to

the

United

Nations

for

its

and

Human Rights

Madam President,

38. Botswana remains committed to the promotion and protection

of human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of
law, which are critical to sustainable development, prosperity,
peace and security.

39. In this connection, we continue to support efforts to fight

impunity

and

the

principle

of

responsibility

to

protect

populations from atrocities, such as genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In this regard,
we reaffirm our full support of the United Nations Human

Rights Council and the International Criminal Court.

40. This

year,

the

International

Criminal

Court

achieved

a

milestone when it commemorated the 20'*^ Anniversary of the
adoption of the Rome Statute that founded this Court. Since its
formation

2002,

the

Court has

the

international criminal justice system through prosecution of

41. We are also pleased to note that this year marks the 70"^
Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and

the 20'*^ Anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders. These two Declarations stress the

importance of protecting and defending human rights.

42. In this respect, it is disheartening to note that approximately
1, 019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists
were killed in 61 countries since 2015.

43. We warmly welcome the appointment of Her Excellency Dr.

Michelle Bachelet, the former President of Chile, as the United
Nations

High

Commissioner

for

Human

Rights.

Her

appointment is yet another testament of the Secretary-

General's commitment to gender parity in senior leadership
positions.

44. I pledge my country's full support and commit to cooperate
with her Office. I also thank her predecessor, H.E. Zeid Ra'ad

Al Hussein, for his tireless and courageous leadership in the
promotion and protection of human rights worldwide.

JjL

International Peace and Security

Madam President,

45. Botswana remains deeply concerned about the protracted

conflicts in Afghanistan, Mali, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
It is estimated that over the past decade, violent conflicts have
led to forced displacement of over 68.5

million people.

Studies show that conflicts contribute to the rise in slums,

hunger

and

food

insecurity,

thereby

worsening

any

humanitarian crises.

46. We therefore urge all parties to the conflict to uphold their
obligation to protect civilians and humanitarian personnel in
accordance with international human rights and humanitarian

law. We also wish to stress that dialogue and
resolution

of

conflicts

are

critical

to

the

peaceful

maintenance

international peace and security.

47. Botswana welcomes and applauds the efforts made by the
United Nations to deal with threats to international peace and

security,

particularly

terrorism,

violent

extremism,

transnational organised crime and proliferation of small arms
and light weapons.

iS.

48. We also commend the Secretary-General for initiating reforms

in the peace and security pillar aimed at strengthening the
United Nations capacities in conflict prevention and resolution,

mediation,

peacemaking,

peacekeeping,

post-conflict

reconstruction and development, peacebuilding and sustaining
peace.

49. To bolster international peacemaking efforts, African leaders
have committed themselves to fund 25% of peace support
operations in Africa by 2021 and silencing the guns by 2020.

50. I therefore wish to applaud Member States of the Economic

Community

of Central

African

States

(ECCAS)

and

the

Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for

adopting the Lome Declaration on Peace, Security, Stability,
and the Fight Against Terrorism and Violent Extremism, in July

this year. We firmly believe that this Declaration will go a long
way in addressing peace and security challenges in the Central
and West African regions, particularly terrorist threats in the
Lake Chad Basin and the Sahel-Saharan region.

Madam President,

51. Botswana further welcomes the signing of the Joint Declaration

of Peace and Friendship by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of
—

L6

Ethiopia and President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea in Juiy this
year,

aimed

at

normaiising

relations

between

these two

neighbouring countries. It is our hope that this Declaration will

herald peace, stability and security in the horn of Africa. It was
indeed a momentous occasion when direct flights between the
two nations' capitals were launched.

Madam President,

52. I am pleased to inform that Botswana has adopted a broad and

holistic approach to amend all relevant legislation such as
Counter-Terrorism Act, Financial Intelligence Act and Arms and
Communications Act with a view to strengthening measures

aimed at countering and combating international terrorism, as
well as combating money laundering.

International Migration

Madam President,

53. Migration is critical to inclusive and sustainable economic
growth and development. Sustainable Development Goal 10,
Target 10.7 of the 2030 Agenda calls on United Nations
Member

States

to

"facilitate

orderly,

safe,

regular

and

responsible migration and mobility of people, including through
17

the implementation of planned and well-managed migration
policies."

54. In

this

respect,

my delegation

welcomes the successful

conclusion of the intergovernmental negotiations on the Global

Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in July this
year.

Botswana

negotiated

supports

Agreement

this

that

first,

inter-governmentally

provides

a

holistic

and

comprehensive approach to manage international migration.
We look forward to its adoption in Marrakesh, Morocco this
year.

Corruption

Madam President,

55. As the global community we need to address the problems of

illicit financial flows, money-laundering and corruption, which
are haemorrhaging the resources needed to implement the
Sustainable Development Goals.

56. Sustainable Development Goal 16 calls for, among others,
substantial reduction of corruption and bribery in all their

forms, strengthening the recovery and return of stolen assets

ia.

and

developing

effective,

accountable

and

transparent

institutions at all levels.

57. In accordance with this global commitment, African leaders in

January of this year, declared 2018 as the Year for Combating
Corruption, with the theme "Winning the Fight against
Corruption:

A

Sustainable

Path

to

Africa's

Transformation." This was an opportune theme to mark the

15"^ Anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations
Convention against Corruption. Most importantly it was an

opportunity for a renewed commitment in the fight against
corruption.

58. Botswana continues to intensify efforts to prevent and combat
corruption through its Directorate on Corruption and Economic

Crime (DCEC). In order to strengthen the anti-corruption
legislation,

my Government is at an

advanced stage of

finalising the draft Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Bill,
which we believe will emhance integrity, transparency and

accountability in Government. This Bill will complement the

Whistle Blowing Act and the Proceeds and Instruments of
Crime Act.

JiL

Conclusion

Madam President,

59. In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Botswana's commitment to

the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and

to the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development.

60. Let us not falter,

but move forward towards attaining

sustainable development.

We should not allow whatever

challenges that cross our path to deter us, as we know, Rome
was not built in a day.

61. Our actions should be bold and transformative as we build a

better future our nations succeeding generations. We should

stand firm towards our mantra of "leaving no one behind".
Let us not be hesitant In demonstrating global leadership,

collective

responsibility

and

collaborative

involving all countries and peoples of the world.

62. The future Is In our hands

I thank you for your kind attention.
